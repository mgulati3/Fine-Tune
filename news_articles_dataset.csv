President Trump's massive spending and tax cut bill is on the way to his desk for a signature. The bill passed Thursday after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives convinced holdouts in their own party to get in line behind the controversial legislation.
House Republicans passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214, nearly entirely along party lines. All 212 Democrats voted in unison against the bill, and they were joined by two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. Leaders were forced to work all night to win the votes necessary to pass the bill and meet Trump's demand to sign the bill by July 4.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pledged in a speech on the House floor that the bill would make the U.S. ""stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.""
""Today we are laying a key cornerstone of America's new golden age,"" he said.
Politics
Here's what's inside the GOP megabill
The sprawling GOP bill — clocking in at nearly 1,000 pages — represents a dramatic realignment of the federal government's role in American life, shifting resources from the social safety net and investments in clean energy, and reorienting them to finance trillions of dollars in new spending on tax cuts, immigration enforcement and national defense.
Trump was heavily involved in selling the bill to skeptical lawmakers, including calling them to the White House for talks throughout the day on Wednesday.
Trump also weighed in repeatedly on social media throughout the night, demanding that lawmakers finish the job.
""Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!"" Trump wrote just after midnight.
The legislative effort fulfills
key campaign pledges
that Trump made during his reelection bid — including making hefty tax cuts passed during his first term permanent. But it violates a key promise too: Trump promised repeatedly during the campaign not to touch Medicaid benefits, the joint federal and state program that provides health care for more than 70 million low-income, elderly and disabled Americans.
Sponsor Message
Republicans say they are targeting waste, fraud and abuse in the program, and the bill makes significant changes to work requirements and ways the program is funded. The Congressional Budget Office, a
nonpartisan group
of professional staffers who provide information and analysis to support the legislative process, estimates that the cuts could result in nearly 12 million people losing health coverage.
Democrats rallied against the bill but could not block or change it
Democrats warned throughout the day and night that the legislation contains major cuts to the social safety net, including food aid and insurance coverage for millions of Americans.
Before the vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., spoke on the House floor for 8 hours and 44 minutes in a wide-ranging speech, railing against Republicans and the impact of the bill.
The speech broke the record for the longest leadership speech in the history of the House of Representatives. The previous record, of 8 hours, 32 minutes, was set by then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in 2021.
During the speech, Jeffries read letters from people insured through Medicaid, including many who said they live in congressional districts represented by Republicans. Jeffries called the bill  ""an immoral document.""
""Everybody should vote no against it because of how it attacks children and seniors and everyday Americans. And people with disabilities,"" Jeffries said. ""That is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representative with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have.""

The package also comes with a hefty price tag. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will
increase the deficit
— how much money the government spends over the amount it brings in — by $3.4 trillion over 10 years.

The GOP's massive bill would add trillions of dollars to the country's debt
These issues were the focus of significant debate during both Senate and House deliberations over the bill. The House passed an initial version
in late May
, although it changed in the Senate as lawmakers incorporated additional cuts to Medicaid and a higher increase to the debt limit.
Republican concerns dragged negotiations through the night
The Senate passed its
updated bill on Tuesday
and sent it back to the House, which then needed to approve the same text to move it forward.

Much like in the Senate, House GOP leaders then had to work with conflicting factions of the conference to get enough lawmakers on board, particularly those concerned about Medicaid changes and conservative fiscal hawks who wanted to see more savings.
Republican holdouts in the House slowly got on board with the bill throughout Wednesday evening into Thursday.
Before the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that many previously opposed lawmakers had needed a ""reasonable"" amount of time to understand the Senate changes.
""I gave them the space to do it,"" he said, adding, ""The president helped answer some questions. We got Cabinet secretaries involved and experts in all the fields, and they got their questions answered.""

""[There] won't be any vote until we get satisfied,"" Norman said, before ultimately announcing he would support the bill later that evening. ""What I want to know is ... what actions we can put in place, that the president and his team can do, to make sure we have our questions answered.""
However, when reporters asked Johnson Thursday morning about any potential executive actions the president pledged to take to address concerns from conservatives, the speaker said he wasn't clear on any details. ""I know there was a lot of talk about how the bill would be implemented and what role the executive would have.""
""I don't think they exacted a lot of specific commitments or concessions or anything like that,"" he said of GOP members after the vote. ""It was just more an understanding [of] how that would interact.""
Johnson said he was planning to move another reconciliation package in the fall and in the early spring to address items that were not included in this package.

Asked whether he was trying to win over Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who opposed the procedural measure to bring up the bill, Johnson said, ""I've certainly tried to encourage him to get to a yes.""
The speaker admitted he had not gotten any sleep. ""Can you tell?"" he joked to reporters.
Final passage of the legislation came just one day ahead of a self-imposed GOP deadline to have the bill on the president's desk by July 4. Trump has been a constant presence throughout the process for Republicans, pressuring members to strike a deal and
threatening to support
primary challengers to
lawmakers who oppose it

At the kickoff of a yearlong campaign to celebrate America's 250th birthday, President Trump spent over an hour in Iowa celebrating his administration's accomplishments and his vision for the country.
Trump's remarks at the
""America250""
event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds came hours after the Republican-led Congress passed a
sweeping reconciliation package
that extends tax cuts enacted during his first term and makes steep cuts to social safety programs such as Medicaid and federal food aid.
""There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' to make America great again,"" Trump said.

History
America has a major birthday coming up — here's what to expect for the big 2-5-0
The America250 initiative is a nonpartisan, taxpayer-funded effort to commemorate a quarter millennium of the country's independence, culminating in the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026.
""Today we kick off our year-long 250th birthday party for America,"" United States Chief of Protocol Monica Crowley told the crowd ahead of Trump's remarks. ""This majestic celebration is about our exceptional history and the start of a new era of American greatness. Today we launch the next 250 years of American freedom, strength, dynamism, leadership, and pride.""
The program ultimately was more
typical of Trump's bombastic campaign rallies
. In a speech earlier in the night, Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann told Democrats opposed to the reconciliation bill to ""go pound sand.""
""Do not cede an inch when you're talking to your neighbors and friends,"" he added to the sea of supporters at the fair grounds.
Throughout the night, Trump also bashed those he disagreed with, ranging from the ""fake news"" and ""radical left bureaucrats"" to immigrants who are in the country illegally and some bankers he called ""shylocks"" — a term that the Anti-Defamation League has called an anti-Semitic stereotype. Then-Vice President
Joe Biden apologized
after using the term in 2014. Asked later Thursday night about his use of the term, Trump said, ""I've never heard it that way. To me, a 'shylock' is somebody that's a money lender at high rates — I've never heard it that way.""

A half hour into his remarks, Trump said July 4, 2026, would be ""a birthday party the likes of which you have never seen before,"" including events he
floated on the campaign trail
like a ""Great American State Fair.""
""The Great American State Fair will bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country, culminating in a giant patriotic festival next summer on the National Mall, featuring exhibits from all 50 states,"" Trump said.
Trump also announced the ""Patriot Games,"" a televised competition for high school athletes from across the country that will be led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump said.
He also proposed having an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight hosted on the grounds of the White House as part of the event.

President Trump says the U.S. has made a trade deal with Vietnam as part of his push to renegotiate tariffs with dozens of different countries around the world. It comes as the president's self-imposed deadline for those tariff negotiations is just a week away.
In
a social media post
, Trump said tariffs will now be 20% on goods from Vietnam and 40% on goods shipped through Vietnam. While Trump wrote that Vietnam will pay these tariffs, that is untrue. U.S. businesses importing goods from Vietnam will be paying the taxes to the government.
He said that in return, Vietnam would ""give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade,"" meaning that ""we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff."" He specifically cited SUVs as a product that would be exported in larger numbers to Vietnam. However, the White House has not released further details on this agreement.
Sponsor Message
The announcement came after Trump in April proposed a steep 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports — one of the highest rates applied to any country — saying he would address the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam. He has since temporarily set the tariff at 10%, which Trump called a ""pause,"" pending tariff negotiations between officials in Hanoi and Washington.
Trade relations between the U.S. and Vietnam have grown remarkably since the U.S. lifted its economic embargo on Vietnam in 1994. The two countries normalized diplomatic ties in 1995.
In 2001, the U.S. and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement, granting Vietnam most-favored-nation status and paving the way for its ascension into the World Trade Organization.
Over the next two decades, trade between the two nations skyrocketed,
reaching $149.6 billion by 2024
— about a 50-fold increase since 2002.
In 2023, the U.S. and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a ""comprehensive strategic partnership,"" strengthening ties that have been crucial to Vietnam's economic growth. The U.S. is now Vietnam's
largest export market
, accounting for nearly a third of its total exports. According to the
Commerce Department
, Vietnam's main exports to the U.S. include machinery, appliances, clothing and shoes.
However, with significant trade imbalance favoring Vietnam raising concerns in Washington — the U.S. trade deficit reached
over $123.5 billion in 2024
and
$39.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025
, U.S. officials have been pressing Vietnam to address non-trade barriers, combat fraud, and curb illegal transshipments. They also urge Vietnam to further open its market to U.S. goods and services.

The Vietnamese government set an ambitious 8% growth target for 2025, but a recent report supported by the Asian Development Bank suggested that U.S. reciprocal tariffs of 20% or higher could hinder achieving this goal."

President Trump put essentially his entire domestic agenda in one bill.
It would significantly cut clean energy incentives, Medicaid and food assistance programs — and double down on tax cuts, immigration enforcement and national defense.
Despite opposition from Democrats, and divides within the Republican Party, it passed through Congress.
How did that happen? And what does it mean for American taxpayers? NPR correspondents explain.

President Trump's
signature domestic policy bill
is headed to his desk, marking a historic federal investment in immigration enforcement.
The House
cleared
Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" on Thursday — meeting the president's self-imposed deadline of July 4.
The massive package sets aside
about $170 billion
to support the Trump's administration's border and immigration goals, which includes detaining and deporting a record number of people from the U.S.
Politics
Here's what's inside the GOP megabill
Earlier this week, White House border czar Tom Homan told reporters that Congress needed to pass the bill in order for the federal government to buy more detention beds.
""The more beds that we have, the more bad guys we arrest,"" he added.
Both critics and supporters say carrying out Trump's immigration agenda will depend on how effectively federal agencies implement and deploy those resources.
""It will absolutely supercharge immigration enforcement over time, but it's not gonna happen overnight,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""So how quickly the Trump administration is able to use this money to fuel its mass deportations campaign is a real question.""
Sponsor Message
Immigration enforcement
The final bill allocates $45 billion for immigration detention centers, as well as about $30 billion to hire more ICE personnel, for transportation costs, and to maintain ICE facilities, among other spending. It comes as detention centers operate
beyond their capacity
.
The American Immigration Council
estimates
that the new funding could expand detention capacity to ""at least 116,000 beds.""
Immigration
In recorded calls, reports of overcrowding and lack of food at ICE detention centers
Bush-Joseph said the money may help reduce overcrowding and improve staffing. But she is also concerned that it will lead to a broader use of detention.
After migrants are identified as removable from the U.S., they may be released ahead of their court dates, held in
local jails
, or placed in ICE detention. The Trump administration
has made plans
to end the policy known as ""catch and release"" — which allows people to be released from detention while they await an immigration court hearing — but ending it would require more detention space.
Bush-Joseph said that individuals in immigration custody tend to face greater challenges with communication, obtaining counsel, interpretation, and understanding their rights.
""The nature of immigration detention in and of itself is that it's harder for people to win relief in immigration court,"" she said.
Border security
The bill provides roughly $46.5 billion to complete Trump's border wall. It also sets aside $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities and $10 billion for border security initiatives more broadly.
Sponsor Message
About $13.5 billion is put toward reimbursing states and local governments engaging in immigration and border-related enforcement.
Some critics have questioned the need for more border security funding, given that the number of people crossing the southern border has fallen to
its lowest level in decades
— with slightly over 6,000 apprehensions in June, according to
preliminary figures
released by the Department of Homeland Security.
But Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports restricting immigration, argued that its better to invest in border infrastructure now than wait until another surge in crossings.
"" If we wait until 250,000 people arrive per month, it's going to be too late,"" he added, referring to the
peak of monthly arrests
hit under former President Joe Biden.
Immigrati
on fees
Republicans also sought to make the immigration process more expensive with increased or new fees.
Among the biggest changes to the immigration provisions from the House to the Senate version is the reduction in the minimum fee required to apply for asylum:
from $1,000 in the initial House version
to $100 in the final bill. The adjustment came after the Senate parliamentarian determined that the higher fee did not meet the rules needed to qualify for a simple majority vote.
Immigration
GOP's budget package proposes to cut benefits and raise fees for legal immigrants
Arthur said adjudicating each application can be costly. "" It's not unreasonable to expect them to pay at least $100 for their asylum application if only to cover a portion — and a very small portion of that — of the processing and adjudication fees,"" he added, speaking about migrants seeking asylum to stay in the U.S.
But Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, argued that the new or increased fees will put an ""unaffordable price tag on due process"" for many immigrants. According to Altman, among the biggest increases is the fee to appeal an immigration judge's decision: from the current $110 to $900.
Sponsor Message
""Many of these fees are going to become barriers or obstacles to people making their way through the very basic requirements of the immigration court system,"" she said.
Safety net programs
The initial House bill
already stripped health coverage
under Affordable Care Act marketplaces and Medicare for a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylees, and those with other humanitarian protections. It also restricted eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The final version maintains those cuts while extending similar limitations to federal funding for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to Shelby Gonzales, the vice president for immigration policy at the left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
"" The truth is that already a lot of people are barred from insurance just based off of not having the right kind of immigration status,"" Gonzales said. ""The changes that are made in this law go even further.""
Policy-ish
5 ways Trump's megabill will limit health care access
Those remaining eligible for these public benefits are green card holders who have completed the five-year waiting period, certain Cubans and Haitians, and individuals residing in the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association, which includes people from Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands.
Arthur from the Center for Immigration Studies argued that the U.S. already faces a challenge supporting a large number of low-income citizens — even without the additional strain on the country's social safety nets.
"" It is reasonable to expect those who come to this country to be able to provide for themselves,"" he said. Arthur added that states who want to provide benefits should be able to fund them.
Gonzales said her most immediate concern is the limits to SNAP benefits, adding that she is worried whether food banks can meet potential increased demand in the future. ""I don't think that they have the capacity to help people in huge numbers that might be losing access to food immediately,"" she said.
Sponsor Message
The bill's changes to the Child Tax Credit will also have an impact on immigrant families. Currently, only the child needs to have a Social Security number to qualify for the benefit. While the House initially proposed requiring both parents to have a Social Security number, the final version requires just one parent to do so.
"" The child tax credit will be effectively cut off for kids with two undocumented parents,"" said Tara Watson,  director of the Center for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution. ""That's a significant amount of money that assists with the wellbeing of citizen children and it will be gone.""
Immigration courts
Over $3 billion is allocated to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities. That includes the hiring of more immigration judges to address the growing case backlog, which was at
nearly 4 million cases
as of April, the latest data available.
Bush-Joseph from the Migration Policy Institute said the immigration court system is vastly underfunded compared to ICE and CBP, therefore the additional funding is promising. But she noted that the bill caps the number of judges to 800, which may fall short of what's needed.
Immigration
ICE's novel strategy allows for more arrests from inside immigration courts
Bush-Joseph pointed to a 2023 analysis by the
Congressional Research Service
, which estimated that over 1,300 judges would be necessary to eliminate the backlog over the next several years.
""To my mind, immigration courts will likely continue to struggle to keep up because the backlog is so huge,"" she added."

At the heart of the legislation is an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts. It also includes new spending on defense and immigration enforcement, and lifts the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion.
To pay for that, the bill cuts spending across a range of programs, most notably Medicaid — which provides health care for low-income, elderly and disabled Americans.

Republicans say they are targeting waste, fraud and abuse in the program. And Democrats, who all voted against the bill, had warned that the legislation contains major cuts to the social safety net, including food aid and insurance coverage for millions of Americans.
However, early estimates suggest around
12 million people
could lose coverage and that's one of the main reasons why negotiations on this bill were so contentious in both chambers.
""There will be immediate impacts as a result of this big ugly betrayal,"" Democratic Party chair Ken Martin told NPR.
Even with its passage, the fight over this bill is far from over.
Before the vote, Martin told
All Things Considered
host Juana Summers that Democrats plan to make this legislation the centerpiece of their push to win back control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Juana Summers:
I just want to start by asking you to peel back the curtain for us. What's the strategy here?
Ken Martin:
Well, look, let me just start with how devastating this bill has looked. You know, these cowardly Republicans, most of them who haven't met with their constituents, they refuse to meet with their constituents, and who try to pass this bill in the middle of the night. Thank God that Hakeem Jeffries gave his record-breaking speech today to make these Republicans actually vote in broad daylight.

At the end of the day, these Republicans betrayed their constituents. They put their fealty to Donald Trump and the Republican Party and his billionaire friends ahead of the constituents that they were elected by. And this betrayal is immense, right?
Interview highlights
An Alabama food bank braces for big increase in demand if SNAP cuts take effect
So for me, we're going to hang this vote around the neck of every single Republican who decided to sell their constituents out to help billionaires.
Summers:
Explain to me how so, though, because I've covered politics for a long time and historically Republicans have been pretty good at selling a message. For example, this is a bill that is widely known as the Big Beautiful Bill, even though — I will note — this is not something that will be beautiful for all Americans. So, what can members of your party tell their constituents that is as concise and compelling as that that can explain to people the message that you have?
Martin:
It's not beautiful. Isn't that beautiful about this bill? At the end of the day, this is the most unpopular piece of legislation in the last half century.
The majority of Americans — not majority Democrats — majority of Americans do not favor this bill. It is a gift for the Democratic Party because let me tell you, many people who left our party, they bought this snake oil salesman's message that he was going to actually improve their lives and strengthen communities, he hasn't delivered at all on any of that. And that gives us an opportunity, as a Democratic Party, if we're willing to take it — and I'll tell you what, we are willing to take that opportunity — to actually expand our coalition and bring many of those people back into the conversation and back into our party.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin speaks after winning the vote at the Democratic National Committee Winter Meeting in February.

Summers:
I've got to ask you about a bit of polling. According to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, the approval rating for congressional Democrats is at just 27%. That is down from 39% last February. How do you and your fellow Democrats make the case to the American public that they can trust you and that they can support the party?
Sponsor Message
Martin:
Well, I think it's a fair point. We have to earn the trust of voters back. And there's no doubt that there were a number of people who've left our party because they don't feel like we're fighting for them anymore.
And, you know, actually, last year there was some research that showed surprisingly — it should have been the canary in the coal mine — that for the first time in American history, the majority of Americans believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the middle class, the working class and the poor. And the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites.
Well, boy, this vote today actually proves that it's just the opposite. And that is what I'm talking about. For us to earn the trust back of these voters, we have to stand up and fight for them again. And we have to give them a sense of what our economic agenda is and what it would mean if they put Democrats back in power versus this Republican administration who's made it clear that they could give a damn about working people in this country and they're certainly not going to fight for them.
So I do think, you know, look, we've got work to do. There's no doubt about it. But I've always said this: when you hit rock bottom, guess what? There's only one direction to go and it's up. And that's what we're doing.
Politics
How Trump's big beautiful bill aims to 'supercharge' immigration enforcement
And certainly this bill is going to supercharge that because people are going to be pissed off around this country.
Summers:
We just saw Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, win the New York mayoral primary over the establishment candidate Andrew Cuomo. And I'll just note that Mamdani did not have the Democratic Party support. Does that win make you reconsider your strategy when it comes to backing establishment Democrats in the midterms?
Martin:
No. Listen, my strategy has always been to support whoever our Democratic nominee is, right? And Mamdani is our democratic nominee and we will support him. You know, look, we're a big tent party. We have conservative Democrats. We have centrists, we have progressives and we have leftists.

And I believe you win elections through addition, not subtraction. You win elections by actually bringing people into your coalition, not pushing them out.
And so for me, there are a lot of lessons to learn from his campaign. One is how disciplined he was on the message. He stayed focused on what people care about, which was affordability. And then also his online and offline presence and how he actually met voters, where they were at with a message that was resonant. That's the key to winning, for sure.
And you know what? We are happy as a Democratic Party to support our nominees wherever they live. No matter what part of the ideological spectrum they're on, we're going to support them. Because guess what? At the end of the day, in my opinion, you know, any Democrat, regardless of their flavor, is better than a Republican any day of the week."

Moderates in the House were opposed to the Senate's changes to the bill, which include steeper cuts to Medicaid.
At the same time, fiscal hawks said the cuts aren't deep enough. Some of the holdouts wanted material changes to the bill, but Republican leaders argued it was too late in the process for those adjustments. NPR's Claudia Grisales tells

Several fiscal forecasters predict that the big tax cut and spending bill will likely increase the federal debt by
trillions of dollars over the next decade. They expect the bill to have
minimal impact on boosting the economy
. The plan would extend tax cuts from the first Trump administration and introduce additional tax breaks, reducing government revenues. Additionally, the measure increases government spending on defense and immigration enforcement.
🎧
The plan isn't the direction the government should be going in
, and ""every fiscal warning sign is blinking red right now,"" Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tells NPR's Scott Horsley. Most of the individual tax cuts will benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, while families earning less than $55,000 a year will, on average, be worse off. Horsley says this is because any tax savings that these families receive will be
overshadowed by cuts to programs
such as Medicaid and food stamps.

The mustache seems to be making a comeback. To be clear, we're not talking about a beard — just the 'stache. Celebrities like Timothée Chalamet, Donald Glover and Benson Boone have all been spotted embracing this trend. Matthew Scalf, founder of the grooming brand Beard Sorcery, observed that the ""mustache renaissance"" began about a year ago. Historically, mustaches have been associated with the military, police and firefighters. The form of facial hair has not been widely accepted in corporate America in recent decades.

The GOP's massive bill would add trillions of dollars to the country's debt
At the heart of the legislation is an extension of President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. It would also end taxes on tips and overtime, at least temporarily, which was one of the big campaign promises Trump made.
The bill also includes new spending on defense and immigration enforcement, and it lifts the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion.
To pay for that, the bill cuts spending across a range of programs,
most notably Medicaid
, the joint federal and state program that provides health care for roughly 70 million low-income, elderly and disabled Americans.

GOP governors stay silent amid plans to slash Medicaid spending in their states
Early estimates suggest around 11 million people could lose coverage under the GOP bill, and that's one of the main reasons why negotiations around this bill were so contentious in both chambers.
Overall, the sprawling GOP bill — clocking in at nearly 1,000 pages — represents a dramatic realignment of the federal government's role in American life, shifting resources from the social safety net and investments in clean energy, and reorienting them to finance trillions of dollars in new spending on tax cuts, immigration enforcement and national defense.

Up next, lawmakers will debate the bill on the floor. Once that's done, they can proceed to a final vote.
That's a process that could take several more hours, but assuming Republicans have the votes, they will have made good on their promises to have this bill to President Trump's desk by Friday.
Even with its likely passage, the fight over this bill is far from over. Democrats have made clear they plan to make this legislation the centerpiece of their push to win back control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections."

The last time a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump moved to slash Medicaid spending, in 2017, a key political force stood in their way: GOP governors.
Now, as Congress steamrolls toward passing historic Medicaid cuts of about
$1 trillion over 10 years
through Trump's tax and spending legislation, red state governors are saying little publicly about what it does to health care — even as they face reductions that will punch multibillion-dollar
holes in their states' budgets
.
Medicaid, a program jointly run by states and the federal government, covers more than 70 million low-income or disabled people, including nearly half of the nation's children. Republicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say
don't deserve government assistance
, and they have long sought to scale it back.

Policy-ish
5 ways Trump's tax bill will limit health care access
Some of the biggest health cuts in the legislation Trump calls the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" are achieved through new policies that would reduce enrollment by imposing more paperwork demands on enrollees, including a requirement that many prove they're working. Those policies would affect only states that expanded Medicaid to more low-income people under the Affordable Care Act.
Nineteen of those states are
led by Republican governors
. Their silence on the bill's health measures is giving political cover to GOP lawmakers from their states as they seek to cut Medicaid coverage for millions of people who gained it within the last decade.
KFF Health News contacted all 19 governors for comment on the legislation's Medicaid cuts. Only six responded. Most said they backed imposing a work requirement on adult Medicaid enrollees.
""Implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults is a good and necessary reform so that Medicaid is being used for temporary assistance and not a permanent entitlement,"" said Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.
""Governor Rhoden supports workforce participation as a requirement of Medicaid expansion eligibility,"" said Josie Harms, a spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, adding that congressional lawmakers have the governor's support: ""South Dakota has an excellent federal delegation, and Governor Rhoden trusts them to fight for South Dakota's priorities while delivering on President Trump's promises.""
Sponsor Message
In a sign of how the political winds have changed, none of the governors said anything about the legislation's crackdown on another significant cut, to
provider taxes
— a tool that nearly all of their states use to help pay their share of Medicaid and gain additional funds from the federal government. That change is expected to cost states billions.
A bipartisan issue no longer
In contrast to the radio silence from GOP governors, Democratic governors have campaigned against the megabill for weeks.
Interview highlights
Maine can't afford to lose federal funding, governor says
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro posted
on the social media platform X
that Trump and congressional Republicans were misleading Americans by saying they were cutting only waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.
""They're rushing to kick hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians off their healthcare — and lying about it,"" he posted. ""The damage this will do here in Pennsylvania and across America is staggering and will be felt for years to come.""
In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul on July 1 charged that Trump's legislation would devastate hospitals and could lead to more than 34,000 job cuts in her state.
""The collective impact of the GOP reconciliation bill in Washington, D.C., could force hospitals to curtail critically needed services such as maternity care and psychiatric treatment, not to mention to downsize operations, and even close entirely,"" she said
in a statement
.
In 2017, the chorus was bipartisan, as Republican governors in
Ohio
,
Nevada
, and
Massachusetts
spoke out against cutting Medicaid. Trump's bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and roll back its Medicaid expansion narrowly failed in the Senate.
""It's been surprising that red-state governors, particularly those in Medicaid expansion states, haven't spoken out against Medicaid cuts,"" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. ""Republican governors were a potent political force in the failed 2017 effort to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion.""
Interview highlights
Republicans' big bill could hit rural hospitals hard
What's changed since 2017, policy experts say, is that there are fewer moderate Republican governors, and GOP state executives who advocated for Medicaid expansion over a decade ago are no longer in office.
Additionally, seven of the then-red states that expanded Medicaid
did so via ballot initiative
, mostly over opposition from their governors.
In fact, the Medicaid work requirement is backed by many Republican governors, even if it means less federal Medicaid money and leads to fewer people covered.
Several states, including Arkansas and Ohio, have already passed state laws to implement a requirement that adults enrolled under the ACA's Medicaid expansion work, volunteer, go to school, or participate in job training. Most states have yet to bring work requirement programs to fruition because they are waiting for federal government approval.

Charles ""Chip"" Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group of investor-owned hospitals, said that while fewer governors have engaged publicly in trying to block Medicaid cuts under the bill, federal lawmakers are hearing from legislators in their states.
A political dilemma for Republican governors is that, unlike in 2017, the bill before Congress is not legislation aimed expressly at repealing Obamacare. Its scope is broader than health care, and would extend many of Trump's tax cuts, and direct billions in new spending toward border security, immigration enforcement, and the military, while also cutting health care spending.
""It's like playing multidimensional chess rather than focusing on one issue,"" Kahn said.
Larry Jacobs
, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said some Republican governors may have expressed concerns privately to their states' GOP senators but are not speaking out publicly for fear of drawing Trump's wrath.
""Why are they being cagey? Trump and not wanting to be 'Liz Cheney'd,'"" Jacobs said, referring to the Republican former Wyoming lawmaker whom Trump helped oust after she served as vice chair of an inquiry into his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
Walking political tightropes
The political peril Republican lawmakers face in publicly challenging Trump remains explicit. On June 29, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he would not run for reelection after he voiced concerns about the bill and the president threatened to back a primary challenger. Tillis was one of three GOP senators to vote against it on July 1, though it still narrowly passed.
In addition to the work requirement, the biggest Medicaid cuts in the bill stem from its restrictions on provider taxes — levies that states impose on hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care institutions to help increase their federal reimbursement. Much of the additional money is then returned to the health care providers in the form of higher payments for their Medicaid patients.

The Senate bill would limit the money states could raise — a move that would mean billions in funding cuts to states and their hospitals.
The states with Republican governors that expanded Medicaid are Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Utah.
One of the governors who expressed concerns about repealing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in 2017 was Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Democrat at the time.
In a
June 2017 letter
to West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, Justice wrote: ""Since so many of our people count on Medicaid, any cut to Medicaid would destroy families in West Virginia."" He added that ""the consequences would be beyond catastrophic.""
On July 1, Justice — elected to the Senate as a Republican last year — voted for Trump's megabill, including its Medicaid cuts.
""The Senator believes this bill strikes a good balance between protecting the most vulnerable and those who rely on the program while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure the program is run efficiently for those deserving,"" William O'Grady, a Justice spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday.

with those who say the media — including his own paper — is too liberal.
What seemed possible — but hard to believe — before President Trump took office once more has now taken shape: A number of corporate and individual owners of media that promise to hold power to account have instead bowed to it. So too have the chiefs of two major social media platforms — among the richest people on the planet.

The $16 million settlement over an interview CBS'
60 Minutes
conducted last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris smooths the path for Redstone and Paramount to secure the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to sell the company to Skydance Media, a deal bankrolled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally. The FCC must sign off on the transfer of the broadcast licenses for CBS' local TV stations for the deal to go through.
Trump's legal team had alleged that CBS's decision last fall to air different parts of Harris's answer to a question about the Israel/Hamas conflict on
60 Minutes
and
Face The Nation
constituted election interference. They said it had inflicted emotional harm on Trump. His pick to lead the FCC had initiated a formal review of complaints against CBS.
""With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,"" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team said on Wednesday. ""CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.""
Outside legal experts, by and large, see it differently. They almost uniformly call Trump's claims spurious, saying CBS's editorial decisions are protected by the First Amendment.

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a frequent Trump defender, publicly
argued that the lawsuit was likely unfounded
.
""The decision to settle a case with no legal merit obviously comes squarely from the corporate suite, not from anybody at CBS News,"" former CBS News president Andrew Heyward tells NPR. ""To me, the critical issue is whether
60 Minutes
can hold onto its tradition of fierce editorial integrity under new management.""
Indeed, CBS chief and Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks focused on the company's larger financial interests at a Paramount shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. ""Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,"" Cheeks said. He noted that a legal settlement lets a company move on with its business.
Emotions ran high at a
60 Minutes
staff meeting Wednesday morning. A person who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal company matters says people were more doleful than angry. The payout came as no surprise; corporate executives had telegraphed that there would certainly be a settlement. Some were relieved that Paramount had declined to issue what they saw as an unwarranted apology.
Trump speaks about free speech but lawsuits serve as warning signal
Paramount and CBS are following what is — by now — a well worn path of corporate deference to Trump.
The owners of the
Washington Post
and the
L.A. Times
— the billionaire entrepreneurs Jeff Bezos and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong — separately killed editorials drafted to endorse Harris shortly before the election and completely overhauled their editorial pages to be less likely to criticize Trump.

Last year, as he campaigned for the White House, Trump promised to

In recent days, by contrast, Trump has

suggested it might prosecute CNN
for reporting on an app that would alert users to activity by immigration authorities. CNN noted that any iPhone user can download it through the App Store.
Meanwhile, the

""A cold wind just blew through every newsroom""
Free speech and press advocates blanketed Paramount with condemnation Wednesday for settling the
60 Minutes
case.
""A cold wind just blew through every newsroom this morning,"" said Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. ""Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media's editor-in-chief.""

Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Paramount would have prevailed in any suit. He said the settlement marked a sad day for press freedoms.
""This was a frivolous lawsuit and the payment being described as a 'settlement' bears no relation to Paramount's actual legal exposure in the case, which was negligible,"" Jaffer said. ""Now Trump's presidential library will be a permanent monument to Paramount's surrender, a continual reminder of its failure to defend freedoms that are essential to our democracy.""
Some legal scholars have told NPR they consider the settlement a form of extortion, relying upon the president's powers and influence over the executive branch.
Several Democratic lawmakers have called for hearings or investigations. ""Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval,""
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden posted on X
. ""When Democrats retake power, I'll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.""
Convictions on bribery charges can be hard to secure and are often tossed out, says Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. CBS simply had more to lose than Trump should the case have gone to court, he says, arguing that the legal discovery process could've turned up evidence that the media company would rather keep hidden.
""Every organization has someone within it that has said something that looks terrible to its reputation,"" he tells NPR.
Yet there is no reason to believe that legal settlements guarantee future peace with a president who has long identified ""fake news"" as the enemy.

Lower taxes, little boost to growth
The bill would extend tax cuts from the first Trump administration and add additional tax breaks, reducing government revenues. The measure also increases government spending on defense and immigration enforcement. While it makes cuts to spending on Medicaid and food assistance, those cuts offset only a fraction of the bill's total cost.
At the same time, the measure is expected to do little to boost economic growth. CBO has not yet estimated the economic effects of the Senate bill. But an earlier House version was found to provide only modest economic gains, which were
dwarfed by the cost of higher interest payments

MILWAUKEE – Supporters of reproductive rights are celebrating a win in Wisconsin. After years of litigation over an
1849 law
that conservatives argue criminalizes abortions in the state, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the law does not ban abortion.
This means abortions can continue in the state.
It marks the end of a saga that began when
Roe v. Wade
was overturned in 2022, ending federal constitutional protections for abortion. While it was clear in some states that abortion would be banned, and in others that abortion would be protected, Wisconsin found itself in a legal gray area.
Sponsor Message
Because of the 1849 law, abortion providers in the state stopped offering the procedure. But Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued at the time, challenging the law, and the issue of how to interpret the 1849 statute has been in the courts since June of 2022.
In December 2023, the trial court found that the law doesn't outlaw abortions, that it is actually a feticide law that makes it illegal to attack and kill a woman's child without her consent. Since that ruling, people have been able to get abortions in Wisconsin, up to 20 weeks or beyond if necessary to save the life or health of the mother, according to a
law passed in the 1980s
.
The ruling, the dissent and what's next
On Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled—along ideological lines—that the law does not ban abortion. The court has a 4-3 liberal majority, which it maintained after some
highly publicized and heavily funded elections
for its open seats in 2023 and 2025.
In its ruling, the majority found that the Wisconsin Legislature functionally repealed the 1849 law by later laws regulating abortion. ""We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion,"" writes the majority.
Sponsor Message
In a dissenting opinion, conservative Justice Annette Ziegler writes, ""the majority picks and chooses which abortion statutes remain in force,"" and calls the opinion ""a jaw-dropping exercise of judicial will.""
Last year,
the court accepted
a separate case from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin that argued the statute is a ban and that it's unconstitutional. Wednesday, though, justices dismissed that case because they could only get to the constitutional question if they ruled the law does ban abortion.
Planned Parenthood had posited that the 176-year-old law conflicts with the provisions in the state constitution establishing a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as well as equal protection. So, the constitutional question goes unresolved, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
""And so, I think there will be continued conversations about what constitutional protections we have in Wisconsin,"" says Godar. She says that could be future court cases or constitutional amendment ballot questions.
Right now, citizens
don't have a way
to initiate constitutional amendments via ballot measures in Wisconsin; only the Legislature can do that. Wisconsin currently has a divided government, made up of a GOP-controlled Legislature and a Democratic governor. So, it's unlikely that the legislature will initiate any ballot questions to establish constitutional protections for abortion within the next year or, conversely, that the Democratic governor would sign any additional bans into law.
But all this could change after the 2026 midterm elections in Wisconsin, when many state legislative seats and the governor's office will be up for grabs."

Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" aims to reduce federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplaces
by approximately $930 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This latest estimate represents a cut of $100 billion more than what the House voted to cut in May. If passed, the bill would
reverse many of the health coverage gains
achieved during the Biden and Obama administrations, which made it easier for millions of people to access health care and lowered the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.
🎧
There are 26 million Americans without health insurance right now. That number is expected to go up
by a third because of this bill, according to the CBO. The primary way the bill will separate people from their insurance is increased paperwork, says Julie Rovner with KFF Health News. The bill would require people to prove their eligibility every six months instead of once a year. The process would be
more than filling out a form

DOGE is collaborating with ATF on around 50 regulatory changes, many of which aim to relax gun regulations, according to people NPR's Meg Anderson spoke with who are familiar with the matter. One proposed change would extend the validity of background checks for firearm purchases from 30 days to 60 days. Another change would permit gun dealers to
destroy records after 20 years

The Department of Justice has also proposed cuts to over 500 investigators.
The ATF is the only agency in the U.S. with the ability to trace guns involved in crimes, a service police use all the time. The agency maintains a database of markings found on bullets and casings after they have been fired. ""It's like a gun's fingerprint,"" Anderson says. Brandon del Pozo, who used to be the police chief in Burlington, Vt., says cuts to the agency are
at odds with the Trump administration's claim
that they're tough on crime.

The current Trump administration is focused on reforming air traffic control following a recent spate of technical outages and staffing shortages. This is not the first time the administration has attempted such reforms. The Trump administration tried to privatize U.S. air traffic control in 2017, but the effort never took off. This time, the goal is a multibillion-dollar investment in the Federal Aviation Administration. Talks of privatization seem to be on hold. Aviation industry groups are rallying behind Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's plan to modernize the system by upgrading outdated equipment and ramping up hiring. However, some FAA critics argue that the best way to
improve the nation's air traffic control system
is to remove it from direct government oversight altogether.

✈️ In 1996, Canada privatized its air travel system, making it easier to acquire new technology that enhanced air travel without enduring the lengthy public procurement process.
✈️ Canada shifted from funding air traffic control mainly through tax revenue to implementing fees based on flight weight and distance.
✈️ Opponents of privatization argue that it hasn't always been successful. They cite a recent shortage of air traffic controllers in Canada and a 2023 report from the International Civil Aviation Organization, which downgraded Canada's flight safety rating.

Maine Governor Janet Mills is warning that her state cannot afford the large cuts in federal assistance included in the massive tax and spending legislation currently awaiting a final vote in the House of Representatives. More than
30,000 people would lose their health care
coverage and up to four rural hospitals could close in the first year alone, according to Maine's Department of Health and Human Services.
""The cost of health care in rural states is enormous to begin with. We can't be shifting the cost to the states. We can't be shifting the cost to working families,"" the Democratic governor told
Morning Edition
.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill, which contains much of President Trump's domestic agenda, would cut federal spending on Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces by about
$1 trillion
over the next decade.
""We've removed a lot of people from Medicaid already and put them onto the Affordable Care Act, which is also cut in this bill,"" Mills said. ""These are working people who need health care.""
The bill, which
the Senate passed Tuesday
, could leave nearly 12 million people across the country uninsured, threatening Americans' physical, mental and financial health.
Mills spoke with NPR's Leila Fadel about how the Senate's bill would affect Maine's healthcare system and residents overall.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Leila Fadel
: So after the Senate approved this legislation yesterday, you said this would hurt Maine residents. What are your concerns specifically?
Gov. Janet Mills
: Well, first of all, Medicaid is a serious, serious problem, the cuts to Medicaid. And it'll result in about $4.5 billion in cuts to Medicaid in Maine alone over the next decade. About 400,000 people, [among] our 1.4 million people in Maine right now, use Medicaid for their health insurance. That includes about 190,000 children. And in addition, about 175,000 people rely on food stamps or SNAP for nutrition. The cost of administering the program, the SNAP program being shifted on to the states will result in about a $60 million a year cost to the state of Maine. Maine is not a wealthy state. We're a rural state. People describe this bill as beautiful. I don't see anything beautiful about it. There's nothing pretty about cutting food to hungry children. Nothing pretty about preventing people from getting to their doctor when they have a healthcare problem or preventing the doctor from being paid. Nothing pretty about threatening rural hospitals or driving up the cost of energy, especially in a state that relies on oil for heat now and depends so much on the fluctuating prices of petroleum products.

Fadel
: Governor, what are you going to do if this bill does pass? I mean, how will the state move forward? And what are you going to do for Maine residents?
Mills
: We just passed the state budget barely a week ago, and we'll be looking again at revenues and costs and trying to adjust changes here and there. I've been against raising taxes. I remain against raising taxes on Maine people, which makes it even more difficult to raise taxes because of the costs on low income and middle income people in Maine. We've removed a lot of people from Medicaid already and put them onto the Affordable Care Act, which is also cut in this bill. So to put people on the Affordable Care Act in the marketplace and then say, 'Well, we're going to take that away as well,' these are working people who need health care. The cost of health care in rural states is enormous to begin with. We can't be shifting the cost to the states. We can't be shifting the cost to working families.
Fadel
: This legislation is going to the House. Do you have anything that you would say to Republican House members as they take this up?
Mills
: Think carefully. What is the emergency about passing this bill? What is the emergency? Take your time. Read all 900 and something pages and think about the costs in your states. Every child who's going hungry. Every person who needs health care to save their lives, to maintain their families.

The tax and spending legislation the House voted to send to President Donald Trump's desk on Thursday, enacting much of his domestic agenda, cuts federal health spending by about $1 trillion over a decade in ways that will jeopardize the physical and financial health of tens of millions of Americans.
The bill,
passed in both the House and the Senate
without a single Democratic vote, is expected to reverse many of the health coverage gains of the Biden and Obama administrations. Their policies made it easier for millions of people to access health care and reduced the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows, though Republicans say the trade-off was far higher costs borne by taxpayers and increased fraud.
Sponsor Message
Under the legislation Trump is expected to sign on Friday, Independence Day, reductions in federal support for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause nearly 12 million more people to be without insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.
Politics
House Republicans pass Trump's megabill, sending the package to his desk to be signed
That in turn is expected to undermine the finances of hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers — which will have to absorb more of the cost of treating uninsured people. Some may reduce services and employees or close altogether.
Here are five ways the GOP's plan will affect health care access.
1. Many people will have to work to stay on Medicaid
The deepest cuts to health care spending come from a proposed Medicaid work requirement, which is expected to end coverage for millions of enrollees who do not meet new employment or reporting standards.
In 40 states and Washington, D.C., all of which have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child. The new requirement will start as early as January 2027.
The bill's requirement doesn't apply to people in the 10 largely GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to nondisabled adults.
Sponsor Message
Health researchers say the policy will have little impact on employment. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees who don't receive disability benefits already work or are looking for work, or are unable to do so because
they have a disability
, attend school, or care for a family member,
according to KFF
, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
State experiments
with work requirements have been plagued with administrative issues, such as eligible enrollees' losing coverage over paperwork problems, and budget overruns. Georgia's work requirement, which officially launched in July 2023, has cost more than $90 million, with
only $26 million
of that spent on health benefits, according to the
Georgia Budget & Policy Institute
, a nonpartisan research organization.
""The hidden costs are astronomical,"" said Chima Ndumele, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
2. Less cash means less care in rural communities
Belt-tightening that targets states could translate into fewer health services, medical professionals, and even hospitals, especially in rural communities.
The GOP's plan curtails a practice, known as
provider taxes
, that nearly every state has used for decades to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers and to private managed-care companies.
States often use the federal money generated through the taxes to pay the institutions more than Medicaid would otherwise pay. Medicaid generally pays lower fees for care than Medicare, the program for people over 65 and some with disabilities, and private insurance. But thanks to provider taxes, some hospitals are paid more under Medicaid than Medicare,
according to the Commonwealth Fund
, a health research nonprofit.
Hospitals and nursing homes say they use these extra Medicaid dollars to expand or add new services and improve care for all patients.
Rural hospitals typically operate on thin profit margins and rely on payments from Medicaid taxes to sustain them. Researchers from the
Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research
who examined the original House version of the bill concluded it would push more than 300 rural hospitals — many of them in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma —
toward service reductions or closure
.
Sponsor Message
Republicans in the Senate tacked a $50 billion fund onto the legislation to cushion the blow to rural hospitals. The money will be distributed starting in 2027 and continue for five years.
3. ACA coverage will become harder to get and keep
For those with Obamacare plans, the new legislation will make it harder to enroll and to retain their coverage.
ACA marketplace policyholders will be required to update their income, immigration status, and other information each year, rather than be allowed to automatically reenroll — something more than 10 million people did this year. They'll also have less time to enroll; the bill shortens the annual open enrollment period by about a month.
People applying for coverage outside that period — for instance because they lose a job or other insurance or need to add a newborn or spouse to an existing policy — will have to wait for all their documents to be processed before receiving government subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Today, they get up to 90 days of premium help during the application process, which can take weeks.
Republican lawmakers and some conservative policy think tanks, including
the Paragon Health Institute
, say the changes are needed to reduce fraudulent enrollments, while opponents say they represent Trump's
best effort to undo Obamacare
.
Interview highlights
Republicans' big bill could hit rural hospitals hard
The legislation also does not call for an extension of more generous premium subsidies put in place during the covid pandemic. If Congress doesn't act, those enhanced subsidies will expire at year's end, resulting in premiums rising by
an average of 75%
next year, according to KFF.
4. Those on Medicaid will pay more to see the doctor
Many Medicaid enrollees can expect to pay more out-of-pocket for appointments.
Trump's legislation requires states that have expanded Medicaid to charge enrollees up to $35 for some services if their incomes are between the federal poverty level (this year, $15,650 for an individual) and 138% of that amount ($21,597).
Sponsor Message
Medicaid enrollees often don't pay anything when seeking medical services because studies have shown charging even small copayments prompts low-income people to forgo needed care. In recent years, some states have added charges under $10 for certain services.

The paperwork trap: A sneaky way to cut Medicaid in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'?
The policy won't apply to people seeking primary care, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. The bill allows states to enact even higher cost sharing for enrollees who seek emergency room care for non-emergencies. But if Medicaid patients fail to pay, hospitals and other providers could be left to foot the bill.
5. Some immigrants will lose access to subsidized ACA plans
The GOP plan could cause at least hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are lawfully present — including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking, and refugees — to lose their ACA marketplace coverage by cutting off the subsidies that make premiums affordable. The restriction won't apply to green-card holders.
Because the immigrants who will lose subsidies under the legislation tend to be younger than the overall U.S. population, their exit would leave an older, sicker, and costlier population of marketplace enrollees, further pushing up marketplace premiums, according to marketplace directors in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and health analysts.
Taking health care access away from immigrants living in the country legally ""will do irreparable harm to individuals we have promised to protect and impose unnecessary costs on local systems already under strain,"" John Slocum, executive director of Refugee Council USA, an advocacy group, said
in a statement
.
The bill reflects the Trump administration's restrictive approach to immigration. But because it ran afoul of Senate rules, the legislation doesn't include a proposal that would have reduced federal Medicaid payments to states such as California that use their own money to cover immigrants without legal status.

Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, said it has agreed to pay $16 million to President Trump's foundation for his future presidential library to settle a lawsuit he filed over the editing of a
60 Minutes
interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during last fall's elections.
The settlement includes Paramount paying Trump's legal fees, according to a statement from the company late Tuesday. The settlement does not include any statement of apology or regret, Paramount said.
As part of the settlement, Paramount said,
60 Minutes
will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future after they've aired. They may be redacted due to legal or national security concerns. The suit also settled all claims by Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, who had joined Trump's suit. The White House referred comment to the president's legal team.

Trump declared victory in holding ""the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,"" according to a spokesperson for his legal team, who said Paramount and CBS had no choice but to settle. ""President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.""
Legal observers spanning the ideological spectrum say Trump's lawsuit — which had sought $20 billion in damages — spuriously alleges election interference over the kind of discretionary editorial choices that routinely confront broadcast journalists.
As a result, the settlement represents a bitter blow to CBS News and its crown jewel
60 Minutes
— not for what it broadcast or reported, but for a deal struck by corporate executives many layers above them.
Trump's lawsuit centers on a
60 Minutes
interview conducted last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, shown above. It used different portions of Harris' answer to the same question for two different shows.

Last fall, CBS News used one part of Harris's answer to a question on Gaza from
60 Minutes
correspondent Bill Whitaker for
Face The Nation
, and another for the lengthier treatment on
60 Minutes
itself.
In the case, filed before a
Trump-appointed federal judge
in Eastern Texas, Trump's legal team argued that CBS engaged in ""unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive and substantial news distortion.""
""Am I supposed to take that seriously?"" asks University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias, who specializes in First Amendment issues. ""I do not understand how suits that are arguably frivolous or meritless — that have very little substance and wouldn't amount to large judgment if you went to trial — are then settled for millions of dollars.""
""It's laughable and it's an affront to the First Amendment,"" Northwestern University law professor Heidi Kitrosser says of Trump's case. ""His concern first and foremost is to intimidate the press.""
Paramount's settlement appears to be directly modeled on that reached with Trump by ABC News's parent company, the Walt Disney Co.
Disney paid $15 million to a future foundation and museum for Trump to settle a lawsuit over incorrect remarks by anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump had been found liable for rape in a civil suit. He hadn't; A New York City jury rejected that count but found Trump liable for sexual assault. Disney's attorneys feared they could lose if the case went to trial, though media lawyers said it was likely to prevail on the merits.
Meta paid $25 million to resolve a suit from Trump over his removal from Facebook after the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol, though it had an even stronger case than Disney, outside lawyers say.

The litigation filed by Trump tangled up any such approval by the FCC, however.
Indeed, FCC Chairperson Carr gave ballast to Trump's suit by requesting CBS share raw footage and full transcripts of the
60 Minutes
interview with Harris, which was one of Trump's demands. Carr did so after reviving a complaint against CBS that had been filed by a conservative public interest group. Carr's Democratic predecessor had dismissed the complaint in her final days in office.
CBS had previously refused to release the raw materials, citing the importance of maintaining journalistic independence from governmental interference.
Shortly after Carr's request, CBS announced it was legally required to comply, though the network has challenged the agency's requests and demands in the past. (One such appeal, over a complaint filed by the late former President Jimmy Carter, reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981.)
Sponsor Message
After receiving the unedited material, the FCC publicly posted
links
to it and CBS swiftly followed suit. The network also published a statement that said the material showed there had been no bias in how they presented the Harris interview. Carr said he would keep a review open for six weeks to allow the public to weigh in.
Carr told Fox News
that day that an investigation was warranted under ""news distortion"" concerns because CBS broadcast different answers on two different programs to the same question. ""The [FCC]
policy
says you can't, you know, swap answers out to make it look like somebody said something entirely different,"" Carr said. ""Clearly, the words of the answers were very different.""
The transcripts
appear to show that CBS editors pulled from slightly different points in the same response, with Harris speaking vaguely as she attempted to sidestep controversy over the incendiary issue of the Israel-Hamas.
After the transcript's release,
Trump denounced CBS
. ""CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable 'NEWS' show should be immediately terminated,"" Trump posted online. (CBS as a network doesn't hold a license; the local stations on which it is broadcast do.)
""That's not a veiled threat — it's an open threat,"" Tobias says of Trump's remarks. ""Look at what's already poured in — millions into his coffers [from media companies].""
Tobias puts the settlement in the context of the FCC's new agenda under Carr, with agency reviews of programming on ABC, CBS and NBC. Carr has also ordered a formal investigation into whether corporate underwriting spots aired by NPR and PBS have evolved into full-fledged commercials and says he believes Congress should eliminate funding for the public broadcasters. (The two networks say they take pains to abide by federal law and the FCC's own guidance.)
Sponsor Message
Some of the network's stars had openly lobbied Paramount not to settle. Others were
anticipating it with a sense of mourning
. Tobias suggested they didn't stand a chance.
Carr ""is leveraging Trump's power and the whole force of the government to come down on major aspects of the press,"" Tobias said. ""Who's going to stand up to Trump? Nobody. Certainly not the Congress — not the Senate or the House. So you've got the press.
""But now the press, you're seeing them operating on their own interests. And they're settling these cases that are not very strong on the merits."""

Politics
The Trump administration is making an unprecedented reach for data held by states
The data transfer, which happened last month, was
first reported
by The Associated Press. Top Health and Human Services officials directed the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) to share data with DHS from California, Illinois, Washington and Washington, DC, about millions of their Medicaid recipients, according to the AP's report.
Those jurisdictions allow some low-income immigrants, including some without legal status, who do not qualify for Medicaid to access state-funded health programs.
States routinely must share extensive data about Medicaid enrollees with CMS, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, immigration status and healthcare information — but say that data is supposed to stay confidential.
The suit, which was filed in federal court in San Francisco, asks the court to stop HHS from sharing Medicaid data with any other federal agency and to stop DHS, any other federal agency, or the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from using the data for immigration enforcement or ""population surveillance.""
It also asks the court to order the ""impoundment, disgorgement, and destruction of all copies of any Medicaid data containing personally identifiable, protected health information that has already been unlawfully disclosed to DHS and DOGE.""
Bonta and almost all the other state attorneys general bringing the federal lawsuit are Democrats.
Sponsor Message
DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin sent NPR a statement that said, in part: ""CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""
The Department of Health and Human Services said it does not comment on litigation, but last month, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the data transfer was legal, and that CMS is ""aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants.""
""This oversight effort — supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS — is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse,"" Nixon said in the same statement. ""We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars — we are restoring credibility to one of America's most vital programs.""
All states, however, receive
emergency Medicaid funds
that reimburse hospitals for emergency care regardless of someone's immigration status.

Senate Republicans have passed President Trump's signature domestic policy bill, setting the stage for a final vote in the House on legislation that would cut trillions of dollars in taxes while scaling back spending on Medicaid, food assistance and clean energy programs.
The final vote was 51-50 with Vice President JD Vance breaking a tie. Three Republicans broke ranks and voted against the bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Kentucky's Rand Paul. The bill now heads to the House, where some GOP lawmakers are already signaling major objections.
Tuesday's vote capped weeks of contentious negotiations between fiscal hawks who wanted deeper spending cuts, and a handful of other Republicans who expressed concerns that cuts in the bill could have deep impacts across the country.
Sponsor Message
The bill would extend the tax cuts that were passed by Republicans in 2017, preventing a potential hike in rates at the end of this year when the current provisions are set to expire. Republicans are offsetting some of those costs with cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, along with major changes to Medicaid, the joint federal and state program that provides health care for roughly 70 million low-income, elderly and disabled Americans. Early estimates suggest around 11 million people could lose coverage under the GOP bill.
Facing growing pressure from the White House, Republicans were able to strike a delicate balance and pass the bill with just days to go before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The vote once again highlighted President Trump's ability to unify fractious wings inside the GOP.
""With this legislation, we're fulfilling the mandate we were entrusted with last November and setting our country and the American people up to be safer, stronger and more prosperous,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., after the vote.

Even as Republicans celebrated the vote, the GOP megabill still faces a steep climb before reaching the president's desk.
To get the bill through, Republicans turned to a special budget tool known as reconciliation. By doing so, the party was able to sidestep a Democratic filibuster and pass the bill with a simple majority. But the legislation also needed to fit strict Senate rules that require all of the elements to be primarily related to the budget and spending. That meant many GOP priorities were stripped from the legislation before the final vote.

Republicans in the House and Senate must agree on identical versions of the plan before sending the legislation to Trump for his signature. The Senate version may not satisfy the many divided factions of the narrow GOP majority in the House.
Politics
Here's what's in the GOP megabill
Getting the Senate bill through the House without further changes will be a crucial test for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.. For weeks, Johnson has pleaded with the Senate to keep any changes to a minimum. He was able to squeak the bill through by a single vote the first time — relying heavily on President Trump to win over last-minute holdouts. With Republicans clinging to a razor-thin majority in the House, their margin for error will be small.
Following the Senate vote, Johnson said
in a statement
that the House would work quickly to pass the bill by the Fourth of July.
""The American people gave us a clear mandate, and after four years of Democrat failure, we intend to deliver without delay,"" Johnson said.
Tax cuts paired with cuts to the social safety net
The broad outlines of
the Senate measure
largely mirror the version of the bill that House Republicans passed in May. Both would spend trillions to extend the 2017 tax cuts while steering more money to the military and immigration enforcement. Both would also make good on several of Trump's campaign pledges, including no taxes on overtime or tips, albeit on a temporary basis.
But the two chambers are split
over how to pay for that spending
, with some House Republicans flatly calling changes made by the Senate a non-starter for them.
One of the biggest areas targeted for savings is Medicaid. House Republicans sought to trim the bill's price tag, in part, through new work requirements for childless adults without disabilities. Seeking additional savings, the Senate plan expands those requirements to the parents of older children.
Policy-ish
Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
The Senate also moved to rein in what are known as provider taxes — a tax states have used to secure more federal matching dollars for Medicaid. To alleviate lawmakers who said the change risked the collapse of many
rural hospitals
, the Senate ultimately included a new $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals. That program would begin in 2026 and funds would be spread out over five years.
Following the vote, Collins said she was unable to support the legislation even after leaders included more money to support rural hospitals.

""I strongly support extending the tax relief for families and small businesses,"" Collins wrote in a statement. ""My vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.""
Paul said he could have supported the package had it not included a provision to lift the nation's borrowing authority by $5 trillion. And he derided changes that were made to win the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Those included a reprieve for her state from new work requirements to qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which benefits more than 40 million low-income Americans.

""The bill got more expensive to get her vote,"" Paul said as he left the Senate floor. ""There had to be a purchasing of her vote.""
Murkowski told reporters the vote was ""agonizing,"" saying she ""struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country.""
""I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first. We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,"" Murkowski said. ""My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.""
The sweeping bill —
clocking in at nearly 1,000 pages
— would bring changes across a wide array of policy areas. In addition to spending cuts for SNAP, the bill commits billions to border security, overhauls the federal student loan program, and ends the $7,500 credit for buying an electric car passed as part of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.
Deficit tensions
Another tension point is how much to lift the debt ceiling. The House approved a $4 trillion hike — a figure that in itself was a tough sell for fiscal hawks concerned about government spending. The Senate opted for $5 trillion. Lifting the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending. Rather, it allows the government to pay for programs Congress has already authorized. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Congress that without action, the U.S. will be at risk of a potentially catastrophic default on its debt as early as August.
Sponsor Message
The nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office found
that the Senate bill would add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Extending the 2017 tax cuts made up the bulk of the cost but other changes have added to the bottom line.
Politics

The Senate changed how the bill handles a deduction for state and local taxes that was pivotal to securing the votes of GOP lawmakers in the House from blue states with high taxes. The SALT cap, as the deduction is known, went from $10,000 to $40,000 in the House for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. The Senate plan keeps that new threshold in place, but the provision would expire after 2028.
The bill also targets other clean energy credits passed as part of the IRA. The Senate agreed to roll back credits for wind and solar — cuts that were included in the House package to help win over fiscal hawks from the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. That plan would halt
roughly $522 billion in investments
, many of which are based in red states.
Senate Democrats have been united in opposing the bill, and attempted to delay the eventual vote by requesting the full bill be read on the Senate floor over the weekend. They dominated proceedings on Monday with a stream of proposed amendments that Republicans ultimately struck down.
In a press conference after the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., railed against the bill and said Democrats would continue to highlight what they see as negative consequences brought by it.
""The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,"" Schumer said. ""Americans will pay the price for this perfidy for generations."""

President Trump visited Florida on Tuesday to tour what's been dubbed ""
Alligator Alcatraz
,"" a controversial migrant detention center in the Everglades that officials say is poised to start filling its bed in a matter of hours.
The president was joined by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state emergency management officials as he toured the makeshift facility, which the state put together within days of receiving federal approval last week.
""I thought this was so professional, so well done,"" Trump said after touring the center, which features rows of fenced-in bunk beds and a razor-wire perimeter. ""It's really government working together.""

The facility is situated within the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, an isolated, 39-square mile airstrip located within the wetlands of the Big Cypress National Preserve, next to Everglades National Park.
Politics
Florida is moving ahead with 'Alligator Alcatraz,' despite widespread pushback
The site's nickname — coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — references its proximity to the predators of the marshy Everglades, from pythons to alligators to mosquitoes.
""What'll happen is you'll bring people in there, they ain't going anywhere once they're there unless you want them to go somewhere, because, good luck getting to civilization,"" DeSantis said at an unrelated
news conference
on Monday. ""So the security is amazing — natural and otherwise.""
The first arrivals are expected this week
Speaking
to reporters
before departing for Florida, Trump described the facility as ""an East Coast"" version of the infamous island prison off the San Francisco coast. When asked if the idea was for detainees to get eaten by alligators if they try to escape,
Trump replied
, ""I guess that's the concept.""
""Snakes are fast but alligators — we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator. Don't run in a straight line, run like this,"" he said, waving his hands in a zigzag. ""You know what, your chances go up about one percent.""
Immigration
Private prisons and local jails are ramping up as ICE detention exceeds capacity
The airstrip's roughly 11,000-foot runway has largely been used for training purposes, but officials say it will soon accommodate deportation flights. DeSantis has repeatedly said the state will deputize National Guard judge advocates to
serve as immigration judges
in order to expedite the removal of migrants — both from the facility and the country.
""So you'll be able to bring people in, they'll get processed, they have an order of removal, then they can be queued and the federal government can fly — right on the runway, right there, you literally drive them 2,000 feet, put them on a plane and then they're gone,"" said DeSantis.

Uthmeier said last week that the facility will mostly consist of tents and trailers, with no brick-and-mortar construction required. He said it was on track to open with some 5,000 beds — about half of its overall capacity — by early July, which officials confirmed during Tuesday's tour.

DeSantis said the first arrivals are expected sometime on Wednesday, after a security sweep. Noem said that could be within 24 hours.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is overseeing the Trump administration's
crackdown on illegal immigration
, including by ramping up
deportations and arrests
and setting a daily quota of 3,000 arrests.
The administration wants to
more than double
its existing number of beds for detaining migrants nationwide to 100,000 and has framed Florida's newest detention facility as a key part of that effort.
Immigration
Private prisons and local jails are ramping up as ICE detention exceeds capacity
""We are working on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations,"" DHS
said last week
. ""Alligator Alcatraz will expand facilities and bed space in just days, thanks to our partnership with Florida.""
During Tuesday's tour, Trump, DeSantis and Noem urged the leaders of other states to come up with their own models for detention centers.
""Florida was unique in what they presented to us, and I would ask every other governor to do the exact same thing,"" Noem told reporters on the tarmac.
When asked by Trump about the possibility of expanding the Everglades site, DeSantis demurred but said the state is looking into other facilities in different areas. He has
suggested Camp Blanding
, a training center for Florida National Guard units in the north-central city of Starke.
""Because this is an important part of Florida, we're using the existing footprint of this airport,"" DeSantis said, referring to Dade-Collier. ""All the beds, the medical galley, everything is on the concrete, we're not using any of the other stuff. Now, as you'll see, there's a lot of concrete.""
The Everglades facility will cost Florida some $450 million to run for one year, according to DHS, though much of that will be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). While the airstrip is owned by Miami-Dade County, where officials have viewed the plan with skepticism, DeSantis is using his emergency authority to proceed on a tight schedule.

Florida Republicans have embraced the project, with the state GOP now selling ""Alligator Alcatraz""-
branded T-shirts
, trucker hats and beer koozies on its website. Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson — on whose show Uthmeier announced the facility had been greenlit — posted a
series of videos
from the center on Tuesday morning, including one wearing an ""Alligator Alcatraz"" hat that he said was ""provided to us by the state of Florida.""
After the tour, Trump joined Noem, DeSantis, Uthmeier and other leaders for a wide-ranging
roundtable discussion
about immigration enforcement in Florida and beyond. Midway through the conversation, the people in the room learned that the Senate had just
passed Trump's sweeping policy bill
, prompting a round of applause.
""You know I'm waiting, listening to these wonderful words — and they are music to my ears — but I'm also wondering how we're doing, because I know this is prime time,"" Trump said, referring to the Senate vote. ""It shows that I care about you, because I'm here and I probably should be there.""
The project has many critics

Just as the facility's setup was swift, so too was backlash to it.
In recent days, hundreds of people representing a broad coalition of concerned Floridians — from conservationists to Indigenous communities — have lined the nearby highway to
protest the site's development
.
Such tactics have worked in the past: The Dade-Collier facility was envisioned as the largest airport in the world before protests and an environmental review convinced the government to stop work on the site in 1970.
Immigration
In recorded calls, reports of overcrowding and lack of food at ICE detention centers
This time around, opponents include immigration advocates who are worried about a
lack of oversight
at the facility, as well as the welfare of detainees being held in tents in Florida's notorious summer humidity and what forecasters predict will be another
above-average hurricane season
. Officials visiting on Tuesday made sure to emphasize to reporters that the facility has air conditioning.
State officials have said they are drafting natural disaster plans for the facility, with a spokesperson for DeSantis
telling the Associated Press
that it will be evacuated ""if a tropical cyclone with windspeeds higher than the temporary facility's wind rating is forecasted to impact the area.""

The project is also opposed by
Native American groups
, who consider the area their sacred ancestral homeland. Its site is immediately adjacent to the Tamiami Trail, which hosts 19 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, Miccosukee Chairman Talbert Cypress
said in a statement
.

""Rather than Miccosukee homelands being an uninhabited wasteland for alligators and pythons, as some have suggested, the Big Cypress is the Tribe's traditional homelands,"" Cypress said. ""The landscape has protected the Miccosukee and Seminole people for generations.""
He said the state would save taxpayer money by moving the facility to a different location ""with more existing infrastructure and less environmental and cultural impacts to the Big Cypress and Tribal lands.""
Environmentalists are also concerned about the impact of the facility on the Everglades' fragile ecosystem. The 1.5 million acres of wetlands are home to a variety of
endangered species
— including the Florida panther, West Indian manatee and American Crocodile — and a vital water source for the region.

""The hasty transformation of the Site into a mass detention facility, which includes the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts,""

He tried hard to keep affordability the focal point of his campaign, but encountered attempts from others to misrepresent his identity. Unfounded claims were made suggesting he would promote Islamic law, while some accused him of supporting terrorism and being antisemitic. For the most part, New Yorkers didn't fall for these attacks. Mamdani is now the presumptive Democratic candidate after receiving the most votes in the primary last week.

Living Better is a
special series
about what it takes to stay healthy in America.
Cancer survivors and advocates say that all too often, even well-intentioned people get the fundamentals wrong when they share their bad news. What is worse is when people disappear without a word. The phenomenon is so common that many cancer patients call it ""cancer ghosting."" This often occurs because people may be unsure of how to respond. But the silence can be even more painful than the treatments themselves, several cancer survivors tell NPR. Here's
advice for what to do and say
— and what not to say — when a loved one faces cancer.
❤️ It can be scary for you as a loved one of someone with cancer, but remember, they are facing a bigger fear. Connection and presence are important, even if you don't know what to say; just being there makes a difference.
❤️ If it feels awkward, acknowledge the tension and ask whether the patient wants to talk about it. If they do, just listen and allow them space to vent.
❤️ When conveying understanding, avoid sharing your own stories or unsolicited advice, as it may overlook the person's unique experience. Each cancer journey is different, and others' stories can be irrelevant or trigger fears.
❤️ People who survive cancer and no longer have treatment should still receive continued support. This could just mean remembering to honor how cancer has left its mark.

4 things to know about Zohran Mamdani, presumptive Democratic nominee for NYC mayor
It's Been a Minute
Zohran Mamdani's primary win and the Democrats' Tea Party moment
""There are a lot of concerns based on a caricature of myself,"" Mamdani said on
Morning Edition
. ""I don't blame New Yorkers for having that caricature because they've had to deal with more than $30 million of spending that paints me in that manner — that smears and slanders me, that artificially lengthens the color and the length of my beard, that calls me a monster.""
But for the most part New Yorkers didn't fall for it. Mamdani is now the Democratic candidate after getting the most votes in the primary last week. He is one step closer to becoming mayor of the nation's largest city.
On Monday, NPR's Leila Fadel sat down with Mamdani in New York City to discuss the lessons his victory holds for his party and how he plans to implement his policies if he becomes mayor despite skepticism about their feasibility.
Mamdani clarified remarks he made on NBC News'
Meet the Press
about billionaires, saying, ""I think the better question is whether working people have the right to exist, because what we've seen in this city is that more and more working people are being pushed out.""
Asked about his proposals, like free public transit and expanded childcare, he acknowledged that many of his ideas would need state-level support, particularly from Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has voiced skepticism and so far has not endorsed him. But he remained optimistic, citing his success in launching New York City's first fare-free bus pilot as evidence that progressive reform is achievable.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Leila Fadel:
Let's talk about your policies, because one of the criticisms that your detractors have is that it sounds great to have free childcare and free buses and groceries that you can afford. But a lot of what you're promising is out of the mayor's hand. It's something that will have to happen at the state level. It will have to happen with other actors. So how, how can you actually fulfill any of these promises?
Zohran Mamdani:
Any mayor that has an ambition that meets the scale of the crisis of the people that they're seeking to represent will have to work with Albany. And the reason that I put forward this agenda is not only because it's urgent, but because it's feasible. I say that to you as an assembly member who won the first fare free bus pilot in New York City, who saw that in making buses free. It wasn't simply about economic relief. It's also about public safety, the fact that assaults on bus drivers went down by 38.9% through this pilot, the fact that we actually saw an increase in riders who had previously been driving a car or taking a taxi, reducing congestion around those same routes. These are the reasons why we pursue this agenda.
Fadel:
The way that you say you're going to pay for these programs is by increasing the corporate taxes on corporations and then also an income tax on anybody who makes over a million dollars, right?
Mamdani:
The top 1% of New Yorkers.
Fadel:
So again, that's a non-starter for Gov. Kathy Hochul, she said that. So how are you going to pay for it?
Mamdani
: I've appreciated my conversations with the governor, and one thing that I really appreciate about our current governor, Kathy Hochul, is she is laser focused on affordability. And what we've seen is that these policies I'm speaking to you about, they are not just policies that people are voting for, incidentally, while they're voting for me, they're voting for this platform.
Sponsor Message
Fadel:
But again, what makes you confident about the coalition building when you're hearing the governor say it's a non-starter, she hasn't also endorsed you yet, as these other leaders within your party have not done?
Mamdani
: The experience that I've had. Over this campaign, there was a time when many of the ideas we were putting forward were considered to be distinct to our campaign, and yet, as we built it, more and more candidates started to embrace those same policies, and I am confident of seeing that happen across the political spectrum. Even Andrew Cuomo, in his own transportation plan, said that he wanted to explore making buses free. That was a recognition of the popularity of that as a proposal.
Fadel:
You made some waves this weekend when you said that you didn't believe that billionaires had the right to exist. What does that mean?
Mamdani:
I was speaking about the stark nature of income inequality in this city and in this country, and ultimately, I think the better question is whether working people have the right to exist, because what we've seen in this city is that more and more working people are being pushed out. The vision that I'm speaking about, it's a vision that I want everyone to enjoy and benefit from, including billionaires. Though my taxes that I'm proposing are ones that would be on the top 1% of New Yorkers, on the most profitable corporations, it's not taxes that will detract from their life. It's, in fact, taxes that will benefit everyone across the city, including those who are being taxed. And ultimately, this is not an interest in taxation in and of itself. It's an interest in finding revenue to pay for something that will transform life in the city.
Fadel:
So you weren't proposing that your policies would ultimately lead to a New York with no billionaires?
Sponsor Message
Mamdani:
No, that's not what I was proposing.
Fadel:
You are going to have what looks like a tough race in November. You already have people like billionaire Bill Ackman saying he'll give hundreds of millions of dollars to anybody who runs against you.
Mamdani:
I think he also said some nice things, nice things about me as well.
Fadel
: What else did he say?
Mamdani:
I think he said that I was smart, which I appreciated. Thank you, Bill.
Fadel:
Well, okay, but he also doesn't want you to be mayor of New York City, you know, and there are other corporations, wealthy New Yorkers, who feel the same way, and there are some people who fear your candidacy. You have support among some Jewish voters, and you have some Jewish voters who are extremely skeptical of you and afraid of your candidacy.
Mamdani
: My job is to lead this entire city. My job is to address those very concerns that New Yorkers may have, be it for whatever basis. My commitment is now to have meetings with New Yorkers who may be concerned. Maybe it's, you know, a business leader who is worried about the impact of my tax proposals, and I get to share the fact that these are proposals that will make it easier for them to attract and retain talent. If I can speak with a Jewish New Yorker who's concerned about the issue of antisemitism, and I can share the fact that this is a real crisis that we have to tackle, and one that I'm committed to doing so through increased funding for actually preventing hate crimes across the city, and make it clear time and again that my commitment is to protect Jewish New Yorkers and that I will live up to that commitment through my actions. And that's what these next many months are about.

Fadel:
You know, the thing that was very clear in the weeks before and the days after the primary was this barrage of racist, anti-Muslim attacks on you, equating you to a terrorist, saying you're a danger to the safety of Americans, especially Jewish Americans. I'm going to repeat some of the attacks, not because I think they're okay to say, but I want listeners to understand what's being said. And it's not just from the right wing and Republicans in office. It's also from other influential figures. Deborah Messing of
Will & Grace
posted online that you sided with terrorists and you celebrated 9/11. You were nine when that happened. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace posted a picture of you in your Eid outfit and wrote, ""After 9/11 we said, ""Never Forget."" I think we sadly have forgotten."" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles called you ""little Muhammad,"" and said you need to be deported, and is calling for your denaturalization. Were you prepared for this level of bigotry?
Mamdani:
It's unsurprising, and yet it's still deeply saddening. As many Muslims in this country know, to exist in public life is to have to deal with this kind of slander at a different scale, and it's part of why so many have thought that the safest place to live is in the shadows, and so much of my hope for this campaign was to bring the margins of our city into the mainstream. It's been very difficult to see just how much of this hatred has been normalized. And as you've said, it's, it's not just Republican Congress people. It's an actress from a show that I used to watch as a kid. I think that ultimately my responsibility is to show that our vision for this city, it's a vision that is universal. It's a vision that wants to recognize the belonging of each and every New Yorker, and it's in stark contrast to this exclusionary vision that we see from so many, one that seeks to distract people from an inability to take care of working people by designating the enemies as the other. One of the most difficult parts of this, however, have been that the threats that have been made on my life and on people that I love are ones that fundamentally transform how you can live.

It has. The fact that I now have to have security at all times. It's a different way of engaging with the world. But my responsibility is to showcase that this is but a drop in the bucket of how people actually feel in the city. Just a few days after I received a number of death threats and someone who said that he was going to blow up my car, which was news to me, because I don't own a car. I walked the length of Manhattan to speak to New Yorkers. And I did it because I think, though, the way that we defeat this bigotry is by showcasing just how small of a minority it actually represents.

Ahead of the July Fourth holiday and the country's 249th birthday, three-quarters of Americans say democracy is under serious threat, according to a new
NPR/PBS News/Marist poll
.
Nearly three-quarters also see politically motivated violence as a major problem.
The findings come at a time of great political volatility. In the midst of Donald Trump's second term as president, the country is polarized and sharply divided.
The U.S. is grappling with what it means to be American, who is essential to its story, who belongs, who doesn't and which direction the country should take — all while Americans are expressing very little faith in its political leadership, the survey finds.
Sponsor Message
Marist interviewed 1,381 adults from June 23-25. Respondents were reached via text message or online. The survey was available in both English and Spanish. The poll has a +/- 2.9 percentage point margin of error. The survey was weighted to reflect the demographic breakdowns in the U.S. Census.
Who thinks democracy is threatened
The overwhelming majority of respondents — 76% — said democracy is under serious threat. That's statistically unchanged from April of this year, but down significantly from August of 2023 when 87% overall said there was a serious threat to democracy.
Republicans are largely responsible for the decline, going from 88% saying there was a serious threat — while Democrat Joe Biden was president — to 57% now.
In this most recent poll, 89% of Democrats, 80% of independents and 57% of Republicans said there is a serious threat to the future of democracy. Respondents did not specify what they see as constituting that threat, and Democrats and Republicans likely have very different reasons for saying so.
Loading...
There was no meaningful difference by race, income or education, but those who most see democracy under serious threat were people who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris and white women, regardless of college education — 85% of white women with degrees and 81% of white women without them said the threat was serious, compared to 70% of white men with degrees and 67% of white men without them.
Politically motivated violence is seen as a major problem
Here, too, a significant majority — 73% — said they see politically motivated violence as a major problem.
While there was little difference by political party, there was some division by race and age. While majorities of Latinos, Black voters and younger voters saw politically motivated violence as a major problem, they were more than 10 points less likely to say so than whites and older voters.
Here, again white women with college degrees (83%) were the most likely to say it's a major problem, followed closely by those 60 and older (81%), as well as white women without degrees (80%).

There is little confidence in political leadership
Whether it's Trump, congressional Republicans or congressional Democrats, respondents do not have much confidence in their elected leaders.
Overall, Trump gets just a 43% job approval. His handling of immigration mirrors his overall rating, and people have even less faith in his handling of foreign policy (41%) or the economy (39%).
Loading...
As for the parties themselves, just 35% approve of the job congressional Republicans are doing — and that's the highest Marist has recorded ever since it started asking the question back in 2011.
As for congressional Democrats, just 27% approve of them, their lowest score in seven years.
Loading...
The glaring difference between the parties' ratings is how people in their own parties see them. While 73% of Republicans approve of congressional Republicans, just 44% of Democrats approve of congressional Democrats.
Notably, there's no generational divide. In fact, the older Democrats were in this survey, the more likely they were to disapprove of congressional Democrats.
Who belongs in the country is a major political divide
Almost two-thirds said America's openness to people from all over the world is essential to what the country is.
But Republicans diverged sharply from Democrats and independents on that question. While 85% of Democrats and 68% of independents agreed, 62% of Republicans said if America is too open to people from all over the world, it risks losing its identity as a nation.
Trump's deportation policies mirrored his overall approval on immigration — 43% said the administration's policies are making the country safer, 33% said less safe and another quarter said they're not really having an impact either way.
When digging into who should stay and who should go, there was broad support for deporting people convicted of crimes who are in the country without authorization, less support for deporting agricultural and food industry workers, and a divide over those in the country on expired student visas.
Sponsor Message
Republicans, though, are heavily in favor of deporting all of them.
Loading...
As for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a majority (54%) think it has gone too far in enforcing immigration laws. About a quarter said ICE is doing about right, while almost 1 in 5 think it hasn't gone far enough.
People continue to say Trump should follow court orders
More than 4 in 5 said presidents should follow court orders even if he or she doesn't like them. That includes 70% of Republicans, but only 22% of Republicans strongly agree with that statement.
Loading...
There's a split over Iran attacks
Respondents split down the middle — 50%-50% — on whether they agree or disagree with the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Three-quarters of Democrats and 54% of independents disagree, while a sweeping majority of Republicans (84%) agree.
The attacks are very polarizing, likely reflecting views of Trump himself: 53% of Republicans strongly agree with the attacks, while 46% of Democrats strongly disagree. (As noted above, Trump has a 43% approval rating — another 43% strongly disapprove of the job he's doing.)
Forty-eight percent of respondents said Iran is a major threat to the security of the United States, as opposed to 39% who said it posed a minor threat. Just 13% said it is no threat at all.
Gen Z and millennials were most likely to say it represents no threat — roughly 1 in 5 said so.
Three-quarters of people said they're concerned about retaliation. Trump voters were the most likely to say they were not concerned about it (38%)."

Fewer Americans cast their ballots by mail during last year's election, while more voters embraced casting their ballots in-person before Election Day.
New data
from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission found that the 2020 presidential election remains a high-water mark for vote by mail usage in a nationwide election.

Trump still would have won in 2024 even if everyone had turned out to vote, Pew finds
According to a national survey of local and state election officials that the agency conducts after every major election, ""mail voting comprised 30.3% of the turnout for the 2024 election,"" which is a decrease compared to the 2020 election when mail ballots comprised 43% of turnout.
The commission, however, noted that the share of mail voting last year is still ""larger than the percentage of the electorate that voted by mail in pre-pandemic elections."" Turnout has also stayed above pre-pandemic levels. During the 2024 election, nearly 65% of the citizen voting age population participated in the general election, which is the second highest turnout in the last five presidential elections.

Mail voting popularity drop-off
The EAC found that in-person voting started to see ""a resurgence"" in 2022, while mail voting saw a corresponding decrease that year.

""For the 2024 general election, more than two thirds of voters cast their ballots in person either before or on Election Day,"" the report found. ""Approximately three in 10 voters cast their ballots by mail.""

The Trump administration is building a national citizenship data system
Commissioner Donald Palmer told NPR that voters often ""have their own preferences"" when it comes to methods of casting a ballot, but that can change over time if other methods become available to them.
""And so election officials, what we take away from that is that we need to be prepared and be ready to facilitate different forms of voting,"" he said.
There are several reasons experts expected that vote by mail was unlikely to be as popular as it was during the pandemic. For one, many states expanded vote by mail for health and safety reasons during the 2020 election, but some reverted back to more limited programs ahead of the 2024 election.
Also, in the wake of the 2020 election, President Trump and Republican lawmakers across the country also
spread misinformation
aimed at discrediting voting by mail, which eventually led to a slew of laws being passed in recent years that create new limits on this method of voting.
Republicans did embrace mail-in ballots in the 2024 election, encouraging voters to ""Bank Your Vote"" by getting it in early, in contrast to previous elections.

Despite efforts to limit voting by mail in some states, overall access to the ballot for most Americans
has expanded
since 2020.
More voters opted to vote early in-person
One of the methods of voting that has become more popular in recent years is in-person early voting. During the last presidential election, more than 158 million ballots were cast and counted and the majority of those ballots were cast in-person — 35.2% of those votes were cast before Election Day and 37.4% on Election Day.
According to the EAC, ""for the first time, all states reported offering some form of in-person voting before Election Day.""
Palmer said he thinks early in-person voting is one of the most convenient voting options for many Americans.

Trump's DOJ makes its most sweeping demand for election data yet
""It really is convenient to take one of those days in the lead up to Election Day and vote early, particularly if you have to travel or if you've got to be away or you're working,"" he said. ""So I actually think it's just time to take advantage of the convenient voting.""
Palmer said there were a lot of bright spots in the report — particularly on the security side of voting. At this point, about 98% of voting jurisdictions have a paper trail for their voting systems. Also, the nationwide rejection rate of mail ballots was only 1.2%, which has remained consistently low in recent years.

One area where there is still work to be done, Palmer said, is in recruiting ""the next generation of poll workers."" The aging workforce of poll workers has been an ongoing issue in elections. According to the EAC, the primary demographic working at polling sites are between the ages of 61 and 70.
Because of the pandemic, younger demographics helped out during the 2020 election. But this reverted a bit, Palmer said, during the last election.
""It's going to be a challenge for us as a community to continue to recruit those individuals that really are the backbone of the election,"" he said. ""So we really need the new generation. I guess Gen X needs to step up and start to fill some of these roles as the more elderly population retire or turn over the keys to the folks in the office."""

BANGKOK — Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office Tuesday pending an ethics investigation over a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader.
Opinion
Opinion: Thailand's deportation of Uyghurs to China has echoes of 10 years ago
The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to take the petition accusing her of a breach of ethics, and voted 7 to 2 to suspend her from duty as a prime minister. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.
Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the latest border dispute with Cambodia, involving an armed confrontation on May 28 in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. The leaked phone call while she engaged in diplomacy over the border dispute set off a string of complaints and public protests.
Sponsor Message
There was no immediate reaction from Paetongtarm after the court order. She said Monday that she would accept and follow the process although she didn't want to see her work interrupted.
It's expected that Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Jungrungruangkit will become the acting prime minister following Paetongtarn's suspension, although there's still no official confirmation.
Earlier Tuesday, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle forced when a major party left Paetongtarn's coalition government over the leaked phone call.

The reshuffle replaced former Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, which had held several Cabinet positions in her government.
Paetongtarn took the position of culture minister in addition to prime minister in the new Cabinet. She said she wanted to promote Thai culture on a global scale. It's unclear if she can take the oath to remain in that role.
Paetongtarn also faces investigations over an alleged breach of ethics by the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, whose decision could also lead to her removal.
The Constitutional Court last year removed her predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a bulwark of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.

Outrage over the call mostly revolved around Paetongtarn's comments toward an outspoken regional army commander and her perceived attempts to appease Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen to ease tensions at the border.
Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn's resignation."

The massive budget bill that Senate Republicans are debating pays for some of its tax cuts by slashing hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending. The latest report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates nearly 12 million people will lose health insurance if the Senate version of the bill becomes law.
Trump insists the cuts come from eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. Democrats have said they break Trump's promise not to touch Medicaid — and over the weekend, Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina agreed. ""What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding's not there anymore?""
We asked Sarah Jane Tribble, the chief rural correspondent for KFF Health News, what the cuts will mean for rural residents of states like North Carolina — and the hospitals that serve them.

The Supreme Court wrapped up its term last Friday — except it didn't.
Yes, the justices are by now heading for the beach, the golf course, or for some summer teaching gig abroad. But like it or not, they will still be working on a steady diet of emergency appeals from the Trump administration, or from immigrants being detained or deported by the administration, and much more.
That said, on the last day that the justices were in court, the conservative supermajority took unprecedented steps
to strip the lower courts
of the tool they have used most often to thwart Trump's aggressive agenda on everything from the independence of government agencies and employees, to immigration and the elimination, without congressional authorization, of important government agencies.
Sponsor Message
At the same time the Supreme Court was blocking much of what the lower courts have done, the high court gave itself, and only itself, the power to block most executive orders from the president.
Law
Supreme Court wraps up term with two big wins for conservatives, and Trump
Indeed, Trump, for now at least, has succeeded in changing the very nature of the court's work. The justices produced just 56 opinions this term in cases that had been briefed and argued. That's the lowest number since the 1930's. But in the five months since President Trump took office, the court, with only the rarest exception, has repeatedly granted his wishes to accrue power to the presidency.
A busy term on the ""shadow docket""
The bulk of that work, however, has been on
the so-called ""shadow docket,""
formally known as the ""emergency docket,"" which used to be primarily for last minute death penalty appeals. Today the death penalty appeals are still there, but they almost always fail, while Trump's emergency appeals almost always win without the court having full briefing or arguments, without any signed opinion fully explaining the court's reasoning, often without any explanation whatsoever, and almost always without any way to definitively know who voted in the majority.
""What's striking about these cases"" is that the court is almost never writing opinions that explain what it is doing, says Georgetown University law professor Stephen Vladeck. But the decisions are nonetheless ""massively impactful ... letting the administration continue to carry out initiatives that many think are lawless, while not necessarily settling the legality one way or the other.""
Law
The Supreme Court and 'The Shadow Docket'
At the same time, Vladeck observes, the court is ""preserving the justices' power at some unknown future point, if they want to, to step back in and say, actually this policy, this program, this firing, was illegal."" Practically speaking, though, Vladeck says it likely will be too late to do anything about it by then.

The court, however, did step in, quite aggressively to bar the administration from deporting immigrants without giving them adequate time
to challenge their deportations
in court. Those orders were quite literally at the last moment before deportation, and came in the middle of the night, sending the cases back to district court judges to deal with but without explanation as to how to do that.
Sponsor Message
In other immigration cases, however, the court, again in an unsigned and brief order, allowed the administration
to lift existing protections
for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and other countries.
With all the criticism the court is getting for its decision on nationwide injunctions, it has also gotten some support from lawyers who served in the Obama and Biden administrations because they too found almost all of the president's executive orders barred by lower court judges, particularly in Texas.
As Notre Dame law professor Samuel Bray observes, nationwide injunctions are relatively new, really blossoming in the 21
st
century, and leading to overt judge-shopping, meaning that a litigant looks for a sympathetic judge and files his case there, knowing what the outcome will be. The phenomenon has been particularly evident in parts of Texas, where judges are not randomly assigned to cases, so that a litigant can be sure who the judge will be.
Some of the same issues could crop up again with the alternative paths the Supreme Court left open to stop a policy nationwide. Already class actions have been filed to challenge Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, and the court said that states too can seek nationwide remedies for policies — such as Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship.
The author of the decision barring the federal district courts from issuing nationwide injunctions was not one of the court's more senior members. Rather Chief Justice John Roberts chose the second most junior justice to write the opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has proven to be a disciplined writer, able to hold on to a majority. Ironically, right wing critics have assailed her for not being conservative enough, and she has faced some scary threats as a result. But this term, anyway, she proved herself to be a skilled stalwart on the conservative side of the bench.
Sponsor Message
Other notable cases
The court, of course, had lots of other consequential decisions this term in cases that were fully briefed, argued and decided. It revived a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
regulation of unmarked and untraceable ""ghost guns,""
that can be put together from a kit in a matter of minutes. Until the ATF enacted the regulation, these kits could be bought online without any background check, and without presenting identification.
Law
Supreme Court upholds federal regulation banning 'ghost guns'
The conservative court also reversed nine of the 12 decisions it reviewed from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, widely viewed as the most conservative appeals court in the country, illustrating that there are courts more conservative than the current Supreme Court. In addition to the ghost gun case, justices reversed a Fifth Circuit decision that for a third time sought to gut a major part of the Affordable Care Act.
There were also a number of big wins this term in cases involving religious rights. The conservative court majority required public schools to provide
an opt out
from elementary school classes when the lesson includes material that parents find contrary to their religious beliefs. And in a case involving Catholic Charities, the court said that the state of Wisconsin violated the constitution by refusing to give a Catholic social ministry organization the same exemption from paying state unemployment taxes as it gives to churches. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal justice, wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.
The liberal justices, however, dissented when the court upheld state laws that ban
gender-affirming care for minors
. Roughly half the states have such laws, and the decision is likely to lead to more efforts to limit trans students in other areas, like sports.
Law
Supreme Court upholds state bans on transgender care for minors
There was no abortion case on the docket this term. But states that have a long history of opposition to abortion, won an important victory when the court, after years of resisting the question, ruled that states may deny Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, although it is a qualified provider for a variety of
non-abortion
medical services."

The Justice Department has charged a
Pakistani national who allegedly orchestrated
a $650 million fraud scheme that primarily targeted an Arizona Medicaid program offering addiction treatment and other services for Native Americans.
Court papers say the defendant, Farrukh Ali, conspired with at least 41 addiction clinics to bill the state for hundreds of millions of dollars for addiction services that were never provided, not provided as billed or were medically unnecessary. Many of the patients who were enrolled — but not given legitimate treatment — were recruited from the homeless population or Native American reservations, officials say.
The Ali indictment is one of nearly 200 federal cases that the department announced Monday as part of its 2025 national health care fraud takedown. The effort is part of the department's long-running campaign to combat fraud in the health care sector, which officials estimate at around $300 billion per year.

in department history, officials said.

""Today marks a decisive moment in our fight to protect American taxpayers from fraudsters, and to defend the integrity of America's health care system,"" said Matthew Galeotti, the head of the department's Criminal Division.
""These criminals didn't just steal someone else's money. They stole from you,"" he added. ""Every fraudulent claim, every fake billing, every kickback scheme represents money taken directly from the pockets of American taxpayers.""
The actual losses in the charged cases total $2.9 billion, according to the department.
The cases reflect the full spectrum of health care fraud, from an alleged $10.6 billion urinary catheter scheme by a transnational criminal organization to a purported $1 billion wound care scheme targeting hospice Medicare patients and Ali's alleged fraud scheme in Arizona.
How did the alleged fraud scheme work?
Ali, who is not in U.S. custody and is believed to be in Pakistan, faces conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering charges. He could not be reached for comment.
According to prosecutors, he owned and operated a company called ProMD Solutions LLC, which was organized in Arizona but based in Pakistan. The firm provided credentialing and enrolling, medical coding and billing services for medical practices, court papers say.
Sponsor Message
Between April 2021 and July 2023, prosecutors say that Ali struck agreements with at least 41 addiction clinics in Arizona, including two identified in court papers as TUSA and CHWC. Both companies were listed as outpatient treatment centers that purportedly provided treatment services for people suffering from addiction to drugs and alcohol, according to court papers.
In order to get and keep patients that could bill the state's Medicaid system, the owners allegedly paid kickbacks and bribes to the owners of sober homes. A premium, however, was put on patients who were enrolled in Arizona's program for Native Americans, known as AIHP, because they could receive higher reimbursements from the state system.
""In the greater Phoenix area, they were obtaining patients from homeless shelters, encampments, street corners, hospitals, detox centers,"" said a Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.
Law
78 people face charges for $2.5 billion in attempted health care fraud, DOJ says
""They were also going to Native American reservations in vans and offering substance abuse treatment and free room and board in Phoenix. And at times, entire families or couples were recruited into it, and they were largely alcoholics or opioid or meth addicts involved in this.""
As part of the purported conspiracy, Ali credentialed and enrolled these clinics as providers with Arizona's Medicaid system even though the clinics did not provide legitimate care to patients. Ali's company then billed the state system for the clinics in exchange for a 5 percent cut of the money the state paid out to the facilities.
Ali and his co-conspirators, court papers say, submitted ""false and fraudulent claims … for behavioral health substance abuse treatment therapy services that were not provided, were not provided as billed, were not provided by qualified personnel, were so substandard that they failed to serve a treatment purpose, were not used or integrated into any treatment plan, and/or were medically unnecessary.""
Sponsor Message
They tried to cover up the false claims, according to prosecutors, by falsifying or altering therapy notes to show that patients attended therapy when they did not or that therapy was provided when it was not.
Prosecutors say Ali and the owners of TUSA and CHWC submitted false claims for some $57 million, and were paid out almost $52 million by the state.
In total, Ali submitted some $650 million in false claims, and he and the 41 clinics received approximately $564 million in payments from Arizona's Medicaid system.
Prosecutors say that Ali used almost $3 million of the nearly $25 million he received under the scheme to buy a home on a golf estate in Dubai, U.A.E."

to their version, and after that the House and Senate versions would still need to be
reconciled
.

Politics
Reconciliation is the key to unlocking Trump's agenda. Here's how it works
But for EV advocates who had hoped the Senate would extend the life of the EV tax credits, the draft released over the weekend was a blow.
""To vote for this bill as written is to effectively abandon the goal we all share of making the United States globally competitive in the mineral, battery, and vehicle production markets of the future,"" Albert Gore III, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, wrote in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned American Energy Alliance celebrated the prospect of rapidly terminating EV tax credits. ""Extending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful,"" the group's president, Tom Pyle, wrote in a statement.
In an interesting development, the nation's auto dealers — who, during the Biden administration, were
vocally skeptical
of electric vehicles — have been lobbying to keep the EV tax credits in place for longer. The National Automobile Dealers Association has urged Congress to include what they call ""a reasonable transition period.""
""An abrupt repeal of the EV tax credits would disrupt the car market and cause unnecessary consumer confusion,"" the group wrote in a statement emailed to NPR. And Carmax and Carvana, two nationwide used-vehicle giants, joined an
open letter
calling for credits to continue ""for at least the next several years,"" arguing that sudden elimination would be too disruptive to the used auto market in particular. The current tax credit includes a used vehicle credit, worth up to $4,000 per car, explicitly designed to bring EVs within reach for lower- and middle-income car shoppers.
Sponsor Message
Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), a former car dealer and a vocal critic of EVs, laid out part of the Republican argument against the tax credits in remarks on the
Senate floor
over the weekend. He raised the hypothetical example of a billionaire who decides to lease a $500,000 electric Rolls-Royce. ""The Democrats gave that billionaire a check for $7,500,"" he said. ""They say we're helping billionaires, when they're giving $7,500 checks to people who lease these cars. Sick.""
It's true that the tax credit for leasing an EV — sometimes called the lease loophole — does not have the same
income and price restrictions
as the rest of the EV tax credits.
EV tax credits were not the only green provision to get more radical cuts from the Senate's weekend draft than they did in the House bill. The Senate is considering not only
pulling tax credits for wind and solar projects
, but adding new taxes on those renewable energy sources, unless companies can prove they don't use Chinese components. And the Senate might eliminate all fees on automakers who don't comply with fuel economy rules, which environmental groups say would make those regulations toothless.
On the other hand, not every rollback of EV policy contained in the House version of the bill survived the Senate's revision process. A new yearly fee on electric vehicles and hybrids was not in the latest version (though it may return in a separate bill). Neither was a proposal to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency's rules for tailpipe emissions standards."

the joint federal/state health insurance program for more than 70 million low-income and disabled people.
The Senate bill would cut more than $1 trillion from the program and the  latest report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates nearly
12 million people will lose health insurance
if it  becomes law. The plan would require able bodied adults to work 80 hours per month until age 65 to qualify for benefits, and would also cap and gradually reduce the tax states can impose on Medicaid providers.

The GOP megabill faces a final hurdle in the House. Here's what's inside the plan
Several GOP senators have raised concerns that the tax is a critical funding stream for rural hospitals. If that income dries up,
many hospitals could close
.
""Medicaid cuts would place significant financial pressure on hospitals in rural states, where many hospitals are already at risk of closure. In more than half of states, reductions in Medicaid funding for rural hospitals would exceed 20%,"" according to the
National Rural Health Association
.
Senate GOP leaders have included a
new $25 billion fund to support rural hospitals
in the bill to alleviate some of those concerns.
But Sarah Jane Tribble, chief rural correspondent at KFF Health News, told NPR that many health care officials in rural areas say it's not enough. In fact, it's only 43% of what is needed for rural hospitals to offset the cuts coming in the Senate proposal, she said.
""And even worse, that rural transformation fund won't just go to rural hospitals, it'll go to health clinics and federally qualified health care centers, community mental health and opioid treatment centers, too, by their estimates,"" Tribble said. ""So, they really don't think it's enough to offset it.""
Tribble has been speaking with people from rural communities and they are worried that the proposed cuts will push rural health care to the brink of collapse. ""I'm not hearing good things,"" she said.
Policy-ish
U.S. uninsured rates could resurge if Trump's budget bill passes
""They're very concerned because Medicaid rates are so high in rural America that these cuts will be very detrimental. They'll cause more hospitals to close. They'll tax rural health clinics,"" Tribble told
All Things Considered
host Juana Summers.
The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Juana Summers:
Give us some details about some of the types of ways in which rural hospitals could be impacted. Like, I guess I'm trying to figure out how these cuts would work and what they would mean for patients.

Sarah Jane Tribble:
Well, for rural hospitals, they're specifically already on the line.
More than 150 hospitals have either closed completely or shut down their inpatient beds since 2010, according to the
UNC Sheps Center in North Carolina. Another 267 rural  hospitals have closed their obstetrics units from 2011 to 2021.
So, these hospitals are already, you know, showing signs of duress underneath the current health system economics, if you will. And really, Congress has acknowledged this over the years, passing a new Rural Emergency Hospital Act a couple of years ago, trying to help shore up these hospitals.
Summers:
The White House put out a fact sheet making the point that the bill will not cut Medicaid. The fact sheet calls it a myth that the bill will close rural hospitals. How do you parse  those claims?
Tribble:
So, when you talk to anybody from, say, Georgetown or some of the other experts out there, they have analyzed the numbers of who's using Medicaid in rural America — say, moms, working-age adults. These are patients of these hospitals.
And if you decrease the number of people receiving Medicaid in rural areas, then you're going to decrease the amount of revenue the hospitals and clinics get because they just have less paying patients.
Shots - Health News
In a county that backed Trump, people depend on Medicaid and are conflicted about cuts
But also, there are some other provisions in the bill that experts have analyzed as far as work requirements and the provider taxes and state-directed payments. Those all do hit rural America in different ways, especially the expansion states.
Summers:
As you pointed out, rural hospitals have been on the decline for years, with many having closed in the last few decades, even more facing risk of immediate closure. I wonder, what does all of this mean for patients? I've heard about how these closures are particularly problematic, for example, for trauma care, cancer treatment.
Sponsor Message
Tribble:
I've done a lot of reporting over the years where I talk to patients who travel long distances for their care. I did a story out of New Mexico where they were setting up telehealth services after a hospital had closed its obstetrics units so patients wouldn't have to drive for every single prenatal visit.
Those are situations that are already sort of on the brink, if you will, where patients are having to drive long distances when they're delivering babies or even for trauma care, where helicopters have to show up and go significant distances to get people to care. And that's because rural hospitals have been closing and rural care, in general, has been declining over the past couple of decades. There's a lot of places where there's just not enough providers in general. And when a rural hospital closes, providers tend to leave the area."

Walsh says it might be tough for the House to pass the bill if the Senate approves it
, as Republicans have already
signaled issues with the changes made
. The bill boosts federal spending for border enforcement and the military and increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to avoid a default this summer. The bulk of cuts in the bill come from changes to Medicaid, Walsh says. The changes would include adding work requirements for many enrolled now and adjusting the way the states finance their Medicaid programs. Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper says the changes to Medicaid could mean almost 12 million Americans lose coverage.

The pelvic floor plays a crucial role in the body. It supports the bladder, bowels, and reproductive system and works with the abdominal muscles to help support the spine. Many people are unaware of these muscles, making it challenging to assess problems and seek appropriate treatment when issues arise. Research indicates that one in three women will experience a pelvic floor disorder at some point in their lives. Physical therapist Sara Reardon spoke with
Life Kit
about what people with vaginas should know about their pelvic floor and
what to do if you have pelvic floor pain
.
➡️ Power peeing, or pushing out pee, is not good for you. You want to sit, relax and let it flow.
➡️ A symptom of pelvic floor dysfunction is the inability to relax the muscles needed to empty your bowels due to excessive tightness or tension. This could lead to straining with bowel movements, hemorrhoids, fissures, incomplete emptying and feeling like your stools are thin.
➡️ Address pelvic floor tension by varying your movements throughout the day and watching your posture. If you are sitting, keep your feet flat or crossed at the ankles. Take deep breaths throughout the day to soften your pelvic floor muscles.

Trump says he's terminating trade talks with Canada, 'effective immediately'
U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called ""a direct and blatant attack on our country.""
The Canadian government said ""in anticipation"" of a trade deal ""Canada would rescind"" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.
Carney and Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.

""Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,"" Carney said in a statement.
Carney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.
Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.
The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.
Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a ""clear victory"" for Trump.
""At some point this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,"" Béland said.

""In Washington over the last few years, it's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species,"" he wrote.
He also suggested some in his own party care more about political points than the impact of policies they vote on, saying, ""Too many elected officials are motivated by pure raw politics who really don't give a damn about the people they promised to represent on the campaign trail.""

Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said ""Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war,"" without addressing Merdawi's claim.
Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses.
The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage.
Gaza's Health Ministry on Sunday said another 88 people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the war's toll among Palestinians to 56,500. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas government, does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.
The war has displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape and left people overwhelmingly reliant on outside aid, which Israel has limited since the end of the latest ceasefire.
Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are even partly functional, and over 4,000 children need medical evacuation abroad, a new U.N. humanitarian assessment says.

The Trump administration has, for the first time ever, built a searchable national citizenship data system.
The tool, which is being rolled out in phases, is designed to be used by state and local election officials to give them an easier way to ensure only citizens are voting. But it was developed rapidly without a public process, and some of those officials are already worrying about what else it could be used for.
NPR is the first news organization to report the details of the new system.
For decades, voting officials have noted that there was no national citizenship list to compare their state lists to, so to verify citizenship for their voters, they either needed to ask people to provide a birth certificate or a passport — something that
could disenfranchise millions
— or use a complex patchwork of disparate data sources.

1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters say they can't easily show proof of their citizenship
Now, the Department of Homeland Security is offering another way.
DHS, in partnership with the White House's Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) team, has recently rolled out a series of upgrades to a network of federal databases to allow state and county election officials to quickly check the citizenship status of their entire voter lists — both U.S.-born and naturalized citizens — using data from the Social Security Administration as well as immigration databases.
Such integration has never existed before, and experts call it a sea change that inches the U.S. closer to having a roster of citizens — something the country has never embraced. A centralized national database of Americans' personal information has long been considered a third rail — especially to privacy advocates as well as political conservatives, who have traditionally opposed mass data consolidation by the federal government.
Legal experts told NPR they were alarmed that a development of this magnitude was already underway without a transparent and public process.
""That is a debate that needs to play out in a public setting,"" said John Davisson, the director of litigation at the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""It's one that deserves public scrutiny and sunlight, that deserves the participation of elected representatives, that deserves opportunities for the public to weigh in through public comment and testimony.""
Sponsor Message
When federal agencies plan to collect or use Americans' personal data in new ways, there are procedures they are required to follow beforehand, including giving public notice.
Another privacy expert, University of Virginia School of Law professor Danielle Citron, called this data aggregation effort a ""hair on fire"" development. She told NPR she has questions if the project itself is lawful.
Many other questions about the new system remain, including which states plan to use it and how, what sort of data security measures are being taken and how trustworthy the data the tool provides will be. It's also unknown what the federal government plans to do with the voter records after they've been run through the system.

about widespread noncitizen voting makes election experts wary of how this new tool will work.
""We've never had a list of U.S. citizens to compare our voter registration lists to,"" said Kim Wyman, the former Republican secretary of state of Washington who is now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""It seems like it takes the federal government more than just [a few] months to be able to make a comprehensive national database of information that's going to be accurate … That's what my concern is, just first and foremost, that the list is accurate.""

Everyone registering to vote must swear, under penalty of perjury, that they are a U.S. citizen. The consequences for noncitizens who try to vote include fines, prison time and deportation. Officials say that deterrent is why cases of ineligible people casting ballots are incredibly rare — a fact that's become increasingly apparent as
more
and
more
states devote resources to uncovering the few people that slip through the cracks every election. Research has also
shown
that when noncitizens do vote, it's often not to commit fraud but rather because they misunderstood eligibility rules.

Trump and his allies have continued to emphasize the issue. The Justice Department has

and state level to require people show proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.

The House has passed the Trump-backed SAVE Act. Here are 8 things to know
If this new tool is successful, it could provide local and state governments a powerful method to check the citizenship of almost all Americans without additional documentation requirements.
""Taking that burden of proof, if you will, off the voter … is a good thing,"" said Wyman, who also worked for the Department of Homeland Security on election security issues in the Biden administration.
But she noted that a national citizenship list and anything resembling a national voter registration list have been controversial ideas for a long time, so the Trump administration is wading into uncharted waters.
""All of us that live in this free country and this free society want to believe that there are some privacy rights that are still being upheld in our lives,"" Wyman said. ""The attention to detail matters here in many, many big ways.""
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, is managing the tool. The agency did not provide more information about how it will work when contacted by NPR. In a statement, spokesman Matthew Tragesser called the development a ""game changer"" and said the agency looks forward to ""implementing more updates.""
""USCIS is moving quickly to eliminate benefit and voter fraud among the alien population,"" Tragesser said.
What SAVE did and what it does now
This new citizenship check capability comes from a massive expansion of a tool voting officials only used sparingly in the past.
The tool, known as the
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements
, or SAVE, is a system of DHS databases that state and federal agencies have queried since the 1980s to check the immigration status of noncitizens living in the U.S. legally. Agencies can then decide if the applicants are eligible for different government benefits.
Sponsor Message
For roughly the past decade, some voting officials have also used SAVE to check the citizenship of voters on their rolls, usually in instances where department of motor vehicle records indicated a voter is a noncitizen, since those records often aren't updated when a person naturalizes. Election officials could use SAVE to get a more recent immigration snapshot, which would either verify that a person had become a citizen and was indeed eligible to vote, or if no naturalization record was found, indicate to the official that they should reach out to the voter about whether they are a citizen.
But using SAVE for this sort of verification was unwieldy.
Untangling Disinformation
GOP lawsuits about an obscure immigration database may set up election challenges
Election officials across the political spectrum complained they did not have the specific immigration identification numbers needed to query the system, and in cases where they did, it was expensive and labor intensive to submit one query at a time. Ahead of the 2024 election, some Republican-led states ramped up their complaints about the inadequacies of the tool. Just weeks before the election, Texas, Florida and Ohio
sued
DHS, arguing the Biden administration was failing to help states verify their voters' citizenship.
USCIS began planning upgrades to the system at the end of the Biden administration, according to a person who attended a briefing where it was discussed but was not authorized to speak to the media. After Trump took office, DHS began a series of regular calls with some state election staffers to talk through potential updates.
A key turning point came in March, when Trump signed an executive order that made sweeping changes to voting and election protocols, including requiring DHS to allow states ""access to appropriate systems"" for verifying the citizenship of voters on their rolls without a cost, and instructing DOGE to assist the agency in combing voter rolls for noncitizens.

The order also instructed the attorney general to prioritize prosecuting noncitizens who register to vote, whether they actually voted or not, using ""databases or information maintained by the Department of Homeland Security.""

Within weeks, USCIS began announcing rolling upgrades to SAVE, crediting DOGE with the changes. On April 22, the
agency revealed SAVE
was now free for non-federal agencies, and could handle mass checks. Then,
a May 22 news release
announced SAVE had integrated data from the Social Security Administration so election officials could query it with a nine-digit Social Security number.
Though the May news release didn't mention it explicitly, the Social Security change meant for the first time SAVE could verify the citizenship of U.S.-born Americans with a valid Social Security number, which
nearly every
American citizen has.
That development is a major move that turned SAVE from a tool that only responded to queries about foreign-born citizens or noncitizens into something that could comb through entire voter lists. But numerous state voting officials NPR spoke with were not aware that capability was part of the updates.
As recently as late April, a USCIS fact sheet about using SAVE for voting records said the opposite. ""SAVE does not verify U.S. born citizens under any circumstances. SAVE does not access databases that contain U.S.-born citizen information,"" the web page read, according to a
snapshot
captured by the Internet Archive.
That has now been changed. In a
version
that was last updated in June, the fact sheet now says that looking up U.S.-born citizens is possible with a Social Security number. ""SAVE is able in many cases to verify U.S.-born U.S. citizens for voter verification purposes, through information accessed through the SSA,"" it reads. NPR has not yet spoken to a state voting official who has looked up a U.S.-born citizen on the new SAVE platform.
Sponsor Message
Social Security Administration data systems can show whether an applicant was a citizen or a noncitizen at the time they received their number, said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who works at the liberal-leaning policy nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The Department of Homeland Security has combined that point-in-time citizenship information with SAVE's ability to more thoroughly tell whether a person has naturalized to create a system that voting officials can use to theoretically nail down citizenship status for voters they have Social Security numbers for.
Upon hearing the details, numerous voting data experts told NPR it sounded like a system that could work. The question, they say, is whether quality control systems are in place to catch the inevitable mistakes that will come from comparing hundreds of millions of records, especially when the stakes are as high as questioning someone's citizenship.
There are some known data challenges with SAVE. For instance, there can be a lag time between when a person naturalizes and when that information is entered into the system, which can lead to the initial appearance that a person is a noncitizen on the voter rolls if they registered to vote immediately after naturalizing. SAVE materials also make clear there are some foreign-born citizens who cannot be verified by the system.

USCIS acknowledges these shortfalls and tells users that if the system returns an answer other than confirming citizenship, then it must also be manually reviewed by USCIS staff, and the elections office must contact the voter to give them a chance to provide proof of citizenship.
It's also unclear how reliable or complete the data coming from the Social Security Administration is, because as MIT election expert Charles Stewart notes, that data as well as the data within SAVE and on the voter rolls was collected independently and without this sort of integration in mind. A report from the
Institute for Responsive Government
noted recently that the SSA only began adding citizenship tags to records roughly 40 years ago, so the agency's data on natural-born citizens may be incomplete.
Sponsor Message
""The concern with any of these data-based matching procedures is that people who don't know much about voter registration datasets just assume that the data are clean on [all] sides,"" said Stewart.
The most notable election data matching success story, a program called the
Electronic Registration Information Center
(ERIC), took multiple years to develop and roll out. The system allows its more than two dozen member states to share government data across state lines, to eliminate dead voters from the rolls, find the few people in every federal election who illegally vote twice, and also register eligible voters when they move to a new place.
Investigations
How the far right tore apart one of the best tools to fight voter fraud
Nine Republican-led states have since pulled out of the organization due to viral falsehoods that
spread on the far-right
and general uneasiness about having a third party combing through state voter rolls. At least two of those states,
Louisiana
and
Texas
, are early piloters of this new data tool run by the federal government. The states have not disclosed many details and declined NPR's interview requests.
DHS says so far it has run more than 9 million voter records through the upgraded SAVE system, according to a person who attended a briefing about the new capabilities who was not authorized to speak to the media, and that early analysis found those records to contain 99.99% U.S. citizens. That analysis has not been independently verified, and it's not clear if any of the few noncitizens they did find ever actually voted.
""If this rolls out and it turns out that our voter rolls are pretty darn accurate … and it is shouted from the mountaintops and people believe it, then that would be big,"" said Tammy Patrick, an election expert at the nonprofit Election Center and former Arizona voting official. She noted however that there are large financial incentives, both for candidates and for grassroots election denial
groups and influencers
, to keep pushing misleading claims about noncitizen voting.
Sponsor Message
""My concern is that I'm not so sure that there will be those who will believe it, that there will be those who will stop raising donations and campaign funds on the narrative of fear-mongering and the illegitimacy of our systems,"" Patrick said.
Investigations
Election deniers have taken their fraud theories on tour — to nearly every state
Most states can't use the new SAVE capabilities yet because they don't collect full Social Security numbers as part of the voter registration process.
But the next SAVE upgrade will allow election officials to query with just the last four digits of a Social Security number, in addition to a full name and birthdate, according to two people who were on calls where such plans were discussed but asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plan. Such an expansion will make the citizenship searches available for all voting officials, although there is a wide range across the country when it comes to how much of a state's voter records have even partial Social Security numbers associated with them.
Future plans also include integrating state DMV data, according to the same sources, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to reach out to every state's chief election official soon encouraging them to run their rolls through the system.
Some Republican election officials have been happy that DHS is taking their concerns about SAVE seriously. Idaho's Republican Secretary of State Phil McGrane used SAVE extensively ahead of the 2024 election, but found it difficult to use.
""This wasn't what the database was meant for and we were asking something of it that it really wasn't designed for,"" McGrane told NPR in early June. ""Now there is attention being put to it to make it work that way.""
However when NPR reached out more recently to ask about SAVE's new broader citizenship check capabilities, a spokesperson for McGrane's office, Chelsea Carattini, said the secretary had not been briefed or made aware of those changes by the federal government.

Who gets to know what's being built
While USCIS denied NPR's interview request about the changes and has sporadically shared updates with some state voting officials, a DHS staffer gave a full briefing about the tool to an influential group known for pushing false and misleading election fraud narratives.
On June 12, the Election Integrity Network, a grassroots group led by conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell, who worked with Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election, hosted a virtual event with David Jennings, who oversees the SAVE system. Democracy Docket
first reported
the briefing.
NPR also acquired audio of Mitchell seemingly speaking about Jennings at an earlier Election Integrity Network event in May. The nonprofit investigative group Documented, an investigative watchdog and journalism project, provided a recording to NPR.
""He is in charge of the SAVE database that has the citizenship data for, you know, everybody,"" Mitchell said at the May event. ""And he is in the process of reconfiguring the entire [thing] so that we can actually determine who on the voter rolls is and is not a citizen.""
Voting experts NPR spoke with expressed concern that the agency overseeing the creation of the voter data tool was sharing details with a group involved with denying the 2020 election results, but not the American public.
""Before the federal government just up and creates a massive data system that purports to be a record on all of us — that's a public conversation that we're owed,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor and former Biden White House adviser on voting rights. ""And not just as a public policy matter, as a moral matter, as a legal matter.""
Under the Privacy Act of 1974, there is a formal process known as a system of records notice, for federal agencies to give public notice about new ways they intend to collect or use Americans' personal information. No such notice appears to have been published for the upgrade to SAVE that integrates Social Security data, and neither USCIS or SSA responded to an NPR inquiry asking if a new one had been issued.

Data unknowns
The SAVE upgrade is part of a larger trend, led by DOGE, of the Trump administration taking
unprecedented steps to amass and connect data
across the federal government. The effort has sparked over a dozen lawsuits and cybersecurity concerns.
Politics
DOGE says it needs to know the government's most sensitive data, but can't say why
The public officials condemning the data consolidation have mostly been Democrats, however, which is a departure from past privacy debates in American history.
""One thing that's rather striking about these moves around data in the present is that there has been so little outcry actually on the right, who have been sort of the standard bearers of worry about big government and data merging and data collection to begin with,"" said Sarah Igo, a history professor at Vanderbilt University.
One conservative voice who is expressing such concerns is Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of the nonprofit True the Vote, which has pushed numerous election conspiracy theories over the past decade.
Engelbrecht praised the SAVE effort in
a recent newsletter
, but expressed discomfort about the administration's efforts to centralize various federal databases and
give access to the contractor Palantir
.
""Such centralization of data poses a threat to individual freedoms and privacy,"" she wrote. ""Surrendering our data to unchecked power isn't just a technical risk — it's a moral failure.""
Technology
How Palantir, the secretive tech company, is rising in the Trump era
One of the biggest questions about the new SAVE is what happens to the voter data that states and counties upload to the system, particularly since it is now designed to verify entire state voter rolls.
USCIS specifies that it
retains records
of SAVE queries for 10 years. The agency did not respond to NPR's questions about whether it will keep copies of state voter rolls uploaded to SAVE, or whether it will use information states provide through the system as a basis for criminal or immigration investigations.
A state election official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the development told NPR they were specifically worried about how the administration would use information provided by states in immigration crackdown efforts. For that reason, the official, who has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations, said they expected there to be a clear partisan division in which states use it, even if all election officials have the same goal of accurate voter rolls.
""If I believed this database was accurate, and that I was going to get good usable information from it, you're damn right I would use it,"" the official said. ""The question is, is the data usable? And [usable] in a way that I'm not going to jeopardize people who live in my jurisdiction?""

But tariffs have now entered the bridal fitting room.
Couples are discovering that almost all U.S. wedding dresses are made abroad — even if they're designed in the States. And China is where most are stitched and embellished. According to the National Bridal Retailers Association, China accounts for a whopping 90% of the bridal gown market.
The Indicator from Planet Money
You told us how tariffs are affecting you
For a while, those Chinese-made wedding dresses faced a new tariff of 145% set by President Trump, which is now
temporarily cut
to 30% until July 9. The two countries
are still negotiating
, and brides are starting to pay up.
Jessica Kaplan from Boston arrived at her bridal appointment to a warning from store staff: all gowns now carry a tariff surcharge of 10% to 15% depending on the designer and their supply chain. Kaplan's A-line dress with a sweetheart neckline and a long tail ended up on the lower end, but still cost an extra $150.
""It wasn't detrimental,"" she says, ""but it was definitely a bummer on the day.""
Urban Set Bride co-owner Christine Greenberg says tariffs affect not only gowns, but many other imports needed at her Virginia store: veils, hairpieces, garment bags, hangers and even paper for the check-out register. ""It adds up very quickly,"" Greenberg says, ""and we're a small shop.""

Store owners struggle to budget
Unlike clothes bought off the rack, wedding gowns are usually special order. When someone buys a dress from Claire Landgraf's Finery Bridal Chic in Rochester, Minn., the order may take six or eight months.
""So what's the landscape of tariff charging going to look like in six to eight months? We don't know,"" she says.

Landgraf has already spent hundreds of dollars on tariffs for dresses that brides had ordered before Trump took office. What if the opposite happens now, and she charges brides a fee for a future tariff of an unclear amount?
Business
A small U.S. town grew a big company. Can it weather the tariff blizzard?
""I don't feel good as a business owner about saying, 'Hey, Miss Bride who bought a gown at the top of her budget at $2,000 that included that tariff fee, months from now your gown came in and all of a sudden the tariff charge is another $300,'"" Landgraf says. ""I can't do that to brides. So it's just really, really uncertain.""
It's not just gowns arriving from China, but also trims and crystals, veils and hair pieces, hangers and garment bags. Most designers, including the popular Grace Loves Lace and Revelry, have decided to simply
raise prices
across the board to cover new tariff costs. Some by as much as 30%. Many store owners have followed suit.
Landgraf, for now, is adding a surcharge that she can remove later if tariffs disappear — and budgeting for refunds.

Double the cost for Made in the USA
U.S. brides — outside of big cities — on average spend less than $2,000 on a wedding dress, Landgraf and Greenberg estimate. American-made dresses tend to start around twice that price.
And not only are there few people buying them, but there are very few people making them.
""Unlike other industries, these dresses cannot be made in the United States,"" the National Bridal Retailers Association wrote earlier this year in
a lobbying letter
to U.S. lawmakers, ""as there is zero labor pool of skilled craftsmen that can hand-bead gowns with as many as 200,000 sequins, beads, and crystals.""
One of Trump's arguments for tariffs is to jump-start
more American manufacturing
. But U.S. textile and garment-making prowess faded decades ago. It would take many years to train enough technicians in lace work or embroidery to dress legions of American brides.
Economy
Trump tariff revenue soars 78%. Who's paying them?
""My dad was in the Army for 24 years — I would love to purchase American-made wedding gowns,"" says Greenberg, the Virginia shopkeeper. ""But they don't really exist, certainly not at the price point that the average American consumer could purchase a wedding gown.""
And so, some of the most popular U.S. gown makers, including Utah-based Maggie Sottero and Tennessee-based Allure, have urged the federal government to exempt formalwear from tariffs, saying instead of bringing back jobs, tariffs would shutter businesses.

Her dream dress is dazzling white with a mermaid silhouette, flaring dramatically at the bottom. It's likely her fabric and materials would still have to be imported.

President Trump's massive tax and spending bill, containing much of his domestic agenda, has successfully passed through Congress.
By a vote of 218-214, the House of Representatives
narrowly approved the bill
on Thursday,
just days after the Senate
did the same. Now, the legislation heads to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on July 4, meeting his long-time deadline.
The House passed an initial version of the bill
in late May
, but had to vote on the latest version of the plan after the Senate made changes.
GOP lawmakers in both chambers agreed on the legislation's key pillars, including an extension of President Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as increased funding for border security, defense and energy production. But there were deep disagreements over how to pay for these policies.
Sponsor Message
Despite the divides, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were able to get Republicans over the finish line, albeit by small margins.
Here's a quick look at some of the bill's key provisions.
Extending the Trump tax cuts
The bill calls for $4 trillion in tax cuts, which is slightly higher than the $3.8 trillion originally proposed in the House. It extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year, meaning that without an extension, most households would have seen their taxes increase.
Additional tax incentives
Congressional Republicans included many of the
president's tax-related campaign promises
in the bill. The bill includes temporary changes that would allow Americans to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime pay through 2028. It also says that overtime and tip deductions will be reduced for Americans with incomes higher than $150,000. Those limits were not included in the original House version.
The bill also increases the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and adjusts the amount for inflation after 2025.
In addition, the bill would permanently expand the standard deduction. Republicans also boosted a tax deduction for people over 65 to $6,000 through 2028. Both chambers included a phase out for people earning over $75,000.
Sponsor Message
Increasing the debt ceiling
The final legislation lifts the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion, a sizable increase compared to the House bill, which agreed to $4 trillion.
Lifting
the debt limit
doesn't authorize new spending. Instead, it allows the government to pay for programs that Congress has already authorized. If the cap isn't lifted and the government can't meet its obligations, then it will be at risk of default — a scenario that economists say would be catastrophic not just for the U.S., but the global financial system as a whole. An
estimate from
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that without action from Congress, the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills at some point between mid-August and the end of September.
Medicaid
Changes to Medicaid were one of the
most divisive issues
throughout both House and Senate negotiations.
The GOP plan requires able bodied adults to work 80 hours per month until age 65 to qualify for benefits. There are carve outs for parents of children under 14 and those with disabilities. But even with those exceptions, the bill's cuts could lead to nearly 12 million people losing health coverage, according to estimates from the CBO.
The plan also caps and gradually reduces the tax states can impose on Medicaid providers. The phase out would begin in 2028, ultimately ending in a 3.5% cap on that tax. It's a change that some GOP Senators expressed concern with, arguing the tax is a critical funding stream for rural hospitals in particular, and cutting it could put many of these hospitals at risk of closing.
In an effort to alleviate some of those concerns, Senate GOP leaders included a new $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals. That program would also begin in 2028 and funds would be spread out over five years.
Changes to SNAP
Both the Senate and House outlined reforms for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which provides aid for food to more than 40 million low-income Americans.
Sponsor Message
The final bill includes expanded work requirements that ""able bodied adults"" continue to work up to age 64. There are exemptions for parents with children under 14 and limits on the ways states can offer waivers for those requirements.
The bill also forces states to take on a greater share of the cost of providing food assistance. The amount a state owes would be based on a formula set by the percentage of erroneous payments reported each year. Those changes would go into effect in 2028.
Billions for border security
The GOP bill allocates $46.5 billion toward completing Trump's border wall. It also puts $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities and $10 billion to be used for border security more broadly. The bill sets aside $4.1 billion to hire and retain more agents and officers, and invests in upgraded technology for screenings and surveillance of U.S. borders.
Clean energy tax incentives phase out
The bill phases out tax incentives for clean energy sooner than scheduled. Without the tax credits, America is likely to build fewer wind and solar projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity,
according to a study this winter
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.
The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said in a statement that the Senate bill ""undermines the very foundation of America's manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership.""
Industry executives and analysts say clean energy is crucial to meet rising electricity demand from things like data centers, because the projects are quick to build and produce electricity that's relatively cheap.
Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas, said abruptly unwinding the incentives would hit consumers through higher electricity bills.
""We will still see solar built,"" Lewin said. ""We'll just see less of it. And it'll be more expensive.""
Sponsor Message
U.S. solar manufacturers are also worried. The incentives that are being phased out encourage companies building clean energy projects to use equipment and components made in American factories. Manufacturers and their supporters warn that quickly ending the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector.
""As we have been telling Members of Congress for months, this bill will lead to a flood of Chinese imports, hurting U.S. manufacturing jobs and investments,"" Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said in a statement.
State and Local Tax Deduction
One of the thorniest issues during negotiations was the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT. The deduction was particularly important to a small number of GOP lawmakers in the House from blue states with high taxes, such as California and New York. Trump's 2017 tax cuts capped the SALT deduction at $10,000. The bill temporarily lifts the cap to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. But that provision expires after 2028 — an effort to buoy the blue-state Republicans through the 2026 midterm and 2028 election cycles, while limiting the long-term impact of the cuts on federal tax revenue.
New immigration fees
The bill includes a handful of new or increased fees for immigration services. It would create a $550 charge for work authorization applications with renewal every six months.
However, the Senate parliamentarian determined that a $1,000 fee for asylum applications did not meet the rules necessary to qualify for a simple majority vote.
A student loan overhaul
The legislation scraps several existing loan repayment options, including the Biden-era SAVE program that based payments on income and household size. It replaces them with
a new, standard repayment plan
and an income-based plan Republicans call their ""Repayment Assistance Plan."" The bill also caps the amount that parents and graduate students can take out in federal loans each year.
Sponsor Message
One difference between the two bills concerned the Pell Grant program for low-income students. The House proposed increasing the credit hours required for full-time and part-time students in order to receive Pell Grants, but the Senate left current enrollment rules intact. The Senate bill does bar students from qualifying for a Pell Grant if they've received a full scholarship through other sources of aid.

Thousands of supporters queued for a chance to mourn the three at the Capitol building, including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who said in a statement on Saturday that she was not able to attend the funeral due to a potential vote on the Senate

""I join the state and the country in honoring our beloved friends Melissa and Mark Hortman,"" Klobuchar said. ""In speaking with their children Sophie and Colin yesterday at the Minnesota Capitol, I know that Melissa and Mark's legacy of goodness and service to others is in the best of hands.""

At the funeral service, the Hortmans were remembered as a force of good in their community. And Melissa Hortman was praised by Walz as ""the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history"" and the ""most talented legislator"" he had ever known.
""Maybe it is this a moment when each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for the things we care about,"" Walz said.

""A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did — fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity,"" he continued. ""But let's not do it because of the way Mark and Melissa died. Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led.""
Also amid the attack that killed the Hortmans,
Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot at their Champlin, Minn., home just miles away by the same suspected gunman, but the pair survived, despite sustaining multiple gunshot wounds.
The man accused of carrying out the killings, Vance Boelter, has been
charged
with stalking and murdering the Hortmans, and stalking and shooting the Hoffmans. Boetler is being held in federal custody.
In a statement on Thursday, Boelter's wife, Jenny, sent her condolences on behalf of herself and her children to the Hortman and Hoffman families.
""We are absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided. This violence does not at all align with our beliefs as a family,"" Jenny Boelter said in a statement through her attorney.
""It is a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith,"" she said.
Hortman's assassination is one of the latest attacks on political figures in recent years. In April, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's mansion was
set ablaze
while he and his family slept inside.
Last summer, President Trump was the target of two
apparent assassination attempts
during his run for the White House.
Research shows that Americans are
more polarized
today than they have been in decades, and
threats against
members of Congress have seen a spike.

For President Trump, it's been — to borrow a phrase — one big, beautiful week.
A
favorable Supreme Court ruling
on Friday prompted Trump to hold an impromptu press conference, capping off a high-stakes few days for his presidency.
""It's a really big day,"" he concluded. ""We've had a big week. We've had a lot of victories this week.""
While he touted victories, several matters remain unresolved. What happens over the next 10 days or so, domestically and abroad, could come to define Trump's presidency.
""The president is doing peace deals, tax deals, trade deals,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Capitol Hill earlier this week. ""So he's done a peace deal. I think we'll have the tax deal done by July 4, and then we can finish with the trade deals.""

Hogan Gidley, who served in the first Trump administration and is now a senior adviser to the House speaker, said he couldn't think of a time from the first term that was as momentous as what's happening now.
""Every day, it's just a heart monitor in a hospital. It's like, up and down, up and down all day long,"" Gidley said. ""And I can't come up with a time that was as pressure-filled in the previous administration as we're dealing with right now, although I'm sure there were plenty.""
Here are the wins and challenges for Trump this week:
Win: Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions.
The Supreme Court issued a ruling on Friday that makes it much more difficult for opponents of the administration to put a quick stop to executive actions they say are illegal.
The ruling stemmed from a case about Trump's executive order calling for an end to birthright citizenship in the U.S. While the justices did not rule on whether the order is constitutional, they did say that the nationwide pause on it —
known as an injunction
— was an overreach by lower courts.
Law
Supreme Court limits nationwide injunctions in birthright citizenship order
""This morning the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law,"" Trump said in the White House briefing room Friday.
Trump has faced more than two dozen nationwide injunctions against executive actions on everything from ending birthright citizenship, to halting
refugee resettlement
and freezing federal funding. Now he says the way has been cleared for his administration to push ahead.
Trump and others in his administration argue that lower court judges have been wrongly blocking the president and therefore the will of the American people.

With this decision, the balance of power is now tilted in the president's favor.
More wins: NATO commitments and the Israel-Iran ceasefire
Through the week, the Trump administration had ample praise for the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and the ceasefire between Iran and Israel that followed.
The president is
not budging
from his early assertion that Iran's nuclear program was totally obliterated, and Friday he said he doesn't believe Iran will go back to trying to build nuclear weapons. That, however, is far from certain. Assessments of what was actually destroyed are still underway.

A more unqualified win is what happened at the NATO summit, which Trump attended in the Hague earlier this week. Member states agreed to spend more money on defense, something Trump has long pushed for.
His longstanding
skepticism about the alliance seemed to melt away as a result. It doesn't hurt that at one point the NATO secretary general seemed to awkwardly and perhaps accidentally refer to Trump as ""daddy"" — a moment the Trump White House seemed
unable to let go
.
Challenge: Unfinished trade deals
When Trump punted on his so-called reciprocal tariffs earlier this year, he set a July 8 deadline to get dozens of trade deals done. So far, just one agreement is signed, sealed and delivered, and many more are in limbo.
He announced in a post on Truth Social on Friday that he was halting all trade negotiations with Canada over its new digital services tax, which would affect major U.S. technology companies.
He also said this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with China, but that turned out to be a step forward on a framework, rather than a finalized agreement.
Members of his Cabinet have said for months that deals with other countries such as India, South Korea and Japan were just around the corner.
U.S. vs. China: Inside a great power rivalry
Trump says he's terminating trade talks with Canada, 'effective immediately'
As July 8 draws closer, Trump is wavering. This traffic jam of negotiations is a problem he
created, and with a stroke of his pen, he could change it.
It's hard to tell whether this is strategic uncertainty or just plain old uncertainty.
Chris Whipple, an expert on White House chiefs of staff, said Trump is reactive and instinctive, which drove his success on the campaign trail. But now, he said, the crises are piling up.
""You know, it does feel like kind of a defining moment,"" Whipple said. ""One thing that's clear, six months in, is that shock and awe, so-called, is just not an effective formula for governance.""

Challenge: The fate of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill""
The House has passed Trump's major tax and policy bill, but there
have been speed bumps in the Senate
. That process is ongoing, and it's not clear whether it will pass or whether that version can pass in the House.
Trump wants a bill signing celebration to coincide with Independence Day. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said it would be epic. But planning the wedding before the engagement can be dicey, and it's hard to say at this moment whether Trump will get the party he wants on the date he wants it.

As a reminder, he calls it the ""one big beautiful bill"" because it essentially combines his entire legislative agenda into a single package. Trump has a lot riding on this legislation, not just tax cuts and promises he made like no tax on tips, but also funding for immigration enforcement that he needs in order to keep his pledge of mass deportations.

In a rare decision in June, the U.S. Supreme Court
postponed ruling
on a Louisiana congressional redistricting case that could have implications on legal protections for the rights of minority voters across the country.
The high court's order
on Friday
did not explain why the court wants to hear oral arguments again in
Louisiana v. Callais
during its next term that is expected to start in October, although it signaled there may be details in a follow-up order coming in ""due course.""
""This is on the surface a fairly easy case factually to decide,"" says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. ""The Supreme Court almost never holds over cases for argument. And the fact that it's doing so in this case is puzzling.""

Supreme Court postpones Louisiana redistricting case to next term
Some legal experts are watching to see if the court's ruling ends up joining a
string
of
decisions
since
2013
by the court's conservative majority that have limited the scope of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its protections against racial discrimination in elections.
""Voting Rights Act watchers have been predicting a major shift around the Voting Rights Act for over a decade,"" says Atiba Ellis, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. ""The fact that the Court is rearguing
Louisiana v. Callais
may mean there is deep debate and a potential major decision upholding — or striking down — the Voting Rights Act.""
The Louisiana case also centers on the role of politics when redrawing maps of voting districts, notes Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor. The court's punting in June ""may mean more justices want to think a little bit more about the interaction of race and politics and the Voting Rights Act than I would have thought, but that's not sort of prejudging the outcome of that consideration,"" adds Levitt, who served as a White House adviser on voting rights during former President Joe Biden's administration.
Elections
Under Trump, the Justice Department is stepping away from some voting rights cases
Levitt also points to the court's
2023 ruling
for a similar redistricting case out of Alabama as a sign that the Voting Rights Act may end up unscathed by the court's ultimate ruling in this long-running redistricting battle. In that decision, the court upheld its previous rulings on the same part of the Voting Rights Act that many of its advocates fear could be weakened in the Louisiana case.
As the Voting Rights Act's supporters prepare to mark the
60th anniversary of the law's passage
this August, Levitt, however, does note that its critics are setting up potential future showdowns at the Supreme Court.

Here's what to know about where Voting Rights Act protections currently stand in the Louisiana case and the key lawsuits that could weaken them next:
The Louisiana ruling could make it harder to claim that a voting map dilutes minority voters' collective power
To comply with what's known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers in Louisiana — where voting is racially polarized and nearly 1 in 3 people are Black — are under a federal court order to pass a map with two out of six districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates.
But a group of self-described ""non-Black"" voters challenged the map that the state's legislature said it passed to get in line with Section 2. Those challengers argue that one of the districts the lawmakers drew is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

During
oral arguments in March
, however, Louisiana state Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga
said
the Republican-led legislature made a ""politically rational decision"" to draw a map with a pair of majority-Black districts in a way that protects the seats of three top Louisiana Republicans — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, a House Appropriations Committee member.
With a candidate filing deadline for the state's 2026 primary election
coming up this December
, a
Supreme Court order from last year
keeps the congressional map with two majority-Black districts in effect at least for now.
But voting rights advocates are keeping watch for any ruling by the high court that strikes down the map and potentially further limits how race can factor into redistricting around the country. That could make it harder to enforce Section 2 protections against maps of voting districts that dilute minority voters' collective power in areas where voting is racially polarized.
Alabama wants to again argue against race-based redistricting before the Supreme Court
Republican state officials in Alabama are,
once again
,
appealing
another long-running congressional redistricting case to the Supreme Court.
Sponsor Message
This time, they've teed up an
argument
that it is unconstitutional for Congress to allow race-based redistricting to continue without an end date under the Voting Rights Act.
Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas
raised that point when the high court ruled on Alabama's congressional map in 2023, when Kavanaugh also noted: ""Alabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.""
In that ruling, Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice John Roberts, a fellow conservative, and the court's three liberal justices to
uphold the Supreme Court's past rulings on Section 2
of the Voting Rights Act.
But some voting rights advocates are watching to see if Republican Alabama officials can sway Kavanaugh this round and ultimately undo Section 2 protections against the dilution of minority voters' collective power in redistricting.
GOP state officials in Louisiana have
raised the same constitutional argument
against Section 2 protections in a state legislative redistricting case, which is currently waiting for a ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
A North Dakota case could end a key tool for enforcing minority voters' rights
This month, a
North Dakota state legislative redistricting case
moved a step closer to the Supreme Court, where a potential ruling could eliminate a key tool for protecting the rights of minority voters.
For decades, private individuals and groups have brought most of the lawsuits focused on enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. But a pair of decisions out of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has found that private individuals and groups are not allowed to sue because they are not explicitly named in the words of the Voting Rights Act. Only the head of the Justice Department, these 8th Circuit panel decisions say, can file these types of lawsuits.

Native American voters led by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians asked the full 8th Circuit to review the latest decision. This month, the appeals court denied their request, setting up a potential Supreme Court appeal.
For now at least, the rulings still apply to seven mainly Midwestern states — Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota — as the Justice Department under the Trump administration
steps away
from Section 2 lawsuits it previously brought when Biden was in office.

Some voting rights advocates fear that if the North Dakota case is ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court, the high court could make it harder to enforce Section 2 protections across the country. Justice Neil Gorsuch signaled his interest in this issue with a

A federal judge has struck down President Trump's
executive order
targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, delivering the latest in a series of legal wins for firms that have challenged the president's
punitive campaign
against Big Law.
The ruling Friday from U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan marks the fourth time out of four that a federal judge has permanently blocked one of Trump's executive orders seeking to punish an elite law firm.
Judge AliKhan said in her ruling that the executive order against Susman Godfrey ""is unconstitutional from beginning to end.""
""Every court to have considered a challenge to one of these orders has found grave constitutional violations and permanently enjoined enforcement of the order in full,"" she wrote. ""Today, this court follows suit, concluding that the order targeting Susman violates the U.S. Constitution and must be permanently enjoined.""

""The Court's ruling is a resounding victory for the rule of law and the right of every American to be represented by legal counsel without fear of retaliation,"" Susman Godfrey said in a statement.

Judge accuses Trump administration of trying to undermine judiciary
The latest order delivers a resounding rebuke to Trump's unprecedented series of executive orders targeting prominent law firms since February. The
orders
have
sought
to punish them for representing causes or clients that he opposes, or for once employing attorneys he dislikes, such as former special counsel Robert Mueller.
The orders impose several punitive measures, including suspending security clearances for the firm's attorneys, barring its employees' access to government buildings and officials, and ending government contracts with the firm.
Four law firms — Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Susman Godfrey — individually sued to block Trump's actions, saying the executive orders were unconstitutional and a threat to the legal profession.
Politics
Federal judge strikes down Trump order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie
In all four lawsuits, judges — appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents alike — have found Trump's orders unconstitutional and permanently blocked enforcement of them.
""Let's kill all the lawyers""
In their rulings, the judges found Trump's orders to be an attack on the law firms' First and Fifth amendment rights, as well as a broader assault on the American legal system.
""The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting,"" Judge Richard Leon, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, wrote in his opinion blocking enforcement of the order against WilmerHale.

""The Founding Fathers knew this! Accordingly, they took pains to enshrine in the Constitution certain rights that would serve as the foundation for that independence,"" he added. ""Little wonder that in nearly 250 years since the Constitution was adopted no Executive Order has been issued challenging these fundamental rights.""
That changed, the judge notes, with Trump.
In her ruling in the lawsuit brought by the firm Perkins Coie, Judge Beryll Howell, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, also noted that no American president had ever targeted a law firm with executive orders like Trump has.
Law
Judge blocks Trump from enforcing 'chilling' order against law firm
But, she noted, ""in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.'""
Defending the rule of law
Despite those setbacks, Trump has notched successes with other firms.
At least nine big law firms have cut deals with Trump to either have an order against them lifted or to avoid being the target of one. In return, they've agreed to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono legal work on causes both they and the president support.
Some legal experts, however,
question whether those deals are legally valid
.
Law
Trump's deals with law firms are like deals 'made with a gun to the head,' lawyers say
Timothy Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School, said the Trump administration doesn't appear to care whether the executive orders against the law firms are constitutional.
""As we've seen many firms will capitulate. And if judges invalidate the orders, the administration will just blame 'radical' judges for interfering with the president's agenda,"" he said in an email.
Still, the recent court rulings demonstrate the strength of the law firms' case against the executive orders.
Law
Trump attacks on law firms begin to chill pro bono work on causes he doesn't like
""The firms that cut 'deals' surely knew this, but reasoned that more harm would come from fighting the administration than from capitulating,"" Zick said.
""A big-picture question is how the law firms will be perceived in the future,"" he added. ""Those that litigated may benefit from being perceived as defending not just their own interests but those of the Bar and the rule of law. Those that folded may be perceived as having failed in those respects."""

Middle East conflict
Obliterated? Damaged? Inoperable? What's known about Iran's nuclear facilities
The U.S. military strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites have reignited long-standing debates over Washington's strategy in the Middle East. While President Trump hailed the attacks as a decisive blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions, reactions from regional and international experts reveal a far more divided picture.
Shortly before the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and the war in Gaza, the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia
were in the process of aligning more closely
to counter Iran's regional influence. But the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran marks a shift from shared strategic goals to the coordinated use of military force.
Sponsor Message
Analysts note that while diplomatic alignment has long existed on paper, the airstrikes signal a new phase of direct, operational collaboration.
Throughline
Iran and the U.S., Part One
From calls for regime change to warnings of legal overreach and diplomatic collapse, the strikes have exposed deep fractures in how policymakers and analysts view the path to security and stability in the region.
To understand these competing visions, before and after the ceasefire currently in place between Israel and Iran, NPR's
Morning Edition
spoke to five academics and former diplomats with expertise on diplomacy and the region about what the attacks achieved, what they jeopardized, and what the future might now hold for diplomacy in the Middle East.
Here's what they said:
National Security
John Bolton on intelligence assessments of U.S. strikes in Iran
Only regime change in Iran can bring ""peace and stability,"" according to John Bolton
Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, said he ""wouldn't have terminated the air campaign as soon as Trump did,"" and would've wanted to see Iran placed under intense surveillance.
Destroying Iran's nuclear program, he said, requires ""breaking the links"" in nuclear production and for now he's satisfied with the ""enormous damage"" from these strikes.
Sponsor Message
""The effort to destroy a complex program involves breaking the links in the nuclear fuel cycle at multiple points so that it is ultimately a project of years to put it back together. That's why I'm happy,"" he said. ""I've been spending a long time emphasizing the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan. It was another key link in the process. It has been destroyed.""
Bolton says there's no contradiction in Trump's actions, noting, ""He kind of zigged into doing the right thing, and he zagged back out by terminating it too early. He'll probably zig and zag for the next six or eight months — that's just how he is. He doesn't have a national security strategy.""
Ultimately, though, he said the ""only long term answer to get peace and stability in the Middle East and around the world is to overthrow the ayatollahs.""
World
A former Iranian diplomat on the state of Iran's nuclear program
Only way forward may be direct U.S.-Iran negotiations, former Iranian official says
Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who took part in nuclear negotiations in the early 2000s, highlights the unprecedented nature of the recent attack: Iran was targeted by two nuclear states without the approval of the UN Security Council. He believes the strikes were counterproductive.
""What could be worse than this? How can Iran trust?"" Hossein Mousavian said.
On the question of nuclear weapons in Iran, Mousavian suggests it's a game of narrative and rhetoric used as a cover to justify military actions and regime change: ""They have never been after weapons. This is really a fake and manufactured narrative, like what the narrative they made in order to attack Iraq.""
Like Bolton, he sees a constantly shifting approach from Trump, but he believes that direct negotiations are the only way forward.
""I have proposed there is a need for direct negotiations between Iran and the U.S. I mean, I really don't see any other way because [the International Atomic Energy Agency] proved it is completely helpless,"" Hossein Mousavian said. ""Because by the charter of the IAEA, if a nuclear weapon state is attacking a non-nuclear weapon state, this agency should come to support the non-nuclear weapon state. But they did nothing. I hope President Trump would go for a serious, sincere, comprehensive dialogue and would stop these zigzagging positions.""
Interview highlights
Will Israel-Iran ceasefire hold? Analyst says both sides have strong incentives
Diminished nuclear capabilities may force Iran to reconsider options domestically and with allies, a think-tank analyst says
Jonathan Panikoff, a former intelligence officer who now directs the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, says Iran's military capabilities have been ""severely degraded."" He sees the potential for diplomacy, possibly mediated by Oman, Norway or Switzerland.
""I think that pathway exists, but I think it's going to take quite a lot of cajoling over the coming, frankly, weeks and months,"" Panikoff says. ""You could even imagine, potentially, an outside actor like China trying to convince the Iranians to come back.""
Sponsor Message
Faced with internal struggles, Iran also now faces a new choice, he notes: ""Will it reinvest billions of dollars to rebuild those entities at a time when its economy is struggling, which could lead to even further internal strife? Or will it try a different path, rebuilding some defenses over time, but not reestablishing the same proxy network [of regional military groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza] or nuclear program that has long been a broad threat to the region, including Arab Gulf states?""

The impact of U.S. strikes on Iran in the wider region
The latest U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran push boundaries of international law, Middle East expert says
Vali
Nasr, a Middle East scholar at Johns Hopkins University, notes that U.S. and Israeli military actions in Iran signal that the countries are willing to bypass diplomatic norms and could reshape security perceptions among countries in the region.
He says, ""The regime is still standing,"" and emphasizes that ""the signal here is that the United States and Israel are willing and capable to settle all issues militarily and that international law, rules, diplomacy, et cetera, won't stand in their way.""
Nasr warns this approach will ""have a chilling impact on all countries in the region, be it their enemies or allies,"" fundamentally changing how security is perceived beyond Iran and Israel.

What it's like in Iran as the conflict with Israel continues
Israel exaggerates nuclear threat and war doesn't spare civilians, Iranian academic says
Setareh Sadeqi, a
professor at the University of Tehran's Faculty of World Studies, says Israel's claims about Iran's nuclear program are greatly exaggerated. Sadeqi says that war harms everyone, including innocent civilians.
Sadeqi dismisses Israel's long-standing claim that Iran is ""one month away"" from nuclear capability, arguing, ""While I totally disagree with nuclear weapons, I think if Israel, Pakistan, India, the U.S., France, and other countries have the right to have nuclear weapons, then any other country should also have it, and Iran does not have one.""

When asked if she thinks Iran is innocent, she says: ""And you're saying that Iran has called for the elimination of the state of Israel. Iran has never called for the elimination of a people, but an occupying regime that has stolen land from others and has been a colonial project of the Zionist entity. Many, including the international community, hold it responsible for the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and Lebanese.""
The Israeli government denies accusations of genocide.

which gives lone judges the power to limit executive orders, is seen as a victory for the Trump administration, which will now enjoy a freer hand to implement policy.
Law
Supreme Court limits nationwide injunctions in birthright citizenship order
Friday's
decision
centered on President Trump's executive order stating that children of people who enter the U.S. illegally or on a temporary visa are not entitled to automatic citizenship. Immigrant rights groups and 22 states sued the government over the order. Three federal district court judges struck it down and issued a universal injunction preventing its enforcement.
But instead of ruling on whether president's action on birthright citizenship violated the 14th Amendment or the Nationality Act, the Supreme Court's ruling focused on whether federal courts have the power to issue such nationwide blocks.
Sponsor Message
""Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts,"" the conservative majority said.
Speaking at the White House briefing room after the decision was issued, President Trump called it a ""monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law.""
Here's a look at universal injunctions and how they've been used.
What is a universal injunction?
In short, a universal injunction is a court order that prohibits the government from enforcing a law, regulation or policy against anyone – not just the plaintiffs in a case. It applies nationwide (and is sometimes called a ""nationwide injunction"") regardless of the issuing court's jurisdiction.
""An injunction is an order by a court telling somebody to do something or not do something,"" explains Samuel Bray, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. Usually injunctions protect the parties to the case. But a universal injunction ""controls how the federal government acts toward anyone.""
He says universal injunctions are ""a recent innovation"" and their use has seen ""a meteoric rise over the last 10 years"" in tandem with an increase in executive orders issued by the administrations of presidents Barack Obama, Trump and Joe Biden.
In the past, justices
Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch
and
Samuel Alito
have all criticized universal injunctions, with Thomas referring to them as ""legally and historically dubious,"" and noting that they were rare before the 1960s.
Sponsor Message
In 1937, Congress passed a
law requiring three-judge panels
for cases that challenged federal laws, with those decisions appealable directly to the Supreme Court.
It was designed to limit the power of individual judges to halt New Deal programs and had the effect of streamlining the appeals process. It ""substantially delayed disputes over universal injunctions,"" says Michael Morley, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. This ""expedited path somewhat reduced the likelihood that disputes over universal injunctions would arise,"" he says. But in 1976,
the
law was scaled back.
What does the Supreme Court order mean?
First, the ruling means that using injunctions as a default option to block Trump executive orders is effectively dead.
Groups have used nationwide injunctions to block Trump's
declaration
that the federal government will
only recognize two genders
, and the Department of Homeland Security's departure from a
decades-old policy
that encouraged Immigration and Customs Enforcement
to
avoid places of worship
.
Politics
Trump's executive actions are getting challenged as 'arbitrary.' What does that mean?
The decision today means federal courts can't grant universal injunctions based on fairness, justice, and principles of equity, rather than the letter of the law, says Bray. ""It will remove universal injunctions as the default remedy in a challenge to executive action,"" he adds.
Moving forward, however, the decision will also likely mean that plaintiffs will change the manner in which they bring cases to federal courts.
Next up, class action lawsuits
""The central front in litigation against the federal government is going to shift from universal injunctions to class actions,"" Bray says, because such actions could afford protection to more than just an individual plaintiff.
Morley believes that as a result, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, also known simply as Rule 23, which refers to a legal process for certifying a class action lawsuit in federal court, will be ""the next major battleground.""
In addition to class actions, he says we're likely to see increased use of state plaintiff suits – where a state sues to protect its own interests or its residents – along with organizational standing, which allows groups to sue on their own behalf if directly harmed, and associational standing, which lets organizations sue on behalf of their members if certain conditions are met.

""Despite the ruling today, there are other procedural mechanisms the plaintiffs have already begun to use... to get effectively universal relief,"" he says. ""[T]hese are the next frontiers that the Court's ruling today is going to push these disputes to."""

At issue is the Louisiana legislature's creation of a Black-majority congressional district. A group of voters sued, arguing that the state legislature had unconstitutionally relied on race in drawing new congressional district lines.
Elections
Under Trump, the Justice Department is stepping away from some voting rights cases
Louisiana's population is roughly one-third Black. But after the 2020 Census, the state legislature drew new congressional district lines that provided for only one majority-Black district in a state that has six congressional seats. That's the same thing that Alabama did after the 2020 Census, only to be
slapped down by the Supreme Court two years ago
when a narrow court majority ruled that the state had illegally diluted the Black vote in violation of the Voting Rights Act.
In the wake of that decision, the Louisiana legislature, after losing before multiple courts, saw the handwriting on the wall and drew a new map that provided for a second majority-Black district. But in redrawing the district lines, the Republican-controlled legislature also sought to protect safe seats for two important GOP lawmakers, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise.

Enter a group of voters identifying themselves as ""non-African-American voters,"" who objected to the redistricting as a racial gerrymander.
In oral arguments earlier this year, Louisiana's lawyer told the high court that simply was not the case. It was an old-fashioned political gerrymander, he said, adding, ""We're talking about the Speaker of the House. No rational state gambles with those high-stakes seats.""

A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.
Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development,
according to the Solar Energy Industries Association
, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

America's clean-energy industry is growing despite Trump's attacks. At least for now
Congressional Republicans are

as part of

that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.
Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.
""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term
Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development,
according to SEIA
.
This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.
Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.
Climate
U.S. electricity demand is set to explode. That will make it harder to cut climate pollution
But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018,
Trump approved tariffs
on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent
post on Truth Social
, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.
Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies,
according to the financial firm Lazard
. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.
Sponsor Message
If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""
Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which
announced it was building a Georgia solar factory
in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.
""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""
The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.
""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell
Pakistan
and
Latin America
and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer
Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.
However,
tariffs on their own weren't enough
to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.
Sponsor Message
""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.
But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.
Legislative text
released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.
""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout
The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.
Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to
a study this winter
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.
""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.
Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.
Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.
""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""
Sponsor Message
Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.
Reams' group has
called for lawmakers
to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""
Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.
""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""
With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.
""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese."""

CLARKESVILLE, Ga. — Last September, Alton Fry went to the doctor concerned he had high blood pressure. The trip would result in a prostate cancer diagnosis.
So began the stress of trying to pay for tens of thousands of dollars in treatment — without health insurance.
""I've never been sick in my life, so I've never needed insurance before,"" said Fry, a 54-year-old self-employed masonry contractor who restores old buildings in the rural Appalachian community he's called home nearly all his life.

Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
Now, with a household income of about $48,000, Fry and his wife earn too much to qualify for Georgia's limited Medicaid expansion. And he said he found that the health plans sold on the state's Affordable Care Act exchange were too expensive or the coverage too limited.
In late April, a friend launched a crowdfunding campaign to help Fry cover some of the costs. To save money, Fry said, he's taking a less aggressive treatment route than his doctor recommended.
""There is no help for middle-class America,"" he said.
More than 26 million Americans
lacked health insurance
in the first six months of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The uninsured are mostly low-income adults under age 65, and people of color, and most live in the South and West. The uninsured rate in the 10 states that, like Georgia, have not expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults was 14.1% in 2023, compared with 7.6% in expansion states,
according to KFF
, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Health policy researchers expect the number of uninsured to swell as the second Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress try to enact policies that explicitly roll back health coverage for the first time since the advent of the modern U.S. health system in the early 20th century.

Medicaid changes don't meet Senate rules in 'big, beautiful bill' says parliamentarian
Under the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" — budget legislation that would achieve some of President Donald Trump's priorities, such as extending tax cuts mainly benefiting the wealthy — some 10.9 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034,
according to estimates
by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based on a House version of the budget bill.
A Senate version of the bill could result in more people losing Medicaid coverage with reductions in federal spending and rules that would make it harder for people to qualify. That
bill suffered a major blow Thursday
when the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber's rules, rejected several health provisions — including the proposal to gradually reduce provider taxes, a mechanism that nearly every state uses to increase its federal Medicaid funding.
Sponsor Message
The number who could lose  insurance could rise to 16 million if proposed rule changes to the ACA take effect and tax credits that help people pay for ACA plans expire at the end of the year,
according to the CBO
. In KFF poll results released in June, nearly two-thirds of people surveyed
viewed the bill unfavorably
and more than half said they were worried federal funding cuts
would hurt their family's ability
to obtain and afford health care.
Like Fry, more people would be forced to pay for health expenses out-of-pocket, leading to delays in care, lost access to needed doctors and medications, and poorer physical and financial health.
""The effects could be catastrophic,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Policy-ish
How Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' threatens access to Obamacare
A patchwork system
The House-passed bill would represent the largest reduction in federal support for Medicaid and health coverage in history, Tolbert said. If the Senate approves it, it would be the first time Congress moved to eliminate coverage for millions of people.
""This would take us back,"" she said.
The United States is the only wealthy country where a substantial number of citizens lack health insurance, due to nearly a century of pushback against universal coverage from doctors, insurance companies, and elected officials.
""The complexity is everywhere throughout the system,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, who worked in the George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations. ""The big bug is that people fall between the cracks.""
This year,
KFF Health News
is speaking to Americans about the challenges they face in finding health insurance and the effects on their ability to get care; to providers who serve the uninsured; and to policy experts about why, even when the nation hit its lowest recorded uninsured rate in 2023, nearly a tenth of the U.S. population still lacked health coverage.
Sponsor Message
So far, the reporting has found that despite decades of policies designed to increase access to care, the very structure of the nation's health insurance system creates the opposite effect.
Government-backed universal coverage
has eluded U.S. policymakers
for decades.
After lobbying from physician groups, President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned plans to include universal health coverage in the Social Security Act of 1935. Then, because of a wage and salary cap used to control inflation during World War II, more employers offered health insurance to lure workers. In 1954, health coverage was
formally exempted
from income tax requirements, which led more employers to offer the benefit as part of compensation packages.
Losing health coverage can lead to people getting less care. Kiana George lost Medicaid coverage in 2023 after she got a job at an after-school program that pays about $800 a month. The Camden, Ala., resident stopped her high blood pressure treatment and later landed in an intensive care unit.

Insurance coverage offered by employers came to form the foundation of the U.S. health system. But eventually, problems with linking health insurance to employment emerged.
""We realized, well, wait, not everybody is working,"" said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at the Columbia School of Social Work who studies the impact of social policies on access to care. ""Children aren't working. People who are elderly are not working. People with disabilities are not working.""
Yet subsequent efforts to expand coverage to all Americans were met with backlash from unions who wanted health insurance as a bargaining chip, providers who didn't want government oversight, and those who had coverage through their employers.
That led policymakers to add programs piecemeal to make health insurance accessible to more Americans.
There's Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for people with low incomes and disabilities, both created in 1965; the Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997; the ACA's exchange plans and Medicaid expansion for people who can't access job-based coverage, created in 2010.
As a result, the U.S. has a patchwork of health insurance programs with numerous interest groups vying for dollars, rather than a cohesive system, health policy researchers say.
Sponsor Message
Falling through the cracks
The lack of a cohesive system means even though Americans are eligible for health insurance, they struggle to access it, said Mark Shepard, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. No central entity exists in the U.S. to ensure that all people have a plan, he said.
Over half of the uninsured might qualify for Medicaid or subsidies that can
help cover the costs
of an ACA plan,
according to KFF
. But many people aren't aware of their options or can't navigate overlapping programs — and even subsidized coverage can be unaffordable.
Those who have fallen through the cracks said it feels like the system has failed them.
Yorjeny Almonte of Allentown, Pennsylvania, earns about $2,600 a month as an inspector in a cabinet warehouse. When she started her job in December 2023, she didn't want to spend nearly 10% of her income on health insurance.
But, last year, her uninsured mom chose to fly to the Dominican Republic to get care for a health concern. So Almonte, 23, who also needed to see a doctor, investigated her employer's health offerings. By then she had missed the deadline to sign up.
""Now I have to wait another year,"" she said.

New studies show what's at stake if Medicaid is scaled back
In January, Camden, Alabama, resident Kiana George, who's uninsured, landed in an intensive care unit months after she stopped seeing a nurse practitioner and taking blood pressure medications — an ordeal that saddled her with nearly $7,000 in medical bills.
George, 30, was kicked off Medicaid in 2023 after she got hired by an after-school program. It pays $800 a month, an income too high to qualify her for Medicaid in Alabama, which hasn't expanded to cover most low-income adults. She also doesn't make enough for a free or reduced-cost ACA plan.

Researchers have known for decades that a lack of insurance coverage leads to poor access to health care, said Tom Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.
""It's only more recently we've had really good, strong evidence that shows that health insurance really does improve health outcomes,"" Buchmueller said.
Research released this spring
by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that expanding Medicaid reduced low-income adults' chances of dying by 2.5%. In 2019,
a separate study
published by that nonpartisan think tank provided experimental evidence that health insurance coverage reduced mortality among middle-aged adults.
In late May, the House narrowly advanced the budget legislation that independent government analysts said would result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage and reduce federal spending on programs like Medicaid by billions of dollars.
A key provision would require some Medicaid enrollees to work, volunteer, or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month, starting at the end of 2026. Most Medicaid enrollees already work or have some reason they can't, such as a disability, according to KFF.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended the requirement as ""moral.""
""If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system,"" he
told CBS News
in the wake of the bill's passage.
A Senate version of the bill also includes work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients.
Fiscal conservatives argue a solution is needed to curb health care's rising costs.
The U.S. spends about
twice as much per capita
on health care than other wealthy nations, and that spending would grow under the GOP's budget bill, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank that supports less government spending on health care.

But the bill doesn't address the root causes of administrative complexity or unaffordable care, Cannon said. To do that would entail, for instance, doing away with the tax break for employer-sponsored care, which he said fuels excessive spending, high prices, and ties health insurance to employment. He said the bill should cut federal funding for Medicaid, not just limit its growth, to reduce excessive health care prices and spending.
The bill would throw more people into a high-cost health care landscape with little protection, said Aaron Carroll, president and CEO of AcademyHealth, a nonpartisan health policy research nonprofit.
""There's a ton of evidence that shows that if you make people pay more for health care, they get less health care,"" he said. ""There's lots of evidence that shows that disproportionately affects poor, sicker people.""
Labon McKenzie, 45, lives in Georgia, the only state that requires some Medicaid enrollees to work or complete other qualifying activities to obtain coverage.
He hasn't been able to work since he broke multiple bones after he fell through a skylight while on the job three years ago. He got fired from a county road and bridge crew after the accident and hasn't been approved for Social Security or disability benefits.
""I can't stand up too long,"" he said. ""I can't sit down too long.""
In February, McKenzie started seeing double, but canceled an appointment with an ophthalmologist because he couldn't come up with the $300 the doctor wanted in advance. His cousin gave him an eye patch to tide him over, and, in desperation, he took expired eye drops his daughter gave him. ""I had to try something,"" he said.
McKenzie, who lives in rural Fort Gaines, wants to work again. But without benefits, he can't get the care he needs to become well enough.
""I just want my body fixed,"" he said.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday briefed senators on Capitol Hill. Afterward, several senators emerged and said it was too early to tell the full extent of the damage U.S. bombs had on Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
U.S. airstrikes hit three separate nuclear sites
south of Iran's capital, Tehran on June 21.
A leaked preliminary report from the Defense Intelligence Agency issued not long after the strikes described the damage as ""limited"" and said the strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a matter of months. Trump has responded to media stories citing that report, claiming that Iran's nuclear program was ""totally obliterated"" by the U.S. Despite a lack of evidence, Hegseth and other
top administration officials have stepped in to back the president
.
""President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history,"" Hegseth declared at a Pentagon news conference. ""It was a resounding success resulting in a ceasefire agreement.""
Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said Iran's
nuclear facilities suffered serious damage
, but he didn't provide details. And Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog agency, also said there was significant damage, but he doesn't believe the entire nuclear program was destroyed.

NPR's Steve Inskeep spoke with Kaine further about the Thursday night briefing on Capitol Hill and what Trump could have done, in his opinion, to better and more accurately inform the public about the U.S. attack on Iran.
The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Steve Inskeep:
There is a Defense Intelligence Agency report that said, with low confidence, as they put it, that the military hit Fordo, that they did some damage, but that the Iranians might have moved uranium elsewhere just in time. Is that report that the White House has criticized, in fact, a decent bottom line for what the government knows at this point?
Sen. Tim Kaine
: That report is classified. I read it in a classified setting, and I don't really want to talk about it. But let me just put it in this kind of a context: If the president on Saturday night had said, 'We have taken this action and we've caused severe and significant damage to the Iranian nuclear program,' you wouldn't have seen all this damage control for the last few days.
The president overstated it, in all likelihood. He compared it to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He put up an insulting and juvenile musical video on his Truth Social account with a 'bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran' song. And now you've had the Pentagon try to scramble to assuage his ego — yelling at reporters. They had to postpone the briefing that they gave the senators from Tuesday to Thursday. They had to disinvite Tulsi Gabbard from coming because apparently they didn't like what she might have said. They're scrambling because the president has kind of dislocated his own shoulder by patting himself on the back in some ways that are unrealistic.
Inskeep:
You're criticizing the way the president committed this act of war, but it is a situation where Iran had a nuclear program. It was of grave concern to multiple U.S. administrations and both political parties. And then this situation comes up where Israel had started a war. What would you have done differently if you were the president? Iran does have this nuclear program, and the U.S. did have the available bomb for Fordo, which seems to have been developed just for that purpose.
Sponsor Message
Kaine
: There's two things I would have done differently. First, this war really is sort of on Trump's shoulders because he tore up a nuclear deal that was working, that was limiting Iran's nuclear program even more than these bombs have limited it. This was a program that was working not only in the eyes of our allies and the [International Atomic Energy Agency] but also working in the eyes of Trump's Term One Cabinet — national security team — that said, 'Don't tear up this deal.' It's limiting Iranian centrifuges, limiting enrichment and limiting nuclear research. We had deep inspections into what Iran was doing. But when President Trump tore that up, Iran raced forward. So number one, prefer diplomacy over bombs. And number two, if Israel wants to start a war with Iran, we will help defend Israel. But we didn't need to join this war.
Inskeep:
The White House claims it's going to limit classified information given to Congress from now on because somebody disclosed CIA findings, Defense Intelligence Agency findings, that the president didn't like. Did this subject come up in your meeting?
Kaine
: A member of the Senate asked, 'Are you going to curtail information to us?' And the administration briefers said, 'No, we are not.' But we're still worried about it because the president chose to notify Republican leaders of the strike, but not Democratic leaders. And that is something that no president has done during the time that I've been here."

New York State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani pulled off an astonishing upset this week. In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, he beat out the long-favored winner, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race only hours after the polls closed. The two candidates were of the same party, but held very different positions within it: Cuomo is older, spent more than a decade as Governor, and positioned himself as a law-and-order centrist. Mamdani is younger, newer to politics and a total progressive. This is a primary race in just one city, but it's been making national news and could shake up the Democratic party's strategy post-Trump re-election. Brittany sits down with
Christian Paz

Following nearly two weeks of strikes by American and Israeli forces, there's no doubt that the key parts of Iran's nuclear program have been dealt a blow. But how bad was it? A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency document claims the damage to one site could have been minimal, while the head of the CIA has said that Iran's overall nuclear program had been ""severely damaged."" President Trump, for his part, insists that the program has been destroyed.
""It's called obliteration,"" Trump said at a press conference yesterday in the Hague. ""No other military on Earth could have done it, and now this incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace.""

Here's each of Iran's four main nuclear sites and what's known about their current condition.
Fordo
Loading...
Buried deep inside a mountain, the Fordo fuel enrichment site was the most heavily fortified of Iran's nuclear facilities. The site, which sits under nearly 300 feet of granite, contained thousands of centrifuges which were being used to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade.
American planners had worked for over a decade in preparation for a strike at the site, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters today in a media briefing. Two officers from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency were assigned full-time to searching out the site's vulnerabilities, and sophisticated computer models were used to see how to damage it. ""They literally dreamed about the target at night when they slept,"" Caine said.
Loading...
With Fordo in mind, the Pentagon developed the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-busting bomb. B-2 Spirit bombers carried the weapons to Fordo and dropped them down the ventilation shafts. They exploded in a carefully choreographed sequence, with the goal of puncturing the facility.
It was a perfectly executed strike, Caine said. But penetrating a deeply buried facility like Fordo is
extremely difficult
. Hard rock and irregularities in the geology can prevent the weapons from reaching target depths and can deflect shock waves, says Raymond Jeanloz, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied bunker-busters.
Caine stopped short of saying he believed the facility was ""obliterated"" as President Trump has claimed. ""We don't grade our own homework, we let the intelligence community do that,"" he said.
Outside of the Pentagon, others believe Fordo was significantly damaged by the strike. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission said in
a statement
that Fordo was ""inoperable"" following the strike. And speaking on
French radio
, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he believed the centrifuges at the site were ""no longer operational."" The day after the American strike, Israel
bombed access routes
to Fordo in an effort to delay any return to the facility.
Sponsor Message
David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, says he expects the damage to be ""pretty serious,"" but he adds, ""I think it may be tough to find out what happened at Fordo unless someone goes in.""
Natanz
Loading...
Before the strikes, Iran's primary enrichment site was at a facility in Natanz. The facility had been subject to sabotage and subterfuge by Israel for many years even before these attacks–including a
computer virus
that wrecked the centrifuges over a decade ago.
Partially because it was such a target, Iran moved Natanz's centrifuges into an underground hall in recent years.
Israel attacked the Natanz site on the first day of the war. It destroyed an enrichment facility on the surface known as the pilot fuel enrichment plant. Israeli war planes also struck power and other support facilities for the underground portion of the site. Israel also dropped bombs onto the buried centrifuge hall, although they did not appear to pierce the facility.
On June 22, the U.S. followed up with a strike using two Massive Ordnance Penetrators to hit the underground centrifuge halls.
""That facility was not so deeply buried and I would expect that the underground enrichment halls are also very severely damaged,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey who has studied Iran's nuclear facilities for years.
But Lewis also says that near Natanz, Iran has been digging out an enormous underground facility into the side of a mountain. That facility, whose purpose remains unclear, appears to be intact.
Isfahan
Loading...
Isfahan was Iran's main site where it prepared uranium for enrichment, and converted it into metal after it was done. Putting the uranium into metallic form is a critical step towards building nuclear weapons.
Israel struck the Isfahan site in the opening hours of its offensive against Iran. It destroyed the facility used to convert the uranium into metals, along with several other buildings inside the complex. The U.S. followed up the Israeli strikes with a salvo of dozens of submarine-launched cruise missiles.
""The above-ground facilities are completely destroyed,"" Lewis says. ""Donald Trump could definitely use the word 'obliterate.'""
But like Natanz, Isfahan had tunnels nearby. Those tunnels, which it's believed may have been used to store some of Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium, were hit, but they are thought to be largely in tact.
Arak
Loading...
Most of Iran's nuclear program centered around uranium, but the nation had also built but never started a heavy water reactor that could potentially produce plutonium, another important material for nuclear weapons.
Israel
announced
it had struck the Arak reactor on June 19, destroying its concrete dome and a nearby laboratory. Although the reactor was not considered an active part of Iran's nuclear program, its destruction means Iran will likely never be able to complete it.
""The Arak reactor was not operational, and it's now
really
not operational,"" Lewis says.
The Unknowns
Experts say that, despite these strikes, Iran may still have a significant nuclear capability. Before the attacks, the IAEA assessed that Iran had more than 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that was near bomb grade. That material had been under safeguards, but now, Grossi says, the Iranians have informed the agency that they have taken protective measures, presumably moving the material to an undisclosed location.
The uranium can be stored in containers that are the size of a keg or a scuba tank, says Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""These are easily moveable, they're easily concealable, and as of now, I don't think we can be confident we know where everything is.""
Sponsor Message
In yesterday's press conference, President Trump indicated that he did not believe the Iranians had time to remove anything from the sites. ""I believe they didn't have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,"" he said.
But Albright says the uranium is stored in tough containers that might have survived the strike, especially in the tunnels at Isfahan. ""If there was any in Isfahan, in the rubble, that clearly can be dug out,"" he says.
Lewis adds that he believes Iran has other undisclosed underground facilities that could serve as backups for what's been destroyed. ""I tend to think there are more sites that we don't know about because Iran was always hedging its bets,"" he says.
Ultimately, experts say that the only way to stop Iran's nuclear program for good is to reach some sort of agreement.
""If you really want to have reasonable confidence in a solution over time,"" says Christopher Ford, a former Assistant Undersecretary of State for nonproliferation in Trump's first term, ""you need to have an agreement with some kind of cooperative verification and ongoing monitoring."""

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has spent years spreading doubt about the safety of vaccines and linking them to autism.
Dozens of studies have debunked the theory, but it has nevertheless persisted for years. Part of the reason why may be that autism diagnoses have soared over the last few decades.
Dr. Allen Frances is psychiatrist who led the task force that created the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which expanded the definition of Autism, which he says might have played a factor in that uptick.
Rates of autism have exploded in recent decades.  Could the clinical definition of autism itself be partly to blame?

Even if everyone who is eligible to vote in the country would have voted, President Trump still would have won the 2024 presidential election,
a new study
out Thursday from the Pew Research Center finds.
Trump won in 2024 with just under 50% of the vote, 49.7%-48.2% over Democrat Kamala Harris.
Roughly
64% of the eligible-voting population turned out
in 2024, the second highest since 1904. 2020 was the highest.
But even if everyone who could vote did, Trump would have won by an even wider margin, 48%-45%, according to Pew's validated voters survey.
The survey of almost 9,000 voters was conducted in the weeks after the 2024 presidential election. Pew verified whether they had voted or not over the last five presidential elections using publicly available commercial voter files. For context, most well-conducted national polls include roughly 1,000 interviews.
Sponsor Message
Pew asked non-voters how they would have voted and found they would have broken for Trump, 44%-40%. That's a big change from 2020 and 2016 when they said they would have chosen Democrats. In 2020, they said they preferred Joe Biden 46%-35%. In
2016
, it was Hillary Clinton, 37%-30%.
That upends a longstanding belief in politics that higher turnout generally helps Democrats. Younger and non-white voters, who tend to vote Democratic, are also among the least likely to vote.
But in 2024, Trump's coalition grew – it got more ethnically diverse and younger.
In 2016, almost 9-in-10 Trump voters were white (88%). In 2024, it was 78%.
Meanwhile, Harris' coalition got whiter – 64% of Harris' voters were white compared to 60% in 2016 for Clinton.
Trump was also able to hold more of his coalition from 2020 than Harris did of Biden's. Trump won 85% of his 2020 voters; Harris won 79% of Biden's.
About 15% of Biden's voters did not vote, 5% switched to Trump and 1% voted for someone else. That's compared to 11% of 2020 Trump voters, who sat it out, 3% who switched to Harris and 1% who went for someone else.
Plus, Trump won more of those who didn't vote in 2020 but decided to cast a ballot in 2024. Almost three-quarters of 2020 non-voters stayed home again. But by a 52%-45% margin, Trump won those 2020 nonvoters who voted in 2024.

When looking at all eligible voters, including those who stayed home,

Democrats and ethics experts have questioned the president's involvement in crypto at a time when Congress is working on legislation to regulate the burgeoning industry.

Last month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was ""absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency.""

Senate Republicans hit a major setback in their race to pass a massive tax and spending package on Thursday, as a chamber official ruled against a key Medicaid provision, putting in doubt plans for a vote by the end of the week.
The nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian, who plays a key role in determining what provisions can stay in the fast-tracked bill, said the GOP change to how states can tax Medicaid providers does not adhere to rules for passing the bill with a simple majority. This was a key provision to help offset the costs of the bill's tax cuts.
Sponsor Message
Senate Republicans a day earlier had proposed a $15 billion rural health stabilization fund to address the slashing of a provider tax that is a critical source of funding for many states.
Democrats, who are making arguments before the parliamentarian to slash key sections of the bill, called the ruling a win.
""With more decisions to come, this guidance results in more than $250 billion in health care cuts removed from the Republicans' big bad bill,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. ""Democrats fought and won, striking health care cuts from this bill that would hurt Americans' walking on an economic tightrope.
""This bill is rotten to its core, and I'll keep fighting the cuts in this morally bankrupt bill until the end,"" Wyden added.
Multiple Republican officials familiar with the discussions told NPR that Republicans will continue to rework some provisions to address the parliamentarian's guidance. Republicans are also downplaying the significance of the setback and the framing by Democrats.
Medicaid provisions have been among the most complicated provisions to negotiate in the bill. One issue is a directive Senate Republicans added that states cut and freeze the tax they impose on Medicaid providers from the 6% in the House bill down to 3%, effectively halving the amount that states will receive in tax revenue from those providers. Critics say the change will result in major challenges for rural hospitals that rely on that money because it becomes part of a big pot of tax revenue for states that plays into the complex formula that determines how much federal funding is received as part of the joint program run with states.
Sponsor Message
Other provisions were flagged by the parliamentarian, including one barring Medicaid from covering gender affirming care and denying coverage to some Medicaid recipients who are not U.S. citizens.
Senate Republicans had hoped to begin voting on the legislation this week, but it's unclear if they'll meet their deadline to send it to President Trump's desk by the July 4th deadline. They are also facing intense pressure from Trump to pass the bill this week, and several members of the conference are due for a White House meeting today.
Despite the new guidance from the parliamentarian, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump's July 4th goal remains in place.
""The President is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day,"" she said during a briefing at the White House Thursday afternoon.
When asked whether Trump thinks the parliamentarian should be removed, Leavitt said she had not spoken with the president about that and would ""let him speak on it.""
""He knows this is part of the process and the inner workings of the Senate,"" she added. ""He remains very much engaged in these conversations and in this process with lawmakers in both the Senate and the House side, and the whole White House does as well.""
The stakes are high for both Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, given that the legislation carries the bulk of the president's domestic agenda. The GOP leaders have has struggled to resolve major sticking points. While Senate committee leaders have made several significant changes to the bill in recent days, the issue of funding for rural hospitals emerged as a major roadblock.
The new Medicaid language was added to the House-passed bill in the Senate, drawing objections from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee put out the compromise stabilization fund that would direct $15 billion over a 5-year period to states in need. However, that fell short of what other senators say was needed.
Sponsor Message
Collins has said the fund needed to be closer to $100 billion, and warned colleagues from racing to a vote this week without carefully resolving the issue. Hawley has argued the Senate changes would force drawn-out negotiations with the House, delaying final passage of the legislation. Tillis, who is running for reelection in 2026, served in the state house in his home state before coming to Congress and warned states wouldn't be able to make up the gap in funding due to the new cuts in the bill.
After the GOP conference discussed the setback from the parliamentarian during a luncheon on Thursday, Hawley said leaders are reconsidering their options.
""I think that Senate leadership is trying to decide what direction exactly they want to go in,"" he told reporters.
But when asked for more details, Hawley wasn't sure.
""I don't think they know, it sounded to me like it was very fluid,"" he said.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., told NPR that he believes there is a path to keeping a provider tax in the spending bill.
""[The parliamentarian] had a technical issue with it. And we've got a technical response,"" he said, although he did not specify what was modified. ""We think it'll be addressed. It could change timelines a little bit. So you may see some change to it, but generally we think it was a technical issue with a technical fix.""
Hoeven also said that he believes the floated stabilization fund for rural hospitals will be upwards of $15 billion.
Senate GOP leaders are also waiting for a determination of whether major tax provisions in the bill meet the strict rules for what can be included. The parliamentarian is still reviewing those elements to make sure each has a direct impact on the budget, among other regulations. Several other provisions in the House version, such as one barring nationwide judicial injunctions, have already been cut in that review.

There is also lingering debate over the fate of energy tax credits in the bill, changes to the safety net program for low-income families known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or snap and a provision on public lands.
Senate Republicans are also navigating differences with House GOP lawmakers who represent districts in New York and California who insist they need to preserve a state and local tax break, known as SALT. That section of the bill was negotiated with House Speaker Mike Johnson for their constituents who pay high state and local taxes.
Senate Majority Leader Thune can only afford to lose three GOP votes in order to pass the bill.
Fiscal hawks in the Senate, such as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have raised concerns about new deficit spending and could both potentially vote against the plan as a result.
However, even if Thune is able to resolve all of the issues in his chamber, several different factions of House Republicans are warning they will oppose the latest bill that's emerging from the Senate. Thune has repeatedly called Trump the ""closer"" for the massive legislation, and he's betting political pressure from the White House will force Republicans to back the package.

Republicans are facing a conundrum.
They want to cut taxes with their ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" But the tax cuts they want will explode the federal debt. So they've been looking for spending cuts. One big area where they want to slash: Medicaid, which provides
over 75 million Americans
— including low-income families, seniors and disabled people — with health insurance.
The conundrum: Medicaid is
widely popular
, including among many Republican voters in their now more working-class coalition forged by President Trump.
So how can they cut Medicaid while sheltering themselves from the political fallout of cutting Medicaid?
Sponsor Message
Their answer: work requirements. Draft versions of the bill have
included provisions
that would force millions of working-age, able-bodied adults to work to receive Medicaid — and every six months show the government proof they work to remain on the program.
It's sort of a brilliant answer politically because, on the face of it, the idea that able-bodied adults should have to work to receive government benefits is
widely popular
. Sure, progressives argue that health care should be a right available to all. But conservatives argue
these
requirements are necessary to fight ""waste, fraud, and abuse."" And, more broadly, that work requirements incentivize people to work and prevent able-bodied, working-age people from freeloading off of hard-working Americans. Some argue that work requirements may even help this nonworking population, pushing them to find gainful employment and achieve greater prosperity for themselves or their families. There is some
peer-reviewed economic evidence
that suggests kicking people off of government health insurance programs can encourage them to work more.
"" I certainly think it's reasonable to impose work requirements for Medicaid,"" says Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Corinth says he supports Medicaid and also the many work-requirement exemptions found in the One Big Beautiful Bill, including for disabled people, children and the elderly. As for those who can work, he suggests, they should work, and he thinks ""there is a pretty good chance you'll see real employment gains"" if work requirements get implemented. This nudge to work, he says, could ultimately prove to be beneficial for many in this population.
Sponsor Message
However, a
growing amount
of
evidence
suggests that adding work and other eligibility requirements to social programs fails to do much to actually encourage work. The majority of people who use these programs
already work
. Or, if they don't work, it's often because they're disabled or elderly or children or have issues that adding work requirements to a government program won't usually help with.
One of the biggest sources of cost savings from work requirements may not come from eliminating benefits for those who aren't working. Instead, studies suggest that, in practice, work and other eligibility requirements achieve a lot of savings in a sort of sneaky way. It's that the eligibility requirements themselves create a bureaucratic rigmarole that many
who are eligible
for benefits struggle to navigate. A
ton of them
get lost in the maze of paperwork and get kicked off the program. Call it the paperwork trap (h/t to
Planet Money
's Erika Beras for helping coin this term).
In economics, this sort of red tape that makes it harder for people to do or get something is known as ""administrative burdens"" or ""ordeals"" (although the behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
offer
a more fun name for it: ""sludge"").
A back door for cutting the social safety net?
Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy, is a leading scholar of administrative burdens.
"" Bureaucracies can often generate administrative burdens inadvertently,"" Moynihan says. ""But they can also be deliberately created by policymakers who want to reduce the cost of programs by making it more difficult for people to access them.""
The federal government has a wide variety of social programs that vary in difficulty to prove eligibility and obtain benefits. Moynihan points to Social Security as a program that's more easily accessible, so a much higher percentage of people eligible for it actually use it. Almost all American seniors are eligible for Social Security and the government makes it almost automatic to receive benefits, which is why
nearly 100%
of those eligible get it. On the other end of the spectrum are programs like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), an old-school welfare program that was reformed under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Programs like these have stricter eligibility requirements, and they're more difficult to sign up for because people have to prove their eligibility (like, for example, proving how much they make). That results in these programs having a much lower participation rate.
Sponsor Message
There's a growing mountain of evidence on the effects of administrative burdens. (For a good summary of this literature, check out
this recent essay
in the
Journal of Economic Perspectives
from Moynihan and his co-author Pamela Herd).
As an example, Moynihan points to what happened in Arkansas after it became the first state to adopt work requirements for Medicaid in 2018. A
2019 study
published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
found that these work requirements failed to boost employment rates much or at all within the first year after they were implemented. Meanwhile, the authors found that thousands of Arkansans who did work or who qualified for exemptions — because, for example, they were disabled or elderly — were kicked off the program.
Moynihan says it's
a similar story
with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), more commonly known as food stamps. He says SNAP already has work requirements (which Republicans want to beef up in the One Big Beautiful Bill), and
evidence shows
that
existing requirements
haven't done much to encourage work. They mostly just make it harder for people to get food assistance. In fact, evidence suggests that SNAP work requirements have the biggest effect on those least able to work,
according to Yale scholars Chima Ndumele and Jacob Wallace
.
""The largest effect of work requirements isn't actually to incentivize people to work,"" Moynihan says. ""The largest effect is to get people who are working and put them in a situation where they're caught in this administrative trap that they simply can't get around. And so they tend to lose benefits even though they are actually fulfilling the requirements. It's the paperwork that catches them.""
If we humans were the perfectly rational creatures of old-school economic theory, these types of administrative burdens wouldn't do much to trip us up. Back in the early 1980s, economists
theorized
these ""ordeals,"" as they called them, could even be beneficial, serving as an efficient way to target benefits to those who want or need them the most.
Sponsor Message
However, a lot of newer research, especially in behavioral economics, points to how our cognitive quirks and limitations may prevent us from doing what's in our best interests. For example, we may procrastinate and fail to fill out the necessary paperwork in time. We may suffer from ""present bias,"" valuing our time now more than our well-being later. We may not even know we have to fill out forms to get benefits or even about these benefits at all.
Studies
suggest
that
low-income
populations have
a harder time
dealing with these administrative burdens. They are often living paycheck to paycheck. Sometimes they're homeless. Sometimes they have disabilities or
chronic diseases
. They may have inflexible work schedules or not have a computer. They may have life stresses and struggles that
lower their mental bandwidth
, and it's hard for them to dedicate the time and effort to satisfy requirements even though they meet the criteria for assistance.
Kevin Corinth acknowledges that red tape can cause problems and force some legitimate beneficiaries to fall through the cracks. But, he says, the reality is ""work requirements are popular, especially among Republicans, but even among many Democrats."" And enforcing those requirements necessarily entails some red tape, as much as he hates it.
Draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill have left some discretion to the states when it comes to setting work requirements and how Medicaid recipients have to prove their compliance with them. Corinth argues that states should invest time and effort into ""making it as easy as possible to demonstrate compliance, so people can focus on complying as opposed to the actual paperwork part of it."" He suggests administrative burdens can be minimized and not be extremely onerous.
Moynihan, however, suggests that administrative burdens might be the point. He suggests that politicians have learned to use administrative burdens as a sneaky way to cut popular social programs. It gives them more political cover. They can claim that they're not really cutting these programs. They're just making sure the right, deserving people get them. But, in effect, they swamp potential beneficiaries with paperwork and other hassles and make it more difficult to get benefits. Some significant percentage gets caught in the spider web of paperwork and, boom, the government reduces how much it spends under the program.
Sponsor Message
That's basically what Moynihan sees in the draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill. He says it could prove to be the largest cut to Medicaid we've ever seen — even though many Republicans are claiming that they're not really cutting it, just ""reforming"" it (although there have been
some Freudian slips
when making that claim). The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan budget agency, estimates that the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill would cut Medicaid spending by
almost $800 billion
over 10 years. And, Moynihan argues, they're ""doing it through the backdoor mechanism of simply making it harder for people to maintain coverage through these administrative requirements."""

Jim Obergefell's husband, John Arthur, didn't live to see the day when same-sex marriage was legal and recognized in all 50 states.
Yet, Arthur played a key role in making it happen.
""John deserved to die a married man,"" Obergefell, the plaintiff in
a landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage
, said in an interview with
Morning Edition
's Leila Fadel.
Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the Supreme Court handing down its
Obergefell vs. Hodges
ruling that states could not deny marriage to same-sex couples like Obergefell and Arthur.
Arthur had been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, two years prior. Obergefell and Arthur, who had been together for over 20 years, never believed they could get married, but in 2013, when the Supreme Court partially struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the two realized that could change.
Sponsor Message
""We had talked about marriage early on in our relationship back in the mid-'90s, but we finally had this opportunity to get married and to have the federal government recognize us,"" Obergefell said.
By then, Arthur could no longer walk or move most of his body, which made it difficult for them to travel to a state where same-sex marriage was legal. So friends and family donated over $10,000 for a medically equipped plane to get the couple to Maryland to be married on the tarmac of the Baltimore Washington International airport.
""For the past 20 years, 6 months and 11 days, it's been love at every sight"" Obergefell said during their marriage vows.
The 2013
United States v. Windsor
ruling
only required the federal government to recognize same sex marriage conducted by states and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. That meant that while the federal government recognized Arthur and Obergefell's marriage, their home state of Ohio, didn't recognize their Maryland marriage.
Obergefell discussed how his legal fight for marriage equality began, the future of LGTBQ+ rights in the United States, and reflected on the 10-year anniversary of
Obergefell v. Hodges
.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Obergefell:
This fight isn't something I ever dreamt I would do. But it's surprising what you are willing to do and where you can find the motivation and the courage to do something. John, my partner of almost 21 years, was dying of ALS, and it wasn't until the Supreme Court struck down the Federal Defense of Marriage Act with their decision in
United States vs. Windsor
, that we finally had this opportunity to get married. And that's what we did.
All we wanted to do was spend John's remaining days as husband and husband. But then because a local civil rights attorney in Cincinnati heard our story, he reached out and said, I would like to meet. And in that meeting, he pulled out a blank Ohio death certificate and said, ""Do you guys understand? Do you get it when John dies? His last record as an Ohioan, his last official record as a person will be wrong because your word says marital status at time of death. Ohio will say he was unmarried. And Jim, your name won't be listed as his surviving spouse.""

And that's because you were only married in Maryland where the state recognized it.
Obergefell:
Correct. But we were lawfully married in Maryland. And we deserve to have our marriage recognized by the state we called home. John deserved to die a married man. We simply wanted dignity. And that's what motivated us to say, yes, let's fight the state of Ohio. And that's what led to that filing in federal district court. And that's what took me all the way to the Supreme Court. We wanted to exist.

Fadel:
And today, in the court of public opinion, I mean, LGBTQ+ marriages are accepted. They're part of life now. It's been 10 years since that case. What has changed in that decade?
Obergefell:
Well, you know, I love that it has changed from that perspective. A majority of Americans support marriage equality. And I love the fact that there are queer kids. Over the past 10 years, they've grown up in a world where the only future they see includes the right to marry the person they love no matter what happens. And, you know, there are other things happening in our country that aren't so wonderful for the queer community.
Fadel:
I want to talk about that. We're also in a moment in which a lot of rights groups, LGBTQIA+ communities are worried about the rollback of the very rights that you fought for. The administration has targeted LGBTQI+ services and monuments, like cancelling the LGBTQ+ service hotline, removing Harvey Milk's name from a ship. There are state legislations and battles over legislation around gender affirming care for transgender youth and whether that should be banned or not. There are schools banning books often related to race, racism, LGBTQ+ communities. What is it like to look at that? As you think about this anniversary.
Obergefell:
In one word, it's terrifying to see all of these attacks on the queer community, especially the most marginalized and the most vulnerable part of our community, the trans community. These are people who want nothing more than to be authentically who they are and to be able to live their life without apology and without fear. But the entire queer community and in fact, all marginalized communities are under attack under this administration. So it is terrifying. There are moments I'm incredibly scared about what the future holds. But then I remind myself, we have been through these things before. We've been through worse times as a community and what have we done? We have always raised our voices to say we exist, we are here. We're not going to put up with that. And that's what we will keep doing. But I know these days there's just the added fear, because in the past when we stood up, you know, the people at Stonewall, all of those people in the past who stood up, they were doing that to gain rights. And what we're experiencing now, what we're facing now is the likelihood of losing rights that we have gained over the past. And that makes this just a much more fraught time for our community, because it isn't like we're just fighting to gain rights. We are fighting to maintain and hold on to the rights we have gained over the decades.

You know, of course, I think about my late husband, John, and I wish that we had had more than three months as husband and husband. I wish that we had any time together as a couple where we could know that our state or our government, the federal government, wasn't trying to erase our existence. So I always think of John.
I also think about this young woman at the University of Tennessee who told me that if it weren't for marriage equality, if it weren't for a lawsuit, if it weren't for a Supreme Court decision, she would have committed suicide. And the fact that this one person told me that I know there are others who felt the same way, but she found a reason not to take her own life. She found a reason to keep living because she finally, as a closeted queer kid, saw a future that included her. So that's what I think about constantly. It reminds me of just how important and meaningful this decision is and the hope that it gives to people. And I just keep moving forward knowing that all we can do is use our voices and work hard to be included with the people.

The Trump administration official running the parent agency of the Voice of America defended her efforts to shut it down at a hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, at one point insisting — without evidence — that the Chinese Communist Party has more influence than American values over the federally funded network's news coverage.
""Hopefully, we can root out the Russian, Chinese, Iranian propaganda that has been prevalent on our airwaves at VOA, and we're going to work to do that,"" U.S. Agency for Global Media senior adviser, Kari Lake, told members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""Some say it's the Voice of anti-America.""
Sponsor Message
Asked about foreign journalists working for the Voice of America and other U.S-funded networks who face peril — several reporters are
currently imprisoned by authoritarian regimes
— Lake suggested that was a problem for the networks, not the federal government.
""The safety and security of American journalists is important ... and I don't think they've done enough to protect them,"" Lake said. ""The question is: Why aren't we hiring more Americans?""
""That's sort of like blaming the group that's advocating for these people,"" Massachusetts Democrat Bill Keating shot back. ""What are they doing? I'll tell you what they're doing - they've simply asked for a meeting with you to discuss this issue!""
Network chiefs have said they have been unable to get Lake to meet with them to hear out their concerns. Lake oversees their federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, for President Trump, and she has served as an outspoken advocate for his positions on a series of wide-ranging issues.
Foreign journalists are typically hired because they know other languages and cultures in addition to having skills as broadcasters and reporters, according to public accounts from past Voice of America officials who have served under presidents of both parties. The U.S. Agency for Global Media must try to hire U.S. journalists with such knowledge first, but it often proves hard to do so, they say.

Michael Abramowitz, currently on indefinite leave as Voice of America's director, called her claims of Chinese influence ""ludicrous"" and unfounded. He said the Chinese authorities hate Voice of America and have no influence over the network.
""VOA has reported extensively and critically — across multiple languages — on the [Chinese government's] activities both within China and around the world,"" Abramowitz said in a statement shared with NPR. ""Congress should ask Ms. Lake to provide proof for the mystifying allegations that were made at the hearings."" Abramowitz is among the agency staffers currently
suing Lake and the agency
.
Many in the foreign policy establishment and journalism hail Voice of America's importance, and not simply for broadcasting to countries that were ruled by the Nazis or part of the Soviet Union. In the current moment, Lake has sought alternately to dismantle it or strip it of editorial independence enshrined in law. She put nearly the entire Voice of America workforce on leave earlier this spring, firing hundreds of contractors. On Friday, she
sent termination notices
to 85% of the permanent employees.
Lake also sought to revoke Congressionally mandated grants to the other federally funded networks, which include the nonprofits Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. After adverse rulings in the courts, she has since agreed to comply with delivering the promised funds, but they have been notably slow in coming.
Lake has relished conflict over the matter and finds herself at the center of the fray twice this week: with the Congressional hearing Wednesday on the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and in court hearings over her leadership of it.
Suspicions of foreign workers
The twin proceedings represent the polar extremes of official Washington's take on the Voice of America. At Wednesday's House hearing, Lake broadly accused the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the Voice of America of security so lax that they had been infiltrated by foreign spies.
Sponsor Message
The hearing, arranged by Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, a Trump ally, took inspiration from claims that improper vetting caused security breaches in the hiring of foreign journalists to report for the networks funded by the agency.
Lake claimed that foreigners were abusing a visa system set up to allow journalists from abroad to work at the Voice of America's foreign-language news services for several years. She also slammed the firewall enshrined in U.S. law that protects the newsroom from direct editorial influence or pressure by federal lawmakers.
Voice of America staffers — including some of those who are currently suing her — rebutted some of her claims even before the hearing started and continued to do so during it. For example, security concerns had been identified under President Barack Obama and during Trump's first term; remedies were taken under President Joe Biden.
Lake's arguments echoed those of Trump's pick five years ago as U.S Agency for Global Media chief, Michael Pack, who cited the same security concerns. Pack tried to fire holders of the same specialized J-1 visas in 2020, but internal documents released subsequently showed they were driven by an America First outlook, rather than any foreign infiltration.
""USAGM must prioritize employment for American citizens,"" Pack's chief of staff
wrote at the time
. ""When employers trade American jobs for temporary foreign labor, it reduces opportunities for U.S. workers.""
An inspector general's report
exonerated six agency executives
suspended by Pack in 2020 over related allegations of security lapses.
At the hearing, lawmakers split along fairly conventional party lines: no Republicans criticized Trump's executive order that called for the agency and the networks it funds to be boiled down only to the specific operations that Congress explicitly specified, such as the Persian language service. Many GOP lawmakers also affirmed Lake's claims of waste and liberal bias.
Sponsor Message
Even so, several Democrats seemed open to reconsidering whether the U.S. Agency for Global Media was the best federal parent for the networks; Lake has advocated it be eliminated and that any surviving services be put under the State Department. And Democrats invited Lake to consult further with Congress over which technologies would be best to distribute the services in the age of livestreaming.
No Democrats, however, signed onto her call to replace the networks' hundreds of journalists with a reliance on posts on Elon Musk's social media platform X or podcasts like that of Joe Rogan, as Lake suggested.
Media
Kari Lake says OAN's far-right coverage will fuel Voice of America
Several Republicans on the committee joined Democrats in highlighting the importance of Voice of America's work in China, Iran, Myanmar, Armenia and elsewhere. And Democrats dressed down Lake for taking an absolutist approach in eviscerating the networks without careful study first. Lake endorsed Trump's push to have the agency eliminated in the next fiscal year's budget.
Also on Wednesday, Senate appropriators held a
hearing about broader clawbacks
of funds allocated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, still the senior Republican senator from Kentucky, affirmed the importance of the sort of American ""soft power"" that the networks were established to promote, although he did not refer to them by name. Soft power, he said, was much less expensive than going to war.
Indeed, after the Israeli and U.S. bombing raids on Iran, Lake called some employees of Voice of America's Persian and Dari-language networks back to work, albeit without rescinding termination notices. Two Voice of America staffers say that Iranian relatives of some Persian-language journalists have been threatened by authorities. NPR agreed to grant them anonymity given the fear of retribution.
Judge weighs lawsuits over Lake's moves
On Monday, U.S. Senior District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered federal lawyers for the agency and Lake to explain by Friday how it is complying with his order to keep Voice of America alive.
Sponsor Message
""What would be the purpose of Voice of America if there was no voice?"" Lamberth asked,
according to the Associated Press
. The larger case is caught up in the appellate courts, where Lake and the government
won a reprieve
from much of his order that she freeze her actions to dismantle the services.
World
Trump tried to shutter Radio Free Europe. The EU threw it a lifeline
Lake said she had been paying the nonprofit networks in a timely way — an assertion they dispute. The Middle East Broadcasting Networks have all but shut down; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia have engaged in mass furloughs as they seek to survive.
While Voice of America officials acknowledge some missteps over time, as occurs at all news outlets, it has historically sought to promote American democratic values by offering coverage of pluralistic political debate inside the U.S., featuring criticism of U.S. government policy along with official statements.
In a series of posts, former Voice of America acting director Elez Biberaj
wrote
that Lake's statements ""reflect a sweeping, ideologically driven attempt to dismantle the Voice of America based on broad, unsubstantiated claims.""
""This decision doesn't just gut a vital institution,"" Biberaj, a 43-year-veteran of the service before his retirement ,  also
wrote
. ""It is profoundly harmful to our national interests, undermines key foreign policy objectives, weakens our credibility abroad, and threatens the mission that VOA has pursued for decades: to report the truth, tell America's compelling story to the world, and promote its democratic values."""

Since that strike, several Iranian officials have openly talked about continuing the country's nuclear program – which Iran maintains is peaceful, but which Israel says was aimed at building a nuclear bomb – particularly in regards to enriching uranium, a key component for a nuclear weapon.
""President Trump has to find a way in which to get back to the nuclear negotiating table as quickly as possible,"" says Vali Nasr, Iran specialist and professor at Johns Hopkins University.
Nasr stressed that time is not on the side of the U.S. right now.
""The Iranians may already be busy building a bomb, having realized that they were just invaded by two nuclear armed countries, and that, ultimately, you know, the only choice to face such a threat is nuclear weapons,"" he says.
Iran can rebuild
Experts have long warned that attacking Iran could have the opposite effect to what its adversaries want – instead of deterring its nuclear ambitions, it could speed them up.

Why America's giant bunker-busting bombs may have failed to reach their target
""I've been making this point for at least 30 years, that all that matters is reconstitution,"" says Kenneth Pollack, vice president for policy at the Middle East Institute, talking about the rebuilding of Iran's nuclear program.
Pollack says there simply isn't a way it can be curtailed through military action alone.
""No matter how many scientists the Israelis kill, they're not going to be able to assassinate Iran back to nuclear ignorance. The knowledge is just too widespread within the Iranian system,"" he says.

He points to the fact that there is still so much about Iran's nuclear program that is unknown, especially after the most recent hostilities, including where a large stockpile of highly enriched uranium might be.
Rafael Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
indicated on Monday
that there's a chance it survived the attacks, having been moved by Iran ahead of time -- but said that the nuclear watchdog currently has no accounting of it.
Iran has limited its interaction with IAEA inspectors for several years, although they were still allowed to monitor declared nuclear sites. On Wednesday, Iran's parliament recommended a bill that effectively suspended cooperation with the agency. On Thursday, the country's Guardian Council fully approved it.
Iran has made clear that the suspension does not mean it will pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but it will prevent IAEA inspections of Iran's bombed nuclear facilities.
""The Iranian regime has invested decades in its nuclear program and also an unparalleled amount of resources,"" says Stroul, of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""So to think that after less than two weeks, they are just going to take a knee and abandon their entire nuclear ambitions is likely a short sighted approach.""
Talks won't be easy
Trump has signaled that U.S. and Iranian officials will be meeting next week.
Shira Efron, director of research at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group, says this is good news, if true.
""An agreement would deliver something far more sustainable than the ceasefire that we have,"" she says. ""The question is, what's going to come out of these talks? They can't be talks just for the sake of talks.""
Those talks, if they happen, are almost certainly going to be complicated, given the extremely technical nature of the nuclear issue, and the hardened positions on both sides.
Sponsor Message
""This is the real test for the art of the deal, right?"" says Nasr, of Johns Hopkins. ""Do you actually have the diplomats with the authority to negotiate, to do the heavy lifting? Do you have the right team to do that? It's not only intention, it's the capacity to deliver.""
Geranmayeh, who consulted during the diplomatic track that led to the 2015 nuclear deal under Obama, says in some ways that deal helped lay a pathway for talks today. But without international inspectors having access to Iranian facilities, she says it would be hard to know what exactly to negotiate about now.
""Even though we basically know what the solutions are and how you can put the Rubik's Cube back together, the technical side has become more difficult,"" Geranmayeh says.
Like putting a Rubik's Cube back together blindfolded, she says."

Michelle Obama has lived a lot of her adult life under immense scrutiny, which meant carefully thinking through every word she uttered in public.
But she is in a place in her life now where she gets to integrate her public and private self a little more. And that means saying ""no"" to some of the things that are expected of her, like attending President Trump's inauguration, or former President Jimmy Carter's funeral. She knows that those decisions were scrutinized in the press. ""Whatever the backlash was,"" she says, ""I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn't regret it.""

Interview highlights
On the scrutiny she got for not attending Carter's funeral or Trump's inauguration.
Michelle Obama:
One of the major decisions I made this year was to stay put and not attend funerals and inaugurations and all the things that I'm supposed to attend. That was a part of me using my ambition to say, ""Let me define what I want to do, apart from what I'm supposed to do, what the world expects of me."" And I have to own that. Those are my choices. Whatever the backlash was, I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn't regret it, you know? It's my life now, and I can say that, now. But we'll see. Maybe next year, we sit down, I'll go, ""You know, Rachel, I went a little too far."" [laughs]
Sponsor Message
On the divorce rumors that spread in the wake of her not being at the inauguration.
Obama:
The fact that people don't see me going out on a date with my husband sparks rumors of the end of our marriage. It's like, ""OK, so we don't Instagram every minute of our lives. We are 60. We're 60, y'all. You just are not gonna know what we're doing every minute of the day.
On feeling like she has never been able to realize her own ambition because she has always put family first, and how now she has the chance to for the first time in her life.
Rachel Martin:
Has ambition ever led you astray?
Obama:
I don't know if my ambition has ever fully been able to actualize itself because of the nature of what me and my husband have done.
Martin:
As a team. It wasn't about your individual ambition.
Obama:
Right. It was the team ambition. And I went along, arguably kicking and screaming, right? And you know, I think I'm now at a stage in my life where all my choices are mine. Now I can say that whatever I'm doing from this point on is about my ambition.
And that's fairly new, right? Because as a working mother, I – you know, I think all of that stuff, it kind of cut my ambitions short a little bit. Because I had to make a set of decisions: ""OK, my husband's over here, I've got these kids over here. I don't know if I can afford to be ambitious right now. So I have to take a step back."" Even though ambition is there, I can see where I can make more money, I could do that. But, you know, I got these little kids that I love. And I do wanna go to the Halloween parade, and I wanna – you know?
Sponsor Message
So I think I kind of squelched my ambition. But now is a time for me to embrace my own ambition and to define it for me. So maybe the answer is, ""We'll see."" Because I think I'm just now stepping, fully stepping, into my own ambition. And right now, I have not regretted it.

On reflecting on death.
Martin:
How often do you think about death?
Obama:
My husband thinks this is morbid, but at 61, you know, if I am lucky, if I am truly blessed, I have like 25 more summers. If you're not mindful about time, like – we've been out of office for 10 years. What happened? [laughs] What happened in those 10 years, you know? I mean, I did a lot, right? I mean, two, three books, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There's a lot that happened, but [snaps] it went by fast.
And I'm at the stage of life where I want the next 10 years to go by slowly. Because guess what? I love life. I love my life. I love life. But what I feel is that if I'm not mindful about it, the years slip away. And you wind up spending a year doing what? Did you do anything you wanted to? Did you spend time with the people that you wanted to spend time with, doing the things that you wanted to do? And there's a time in life for all young people where you just don't have that luxury 'cause you're grinding and growing and building. You haven't earned it yet. And you should be out there doing and shaking and baking.
But with 25 more summers, I wanna feel each one of them. I wanna be like, ""Woo, this year. Woo. This was slow."" It's like, ""I didn't do much of anything. Did I accomplish anything? I got bored. I read another book. Ugh, it took forever…""

I want these last 25 summers to feel long and purposeful and mine. Not because I've given that time away and I've looked up and it's all gone. I've given it all away to everybody else. And I don't even know what was left for me. And so I think all of that is a part of thinking about death.

And I was like, ""But you can't, you're stuck with me."" I could just take care of her. And she got better and went back to Chicago.
But we were sitting on the couch watching one of her court shows 'cause she liked court shows. And she was realizing that, you know, she will not ever be the same old self that she was.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — NATO's summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday has been described as ""transformational"" and ""historic."" ""We're witnessing the
birth of a new NATO
,"" Finland's President Alexander Stubb said.
World
At NATO, President Trump defends his Iran strikes and warms to the alliance
The 32 members of the world's biggest security organization endorsed a plan to massively ramp up defense spending, ""back to the defense expenditure levels of the Cold War,"" as Stubb put it, driven by U.S. President Donald Trump and fears of the security threat posed by Russia.
Here are some of the takeaways from the
two-day meeting
in The Hague.
Tens of billions of dollars in new military spending
The nonbinding spending agreement means a steep budget hike for NATO's European members and Canada that will cost them tens of billions of dollars.
Sponsor Message
It's a major revamp of the way NATO calculates defense spending. Until now, the allies had set a target of 2% of gross domestic product for their defense budgets. Now they'll be aiming for 3.5% by 2035.
They'll now be able to include weapons and ammunition they supply to Ukraine in the equation, making the new target slightly easier to reach, but still difficult for Canada and a number of European countries with economic troubles.
On top of that, the allies will dedicate 1.5% of their GDP to upgrading infrastructure — roads, bridges, ports and airfields — needed to deploy armies to the front. Money spent on protecting networks or preparing societies for future conflict can be included.
Progress will be reviewed in 2029, after the next U.S. presidential election.
Not everyone is on board. Spain officially refused the agreement. Slovakia had reservations. Belgium, France and Italy will struggle to meet the new target.

A Trump commitment to collective defense
The leaders reaffirmed their ""ironclad commitment"" to NATO's collective defense clause,
Article 5
. In recent years, Trump had sowed seeds of doubt about whether the U.S. — NATO's most powerful member — would come to the aid of any ally under attack.
Trump had appeared to condition that support on higher defense spending. With NATO's new spending pledge in the bag, he told reporters that ""I left there saying that these people really love their countries. It's not a ripoff. And we're here to help them protect their country.""
Sponsor Message
He added that ""they want to protect their country, and they need the United States, and without the United States, it's not going to be the same.""
A sidelined Ukraine
After Russia invaded Ukraine by launching the
biggest land conflict
since World War II in 2022, NATO summits have largely focused on providing support to Kyiv. This summit was different.
Previously, the emphasis was on Ukraine's membership prospects and on bringing it closer to NATO without actually joining. But the final summit statement this time made no such mention.
Instead, the leaders underlined ""their enduring sovereign commitments to provide support to Ukraine.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was at the venue. He dined with other leaders at the Dutch king's residence, held talks with several leaders and spent half an hour or so with Trump.
NATO's plan was to focus the meeting only on Trump's pet cause, defense spending. Foreign ministers did meet on the sidelines with their Ukrainian counterpart in an official NATO-Ukraine Council.
In a minor win for Ukraine, and for allies needing to persuade citizens that their governments must spend more on defense, Russia was identified as the standout of the ""profound security threats and challenges"" facing NATO.

A ""nice group of people""
If there were doubts that the United States runs NATO, the summit removed them. A very shortened summit and one-page statement were prepared to keep the U.S. president happy and focused.
As Trump flew to the Netherlands, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte sent a
text message
gushing about him being on the verge of a great achievement and saying, ""Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win.""
Trump posted the message on social media. Rutte said he wasn't embarrassed and that it was all true.
After the meeting, Trump said he came to the summit seeing it as a political chore, but he was leaving convinced that the assembled leaders love the alliance, their own countries and, mostly importantly, the United States.

The Trump administration on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Donald Trump's executive powers.
The remarkable action lays bare the administration's determination to exert its will over immigration enforcement as well as a growing exasperation with federal judges who have time and again turned aside executive branch actions they see as lawless and without legal merit.
""It's extraordinary,"" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said of the Justice Department's lawsuit. ""And it's escalating DOJ's effort to challenge federal judges.""
Sponsor Message
At issue is an order signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III and filed in May blocking the administration from immediately removing from the U.S. any immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The order blocks the removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the habeas corpus petition is filed.
Politics
The Trump administration is making an unprecedented reach for data held by states
The administration says the automatic pause on removals violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president's authority to enforce immigration laws.
The Republican administration has been locked for weeks in a growing showdown with the federal judiciary amid a barrage of legal challenges to the president's efforts to carry out key priorities around immigration and other matters. The Justice Department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking the president's agenda, accusing judges of improperly impeding the president's powers.
""President Trump's executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,"" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Wednesday. ""The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.""
Sponsor Message
A spokesman for the Maryland district court declined to comment.
Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. That led to an extraordinary statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said ""impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""
Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who has called the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador illegal. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have asked Xinis to impose fines against the administration for contempt, arguing that it ignored court orders for weeks to return him to the U.S.
The order signed by Russell says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government ""fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.""
National
From the fringes to the mainstream: Meet the hard-line anti-immigration activist who helped shape Trump's agenda
In an amended order, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that ""resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.""
The Trump administration has asked the Maryland judges to recuse themselves from the case. It wants a clerk to have a federal judge from another state hear it.
James Sample, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra University, described the lawsuit as further part of the erosion of legal norms by the administration. Normally when parties are on the losing side of an injunction, they appeal the order — not sue the court or judges, he said.
On one hand, he said, the Justice Department has a point that injunctions should be considered extraordinary relief; it's unusual for them to be granted automatically in an entire class of cases. But, he added, it's the administration's own actions in repeatedly moving detainees to prevent them from obtaining writs of habeas corpus that prompted the court to issue the order.
Sponsor Message
""The judges here didn't ask to be put in this unenviable position,"" Sample said. ""Faced with imperfect options, they have made an entirely reasonable, cautious choice to modestly check an executive branch that is determined to circumvent any semblance of impartial process."""

Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Committee pushed back against the Trump administration's bid to
kill $9 billion in federal funding that Congress already has approved for public broadcasting and international aid programs.
In President Trump's request to Congress, sent last month, he justified the cuts because the targeted foreign aid programs were ""antithetical to American interests,"" and because ""[f]ederal spending on [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting] subsidizes a public media system that is politically biased and is an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.""
In a hearing Wednesday, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who chairs the committee, noted in the case of public broadcasting that 70% of the federal dollars targeted for rescission support local programming and emergency communications. She acknowledged concerns about NPR's news coverage, which she said ""for years has had a discernibly partisan bent.""
Sponsor Message
""There are, however, more targeted approaches to addressing that bias [at NPR] than rescinding all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,"" Collins said.
In response to a later question, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought testified that emergency broadcasting services funded by CPB would be safe. He also argued that because the CPB rescission doesn't apply to the current fiscal year, local stations would have ""ample time to adjust"" and ""they should be more judicious"" about whom they pay for content.
Upon further questioning by Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has come out against the public broadcasting cuts, Vought committed to working with her on funding for rural stations. Yet he reiterated that Republicans have spent years trying to address public funding of content.
Murkowski later gave what she described as
""a little bit of a bird's eye view"" of the public radio situation in Alaska, which includes rural stations that receive up to 70% of their funding from the federal government. She went on to detail the vital services the station supply. ""[A]lmost to a number, they're saying that they will go under if public broadcasting funds are no longer available to them,"" she said.

The vast majority of the $9.4 billion in cuts requested by the White House are to foreign aid programs addressing global public health, international disaster assistance and hunger relief.
But the package also includes a cut of nearly
$1.1 billion in funding for 2026 and 2027
for CPB. The private nonprofit sends most of that money to local public television and radio stations across the country. PBS receives about 15% of its annual revenue through CPB, while NPR gets about 1% directly. Indirectly, NPR also receives some of the money going to member stations, who pay the network to air its programs.
The rescissions measure narrowly passed the House earlier this month,
214 to 212
, with two key Republican lawmakers switching their votes from ""no"" to ""yes"" at the last minute to get it over the finish line. The House held a hearing earlier this year at which many Republicans accused PBS and NPR of being woke and biased against conservative viewpoints.
On Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the panel's top Democrat, questioned the legality of the White House's
request.
Under the 1974
Impoundment Control Act
, both chambers of Congress must approve such a request by a simple majority within 45 days of its submission—in this case, by July 18.
The cuts to CPB would ""rip away funding that supports over 1500 local public TV and radio stations,"" Murray said.
""Rural communities will be the hardest hit, not to mention our kids,"" she said, adding that the cuts threaten ""free, high-quality programming that is thoughtfully developed to get our kids thinking and to grow their curiosity.""
NPR in a statement said: ""There is no substitute for the direct support and nationwide infrastructure and services funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that enable these noncommercial stations to serve their communities."" In a statement after the House vote this month, PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger said: ""Our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress, support we have earned by providing services that cannot be replaced by commercial media.""
Sponsor Message
In one exchange during Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Murray pressed Vought, saying that public broadcasting and the global HIV/AIDS program known as PEPFAR —an initiative begun in 2003 by President George W. Bush — have both enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.
""Do you believe Congress has been wrong all these years to support them?"" she asked.
""
I think what's changed is the nature of how these programs are being implemented,"" Vought replied. ""While I respect that they once had bipartisan backing, the facts we've uncovered show funding being diverted to advocacy and social engineering projects that I don't believe reflect the values of the American taxpayer. We're not against medical aid—we're against the misuse of funds under misleading labels.""
With Democrats united against the bill, the White House can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes. Yet, several Republicans on the committee voiced doubts about the choice before them.
Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell voiced concern over cutting foreign aid programs. He noted that ""at a very low cost"" the U.S. had ""built some pretty good relationships, particularly in countries in the Middle East that certainly wouldn't be described as democratic.""
""Reforming the way we invest in peace and stability is certainly worthwhile. And there's plenty of absolute nonsense masquerading as American aid that shouldn't receive another bit of taxpayer funding,"" he said. ""But the administration's attempt to root it out has been unnecessarily chaotic. In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you've created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill.""
Collins was among several senators who expressed frustration with the administration over the rescission request. ""What is unusual here is to have a rescission sent up without consultation with the committee that applies to funding that was in the continuing resolution which the president signed into law,"" she said, adding that the ""legitimate examples"" of waste all dated to the Biden administration.

Senate Republicans are racing the clock, trying to meet President Trump's demand that they pass his domestic agenda bill by July 4th as they work to resolve major sticking points inside the GOP conference.
While Senate committee leaders have made several significant changes to the bill in recent days, the issue of funding for rural hospitals has emerged as a major roadblock.
Senate GOP leaders are also waiting to learn if major tax provisions in the bill meet strict Senate rules for what can be included in the bill and still pass with a simple majority vote. The Senate parliamentarian — a non-partisan member of the body's professional staff — is still reviewing those elements to make sure each has a direct impact on the budget, among other regulations. Several provisions in the House version, such as one barring nationwide judicial injunctions, have already been cut in that review.

Senate Republicans' changes to 'big beautiful bill' tee up clash with House
Senate leaders initially hoped to release their bill early this week. But the debate over hospitals, taxes and other issues are threatening to undermine Senate Majority Leader John Thune's goal of passing the bill before the week is done.
Thune can only afford to lose three GOP votes in order to pass the bill.
The fight over Medicaid and rural hospitals
Medicaid — which provides health coverage to low-income people and is one of the largest payers for health care in the United States — has been among the most difficult provisions in the bill. At issue is a directive that states cut the tax they impose on Medicaid providers from 6% down to 3%. Critics say that tax is an important part of the funding equation in many states. They say the change will result in major challenges for rural hospitals that rely on that money. It is part of a complex formula that determines how much federal funding is received as part of the joint program run with states.
Mehmet Oz, Trump's director of the agency overseeing the Medicaid program, met with Senate Republicans last week and defended the need to crack down on how states finance Medicaid. He called the bill ""the most ambitious health reform bill ever in our history.""
Sponsor Message
He argued the changes will curb the growth of the program and add new work requirements that will preserve the program for the most vulnerable.
But Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has argued that President Trump negotiated the House bill and the changes would force the Senate to enter into drawn-out negotiations with the House.
Hawley noted that his legislation to provide health care to those impacted by exposure to radiation from the testing of atomic weapons was included in the package. ""But they have to have a hospital to go to,"" he added. ""So it's a problem.""
In an effort to win over Republicans like Hawley, the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday put out a new compromise to set up a stabilization fund to help rural hospitals. The plan would direct $15 billion over a 5-year period to states in need. However, that falls short of what other senators say is needed.
Policy-ish
Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins has said the fund needs to be closer to $100 billion. She told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday that provisions that ""are far more draconian than the House are problematic"" and said leaders should work this out carefully rather than rushing towards a vote this week.
""Well, I would prefer that we take more time and try to sort through these extremely complicated issues,"" she said.
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. has also warned that adequately addressing the issue would be very costly.
""I think if you examine it further, you're probably going to have to go much more than what people are anticipating if you really want to preserve rural access,"" Tillis told reporters earlier this week.
Tillis, who is running for reelection in 2026, served in the state house in his home state before coming to Congress and warned states wouldn't be able to make up the gap in funding due to cuts in the bill. ""If you got a $38.9 billion cut estimated in North Carolina over 10 years, you're going to have to repeal expansion and do a number of other things to get the books in order. I'm just saying, people need to just go in with their eyes open.""
Sponsor Message
Majority Leader Thune acknowledged Republicans needed to find a way to address concerns from several Senators. He said the discussions have been underway for several days to ""ensure that the impact on rural hospitals be lessened — be mitigated.""
Other divisions remain
Other Republicans are concerned about the overall impact of changes to Medicaid resulting in major cuts in the rolls in their states — which would mean shifting costs to states to cover those low-income, elderly and disabled patients who rely on the program.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is one of a group of conservatives who are pressing for deeper spending cuts in the bill and told reporters he met with the president recently. He said he wants to pass a bill, but ""we've got to have to have fiscal sanity.""
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., continues to say Congress needs to roll back spending levels to pre-pandemic levels, and that the legislation adds to the deficit.
Fiscal hawks in the Senate have also raised concerns about the fate of energy tax credits. Republicans chose to roll back or end many of the credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed under President Biden in order to find more cost savings. But that plan has frustrated even some in their own party who say constituents and businesses are already using those credits and would be negatively affected if they are eliminated.

House GOP plan to gut green energy tax credits meets resistance in Senate
Even if Thune is able to resolve all of the issues in his chamber, several different factions of House Republicans are warning they will oppose the latest bill that's emerging from the Senate.
The tax debate also includes a side negotiation with House GOP lawmakers who represent districts in New York and California who insist the Senate needs to preserve a state and local tax break, known as SALT, that was negotiated with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for their constituents who pay high state and local taxes.

They have threatened to vote against the bill if it clears the Senate without the break intact.
Most Senate Republicans have ignored their threats, and the issue isn't a priority with no Senate Republican representing the blue states that are affected.""
Referring to the so-called ""SALT caucus"" in the House, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., told reporters the Senate will come up with the bill they believe is the best deal.
""They're still going to decide whether they agree or not. I think there'll be a lot of pressure because, look, will produce a good product for them to just go ahead. But they get to make that call.""
On Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he had spoken with nearly all of SALT caucus, and that while they were getting closer to a deal, he speculated that it's unlikely ""we're going to get to a place that everybody loves … But we're going to get someplace that may be palatable for people.""
He added that once lawmakers reach an agreement on SALT and changes to Medicaid, they will be ""good to go.""
""All of us have some concerns with the bill,"" Mullin said. ""But that's what happens when you're negotiating the bill in here and you get 535 opinions.""
Thune has repeatedly called the president the ""closer"" when it comes to rallying support for the massive legislation, and by moving ahead with the timetable Trump has set, he believes political pressure will, in the end, force Republicans on both sides of the Capitol to back the package."

Zohran Mamdani is poised to become the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor,
after leading
in the city's ranked-choice primary on Tuesday.
The 33-year-old state assemblymember and democratic socialist was virtually unknown when he jumped into the crowded primary field last fall. But he had recently skyrocketed in the polls, fueled by in-person interactions, viral videos and policy proposals that appear to have resonated especially among younger and first-time primary voters.
""I think everyone is stunned and shocked by the unexpected nature of his victory,"" says Patrick Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University. ""And I think one of the other notable things about that victory is that he won with a really progressive, liberal left-wing platform of the kind that we probably haven't ever seen in New York.""

With 93% of precincts reporting, Mamdani garnered 44% of ballots — the most of the 11 candidates and far more than the 36% of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the one-time frontrunner. Cuomo
conceded to Mamdani
on Tuesday night, but has left the door open to run as an independent in November's general election.
Politics
Zohran Mamdani set to defeat Cuomo in NYC mayoral primary upset
The primary isn't officially over: The losing candidates' ballots must be redistributed to voters' second-choice candidates until one of them breaks the 50% threshold, a process that is set to begin on July 1.
But Mamdani's commanding lead sent a clear message — and was enough for him to declare victory just after midnight.
""I will be the mayor for every New Yorker, whether you voted for me, for Gov. Cuomo or felt too disillusioned by a long, broken political system to vote at all,""
Mamdani told supporters
at his Long Island City watch party. ""I will fight for a city that works for you, that is affordable for you, that is safe for you.""
If Mamdani does win the primary, he will face off against a slew of candidates in November — including Republican nominee
Curtis Sliwa
, who ran unopposed in his party's primary, and
embattled
Mayor Eric Adams, who bypassed the Democratic primary by announcing he'd seek reelection
as an independent
.

But Mamdani's rise was far from guaranteed: With the help of tens of thousands of unpaid volunteers, the Ugandan-born progressive mobilized young and first-time voters to pull off a stunning upset against the Democratic Party establishment in America's most populous city, with implications for the rest of the country.
Seth Masket, a politics professor at the University of Denver, says many Democrats — in New York City and beyond — are feeling disillusioned with the party, in the wake of its 2024 election losses and after seeing the response to President Trump.

""I think you can tie this into a little more of a vibe that's going on across the country where a lot of Democratic voters seem to be souring on the party's leadership, the party's establishment, and are looking for unusual different voices to lead them going forward and certainly a younger set of leaders,"" he says. ""And Mamdani certainly fills that role.""
Here's what else to know about him.
He would be a history-making mayor
If elected, Mamdani would be New York City's first Muslim mayor. He would also be its youngest in more than a century.
Politics
Arab and Muslim voters helped deliver Michigan to Trump. They're not all happy so far
Mamdani, who turns 34 in October, would share the honor with John Purroy Mitchel — nicknamed the ""
Boy Mayor
"" — who took office at age 34 in 1914.
Mamdani was born and raised in Kampala, Uganda, to academic Mahmood Mamdani and Indian-American
filmmaker Mira Nair
, who is best known for films including
Mississippi Masala
and
Monsoon Wedding
.
The family moved to New York City when Mamdani was seven years old, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2018.
Mamdani would also be New York City's first mayor to
meet his wife
on a dating app, as he revealed on
The Bulwark
. He married Syrian animator and illustrator Rama Duwaji
in a civil ceremony
at the City Clerk's office in early 2025.
He was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020
After graduating from Bowdoin College with a degree in Africana Studies, Mamdani worked as a foreclosure prevention housing counselor in Queens — a job he says inspired him to run for office.
""After having spent every day negotiating with banks that valued profits over people, he came face-to-face with the reality that this housing crisis – one which predated this pandemic – was not natural to our lives, but instead a choice,"" reads Mamdani's
official biography
.
Politics
Young men swung for Trump in 2024. Democrats are working on a plan to win them back
Mamdani won a seat in New York's State Assembly in 2020 after narrowly beating a four-term incumbent in the primary, becoming the first South Asian man to serve in that body. He has represented the 36th district — which includes the Queens neighborhood of Astoria — ever since, winning reelection unopposed in 2022 and 2024.
Mamdani's legislative — and campaign —
priorities include
affordable housing, free public buses and lowering the cost of living by raising taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers.
He introduced
more than 20
such bills during his four-plus years in Albany, though the
New York Times
notes that only three ""relatively minor items"" actually became law. One of his signature achievements was a yearlong
pilot program for free bus routes
— one in each of the city's five boroughs — that was not renewed.

NYU's Egan says Mamdani will enter the general election as a ""favorite, but certainly not a sure thing."" Even if he does win, he will face questions about his agenda.
""If Mamdani ends up being mayor of New York, can he translate these big, bold and arguably pretty expensive policies into practice lothat will improve the lives of everyday New Yorkers?"" Egan says. ""That, of course, is his promise. And if it's the case that he's able to succeed, then the Democrats have notched a win in their attempts to be the good governing party that they hope to be.""
But he also cautions against drawing too much from Mamdani's primary performance.
""I think it would be a mistake for either observers or party leaders to say, 'Oh, this has to be the recipe that's going to fit all elections, all constituencies,'"" Egan says. ""Because it looks like there are a lot of different ways that Democrats can be successful, as both politicians and as when once they're governing in office.""
He was endorsed by high-profile progressives
In the final weeks of the primary race, Mamdani scored endorsements from Democratic Rep.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
— whose congressional district includes parts of Queens — and Sen.
Bernie Sanders
, I-Vt., who congratulated him and ""his thousands of grassroots supporters"" in a tweet on Tuesday night.
""You took on the political, economic and media Establishment- and you beat them,""
Sanders wrote
. ""Now it's on to victory in the general election.""
Mamdani's
roster of political endorsements
also includes figures like Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y., former New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, New York Attorney General Letitia James, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.
In addition to the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, Mamdani was endorsed by organizations including the New York Working Families Party, the national youth climate group Sunrise Movement, and multiple local unions.

Notably, Mamdani was cross-endorsed by some of his fellow Democratic mayoral hopefuls, former Assemblymember Eric Blake and New York City Comptroller
Brad Lander
, with whom he formed a
public alliance
in the hopes of keeping Cuomo off voters' ballots.
Masket of the University of Denver says the dynamics of ranked-choice voting — and that alliance — seem to have worked in Mamdani's favor.

""It did seem to allow for the organization and cooperation between different candidates who were not Cuomo,"" he says.
Lander was in third place in the race as of Tuesday night, poised to deliver a sizable share of votes to Mamdani.
His views on Israel have been divisive
Mamdani — who co-founded his college's first Students for Justice in Palestine chapter — has been a vocal critic of Israel's military response to the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, an issue that has
deeply divided
the Democratic Party.
While mourning the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives, Mamdani condemned Israel's decision to cut electricity to Gaza and the occupation
in a statement
the day after the attack on Israel, which he
later called
a ""horrific war crime."" But critics, including some Jewish groups, have pointed to
Mamdani's track record
on Israel even before Oct. 7.
It includes his
long-standing support
of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement (he's
declined to say
whether he would advocate for the policy as mayor), and a 2023
bill he drafted
that would prohibit New York nonprofits from supporting Israeli settler activity. The legislation was
widely criticized
by Democratic lawmakers — who called it ""a ploy to demonize Jewish charities"" — and did not pass.
Middle East conflict
As Israel turns its focus to Iran, the death toll mounts in Gaza — and hunger deepens
Mamdani further stirred controversy the week before the primary when, in an interview with
The Bulwark
, he refused to condemn the phrase ""
globalize the intifada
"" — which many Jewish people interpret as a call for violence against them and Israel, even as some pro-Palestinian protesters say it is a peaceful call to resist Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.
When asked whether the slogan made him uncomfortable, Mamdani said it captured ""a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.""
After his comment was condemned by the
U.S. Holocaust Museum
and other Jewish leaders, Mamdani told reporters that ""it pains me to be called an antisemite.""

""I've said at every opportunity that there is no room for antisemitism in this city, in this country. I've said that because that is something I personally believe,"" he said.

""I get messages that say the only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,"" he said. ""I get threats on my life, on the people that I love."""

Matthias Schrader/AP
President Trump used a press conference at the NATO summit Wednesday to expand on his insistence that U.S. strikes heavily damaged Iran's nuclear operation, despite
a preliminary U.S. intelligence report that said it was
a more limited impact.
""It was very, very successful,"" he told reporters at the NATO summit in The Hague. ""It was called 'obliteration.' No other military on Earth could have done it.""
The press conference came as the world watches to see whether a
ceasefire between Israel and Iran
will endure. Citing that ceasefire, Trump compared his bombings to the nuclear bombs that helped end World War II.
Sponsor Message
""It was so bad that they ended the war. It ended the war,"" he said. ""Somebody said, in a certain way, that it was so devastating, actually, if you look at Hiroshima, if you look at Nagasaki, you know, that ended a war, too. This ended a war in a different way, but it was so devastating.""
Trump traveled to the summit the morning after announcing that ceasefire, which came days after the United States
joined Israel's attacks on key Iranian nuclear facilities
. The
early classified U.S. intelligence assessment
said the strikes set Tehran's nuclear program back ""a few months.""
Trump said he did not dispute the Defense Intelligence Agency's initial assessment — but said it was only an early look at damage caused by U.S. strikes on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities, including one called Fordo, built inside a mountain. He slammed U.S. news outlets, specifically naming CNN and the
New York Times
, for their reporting on it. Battle damage assessment can take many days or weeks.
He cited a statement from the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, which said that U.S. strikes had ""set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years."" Later in the day, the CIA bolstered that assessment, concluding U.S. airstrikes ""severely damaged"" Iran's nuclear program. The CIA — which rarely issues public statements on such sensitive matters — noted that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt ""over the course of years.""
Sponsor Message
Like Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth excoriated the media from the lectern in The Hague for their reporting on the U.S. intelligence assessment, calling it ""spin"" aimed at hurting the president. ""They want to spin it to try to make him look bad based on a leak,"" Hegseth said.
""If you want to make an assessment of what happened, you better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated, and somebody, somewhere is trying to leak something to say, 'Oh, with low confidence, we think maybe it's moderate,' "" he said.
Trump said his thinking on NATO changed at the summit
At the summit, NATO allies agreed to
commit 5%
of their GDP to defense spending by 2035, up from 2%. Trump has long called for allies to boost their spending, saying that the United States was paying more than its fair share. The U.S. contributes
about 3.5% of its GDP to NATO
.
Politics
Pentagon says Iranian nuclear capabilities are 'devastated' after U.S. strikes
Before the summit, Trump told reporters that the new goal wouldn't apply to U.S. spending. ""They're in Europe. We're not,"" he said. And he also expressed some ambivalence to Article 5, the mutual defense clause in the NATO treaty that says an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, adding to long-held fears among European allies that Trump would not back them in the event of an attack.
At the press conference, Trump seemed to suggest the NATO summit had changed his thinking.
""I came here because it was something I'm supposed to be doing, but I left here a little bit different,"" he said. He later added, ""I left here saying that these people really love their countries. It's not a rip-off, and we're here to help them protect their country.""
Immediately prior to the press conference, Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump said they did not discuss a ceasefire in that country's war with Russia.

""I just, I wanted to know how he's doing. He was very nice, actually,"" Trump said. ""I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin, see if we can get it ended.""
He later added that he has not been able to end that war yet, in part because Putin is being ""difficult.""

The White House describes
Emil Bove
as an ideal nominee for a position on the federal courts.
And that's exactly what critics fear.
Bove spent years as a federal prosecutor, registering convictions and generating complaints about his work before he left to defend Donald Trump through four criminal indictments. More recently, he's had a hand in some of the administration's most aggressive
moves at the Justice Department
.
As its top official responsible for daily operations, he was involved in sacking prosecutors and
FBI agents
who investigated Trump and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. In a recent move, he walked away from the corruption case against New York City Mayor
Eric Adams
.
Sponsor Message
Now,
Bove is President Trump's nominee to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a region that covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands. His nomination hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee included no critical words from Senate Republicans, suggesting he could have a smooth path to confirmation in the GOP-led Congress.
""There is a wildly inaccurate caricature of me in the mainstream media,"" Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday at his confirmation hearing for the role. ""I am not anybody's henchman.""
He added: ""I categorically reject any claim of unethical or inappropriate behavior by me.""
His nomination hearing offered Senate Democrats an opportunity to question him about upheaval inside the Justice Department this year, as well as complaints about his temperament and decision-making during his tenure as a federal prosecutor.

But his nomination also could represent a pivot point in Trump's approach to the judiciary.

If confirmed, Bove, 44, will enjoy a job with substantial autonomy and lifetime tenure.

The White House sees the nominee differently. Spokesman Harrison Fields praised Bove's legal skills and said he should be a ""shoo-in"" to become a circuit court judge.
""The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly,"" Fields said in a written statement.
Bove's nomination has prompted several critical letters from Democrats. And on Tuesday, a day before his confirmation hearing, a whistleblower
filed a formal complaint
alleging Bove planned to knowingly defy court orders and withhold information from judges about the administration's deportation agenda.
""I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,"" Bove told lawmakers.
But he also refused to answer multiple questions about his work inside the DOJ, citing legal privileges that Democrats cast as dubious.

Influence of Federalist Society
During his first term in office, Trump's White House confirmed more than 200 federal judges, working hand-in-hand with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the Federalist Society.
But Trump has since clashed with judges who have moved to block some of his top priorities, including remaking the federal workforce and moving quickly to deport immigrants.
Analysis
Clash between Trump and the courts sparks questions of a constitutional crisis
Trump has chafed at the influence and advice of the right-leaning Federalist Society and its former leader Leonard Leo, upon whom Trump relied in his first term to name hundreds of judges.
Bove is not a member of the Federalist Society, and is the highest-level pick out of a crop of judicial nominees the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering this week.
Interview highlights

Trump posted on social media last month that Leo was ""a real 'sleazebag'…a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.""
Mike Davis, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and a conservative legal activist, has been pressing Trump to make bolder picks for the courts in his second term.
""The days are over of FedSoc picking milquetoast judges who care more about what their liberal friends at their country club think than what the law and the Constitution actually say,"" Davis said in a written statement.

Biden made diversifying the federal bench a top priority. Here's a look at his legacy
From law clerk to prosecutor to personal lawyer
Emil Bove has an extensive track record. He graduated from Georgetown University Law Center and went on to prestigious jobs clerking for two different federal judges, appointed by President George W. Bush. As a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, he rose to help lead the unit that prosecutes accused terrorists and drug kingpins.
Among the cases he handled were ones against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and against Cesar Sayoc, who sent bombs to prominent Democratic politicians and entertainment figures he considered to be Trump's enemies.

But Bove's work in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) also prompted a number of complaints and critiques.
The office abandoned a conviction it won in a sanctions case after a judge found severe prosecutorial misconduct, including failures by Bove and others to properly supervise the trial team, which did not turn over material that would have been helpful to the defendant.

text of his letter
made public this week by Democratic lawmakers.
Seven Senate Democrats said they're concerned about a pattern of potentially unethical conduct and abusive behavior. They've asked for any paperwork about any internal or external complaints about Bove during his time in the U.S. Attorney's office, in light of how powerful a position a federal judgeship presents.
""Mr. Bove's record of alleged abuse of power, ethical lapses, dishonesty, and unstable, abusive behavior during his tenure as a federal prosecutor warrants a thorough review of his employment history at SDNY by members of the Judiciary Committee,"" wrote Sens. Cory Booker,
Peter Welch, Mazie Hirono, Sheldon Whitehouse, Richard Blumenthal, Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla.

Bove said he understood there were questions about his temperament if he's confirmed as a judge and told senators he would be ""tough but fair.""
""I'm not perfect,"" Bove said. ""I do learn from mistakes. I take constructive criticism seriously.""
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined comment.
Senate Democrats' opposition could influence public opinion but is unlikely to block Bove's confirmation in a Republican-controlled Senate, as long as all Republicans stick together to support him; the president's nominees are confirmed on a simple majority vote.

None of the GOP members who appeared at the hearing offered criticism of Bove. Indeed, several of those senators congratulated him and said they looked forward to his confirmation.

Efforts to reshape Justice Department
The new whistleblower complaint made public this week described a meeting in March, shortly before the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act to speed deportations, where Bove ""stressed to all in attendance that the planes need to take off no matter what,"" then said that the group may need to consider telling judges ""f*** you"" and ignore possible court orders blocking immigrants from being removed from the U.S.
That account conflicts with several representations others inside the Justice Department have made to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg about when planes carrying migrants took off and passed through U.S. airspace on their way to El Salvador.
For his part, Bove told senators he could not recall using an expletive and he ""never"" advised DOJ lawyers to violate court orders. But he said he might have used words in that meeting that ""conveyed the importance of the upcoming operation"" to deport migrants.

Blanche and his wife are close with Bove. They both showed up at the confirmation hearing Wednesday, in a show of support. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was giving separate testimony before the appropriations committee, also made an appearance at the Bove hearing.
In Washington, Bove has played a central role in efforts to shrink the Justice Department and shift its priorities.
He reported for duty on Inauguration Day and soon made several controversial moves early in the new administration, from firing career prosecutors, to ordering up a list of FBI agents and intelligence analysts who helped build cases against people who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Eric Adams case fallout
And Bove personally stood up in court, solo, this year in New York to move to drop the corruption case against New York's mayor, an unusual move for such a high-ranking Justice Department official.
Bove's push to get prosecutors to dismiss the indictment against Eric Adams, but leave open the possibility that Adams could be prosecuted in the future, provoked outcry and prompted about a dozen prosecutors to resign rather than carry out what they considered to be a possibly corrupt deal.

""[A]ny assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way,"" wrote Hagan Scotten, one of the Adams prosecutors who quit.
""If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.""
At the confirmation hearing, Bove flatly denied any improper quid pro quo. But he refused to answer whether he consulted with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller or other political advisers before moving to drop the Adams case.
U.S. District Judge Dale Ho
ultimately dismissed
the case against Adams but not without casting aspersions on the Justice Department.
""Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,"" the judge wrote.

""I think he is more likely than not applying his own views on how the executive branch and how the Department of Justice should work, informed by his own experience within it,"" Fragoso said.

Bove embraced this interpretation Wednesday, brushing off the new whistleblower complaint this way: ""This is fundamentally a dispute about challenges posed by the unelected bureaucracy to the unitary executive.""
But Stacey Young, a former DOJ lawyer who now runs a group called Justice Connection, criticized his nomination.

Satellites show damage to Iran's nuclear program, but experts say it's not destroyed
Yesterday, the White House disputed that claim.

Well ... not necessarily.
Decades ago, I covered another effort to create a powerful Earth-penetrating weapon. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, with an eye toward the caves of Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding, then-President George W. Bush's administration looked at whether a nuclear weapon could be dropped from a plane into the ground. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, as the concept was known, would deliver a powerful shock to underground tunnels and bunkers.
Science
If a U.S. 'bunker buster' hits a nuclear site, what might get released into the air?
But when scientists got involved, they found there was no way to get a nuclear weapon nearly deep enough to contain the blast and radioactive fallout, and the program was eventually abandoned.
I went back to take a look at the math from those early studies, and I found it actually was fairly straightforward. The so-called
penetration equations
have existed since the 1960s and depend on a limited number of factors, including the shape of the nose cone, the weight and diameter of the weapon, the speed at which it hits the ground, and — crucially — the type of earth it gets dropped on.
Sponsor Message
""It depends enormously on the kind of rock,"" says Raymond Jeanloz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the original authors of
the 2005 National Academies Study
on earth penetrators.
When I ran the calculations, using a key equation from that study, I found out that the GBU-57 could go up to 80 meters (262 feet) underground if it was dropped in silty clay.
In medium-strength rock, things looked far different. The GBU-57 could only go around 7.9 meters (about 25 feet) beneath the earth — far short of the 60 meters claimed by the infographics.
AND MATH!
Plug it all in, with the coefficient for ""Medium-strength rock"" and you get a penetration depth of 7.9 m (25 ft).
That is WELL short of the 60 m claimed and the 80-90m depth of Fordow.

This may be an important part of the reason the weapon failed to destroy its target — if indeed the bombs did fail as the DIA assessment claims.
The administration continues to dispute the reporting that the bombs failed to hit Fordo, although it has shifted its stance. ""The intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says, 'We don't know, it could have been very severe' —  that's what the intelligence says,"" President Trump told reporters travelling with him today in the Hague.
Jeanloz says that it's not just the strength of the rock. Changes in the geologic structure can also cause the bomb to change direction even as it moves through the Earth.
""If there's any variations ... including fractures or gaps, that can deflect the trajectory into the ground,"" he says. Those same variations can disperse any blast from the bomb.
It's clear that American planners were aware of these kinds of challenges. Rather than dispatching one or two GBU-57s, they sent 12 to drop on Fordo. Based on satellite imagery, it looks like they may have been dropped in pairs, with the first weapon fracturing the rock to increase the penetrating depth of the second. The bombers also appeared to target Fordo's ventilation system, a possible weak point.
Loading...
The weapons likely created a powerful shockwave in the rock that would have traveled deep underground, rattling the facility below.
But Jeanloz says those shockwaves weaken quickly as they move into the rock. Fordo's position directly under the ridge of the mountain probably maximized that protection.
In fact, going deeper is a simple solution to the threat of bunker-busters. A major conclusion from the 2005 study was that ""it's cheaper and easier for someone to dig deeper than it is to penetrate through that depth,"" he says.
Geology, it turns out, may have foiled one of the most audacious American air operations in recent memory.

An early, classified intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates
U.S. strikes did not ""obliterate"" Iran's nuclear enrichment program

Israel's goal is to stop Iran's nuclear program from further advancement, and prevent it from the ability to make a nuclear weapon, which is a long-shared goal with the United States.
Democrats were upset after the White House postponed a Tuesday night briefing about the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program. A briefing is now scheduled to take place Wednesday evening for the Senate and on Friday for members of the House.
Quigley spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about the postponed briefings and the state of Iran's nuclear infrastructure.
The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin
: Do you have any initial questions or comments?
Rep. Mike Quigley
: I think they have to own up to the fact that the truth matters. Just the fact that the president's ego may be dinged by the fact that his initial statements weren't correct, it really doesn't matter. You've got to put your ego in your pocket. You have to face the threats as they exist, not as the president's ego maintains.
Sponsor Message
Martin
: Do you have any visible visibility yourself into the extent of the damage done to Iran's nuclear capabilities?
Quigley
: These strikes are very difficult to evaluate, especially in a denied area. It takes time. These are difficult, hard targets. They are mobile targets. To say they were ""obliterated"" before any analysis is fanciful and frankly dangerous. And the [International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' watchdog group] also [...] said there's probably 30 sites. So, what I tried to do was just to make this bipartisan and honest.
Chairman [Michael McCaul, R-Texas] said, 'I've been briefed on this plan in the past and it was never meant to completely destroy the facilities, but rather cause significant damage. It was always known to be a temporary setback.' Well, I'll add to that. I've been briefed on this many, many times, this kind of plan — on an unclassified basis as well. It was also clear that you were never going to end this program unless you have troops on the ground, and that means a war. So by abandoning diplomacy and the fact that Iran was in compliance before, the president has in fact made the situation more dangerous.
Martin
: Why do you think there's such a discrepancy between the administration's version of events and those of the intelligence community? And was that the administration's objective to obliterate the nuclear program? It sounds to me like you're saying, from what you understand, that that just would never have been the case.
Quigley
: You cannot obliterate the program with simple missile strikes. And that's what we have acknowledged all along. So what we're facing here is a president — and why we're in this situation — he refuses to ever admit that he's wrong. He wants to be able to say, 'This is all over and let's move on.' It's not that neat.

Martin
: So what would you like to see? What does the U.S. need to do now, in your opinion?
Quigley
: Iran is in a weakened state, as are their proxies. Now's the time to push again for diplomacy. It's the only thing that's ever worked. It's the only thing that will work.

The assessment comes less than a day after a ceasefire declared by Trump between Israel and Iran went into effect, with both sides agreeing to end the fighting. Israel has said repeatedly that its goal in the war had been to stop Iran's nuclear program, and prevent it from the ability to make a nuclear weapon — a goal long-shared by the United States.

The U.S. used
massive bunker-buster bombs

at the White House after those strikes
, Trump called the strikes a ""spectacular military success"" and said Iran's enrichment facilities had been ""completely and totally obliterated,"" he said.
But the U.S. official NPR spoke to said that the intelligence assessment concluded there had been ""limited"" damage to the critical infrastructure at the Fordo facility in particular.

Hegseth said the FBI was investigating how the report, which he said was top secret, was leaked to reporters.

""At the end of the day there are some really important things that haven't been hit,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who tracks Iran's nuclear facilities. ""If this ends here, it's a really incomplete strike.""
Experts have long warned that Iran's nuclear ability doesn't just lie in its facilities, but also in its deep knowledge — something much more difficult to attack.
""The simple fact is that Israel was never going to be able to eliminate Iran's capacity to build nuclear weapons entirely if Iranians choose to do so,"" says Kenneth Pollack, vice president for policy at the Middle East Institute. ""The knowledge is just too widespread within the Iranian system.""
Iranian officials have said they will proceed
In a statement on X
in Farsi, Iran's speaker of parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, said that Iran would ""completely disregard"" Israel's demands to stop enriching uranium, a key component to a nuclear weapon. He said Iran will continue to proceed in their own self interests.
The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, Hamad Eslami,
told a semi-official Iranian news agency
that they were still assessing the damage from Saturday night's attacks, but had prepared in advance. ""Our plan is to not allow any interruption in the production and service process,"" he said.
Trump said he believes that Iran did not have enough time to remove enriched nuclear material from Fordo before the strikes, saying it was ""very hard and very dangerous"" to remove the material. ""We believe it's all down there,"" Trump said.

Despite resistance, Florida officials are turning an airfield in the Everglades into a migrant detention center, which they've nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" due to its proximity to the apex predators.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed the project last week, saying
in a video
posted to X that, in support of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had asked state leaders to identify places for temporary detention facilities.

It presents an efficient, low-cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because you don't need to invest that much in the perimeter,"" he said. ""If people get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons.""
The site of the proposed facility is the
Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport
, located along the eastern boundary of the
Big Cypress National Preserve
and some 55 miles west of Miami. The state originally intended for it to become the ""Everglades Jetport"" — envisioned as the largest airport in the world — but
halted development in the 1970s
over environmental concerns.
These days, its sole 10,500-foot long runway is primarily used as a precision-instrument landing and training facility, according to Miami International Airport. Uthmeier described the site as ""virtually abandoned.""
He got the green light within days.
Uthmeier told the right-wing podcast

on Monday
that the federal government had approved his plan that morning, with the facility on track to open the first week of July. He said it would have 5,000 beds — half of its total capacity — by ""early July.""

Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has
acknowledged DeSantis' authority
but asserted that county officials ""continue to have significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state's effort, particularly regarding the environmental safeguards in place given the potentially devastating impact to the Everglades.""
And on Friday, two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity —
filed suit
against federal and state officials, saying the plan hasn't undergone an environmental review as required under federal law, and the public has not had an opportunity to comment. The suit is calling for work on the site to be halted until the defendants comply with relevant laws and regulations.
Jeremy Redfern, a spokesperson for the Florida Attorney General's office, told NPR over email that they had anticipated ""frivolous claims and banter from those who oppose enforcing immigration law.""
""Our expectation proved correct, and we look forward to defending Florida's efforts to support Secretary Noem and the Trump Administration with immigration enforcement,"" he added.
DeSantis has defended the plan and downplayed environmental concerns,
telling reporters
this week that the facility will be temporary and there will be ""zero environmental impacts.""
When asked about the concerns of environmental and immigration advocates, and what a potential review process might look like, the DHS referred NPR

""You solve it with lawful processing (like humanitarian parole, [Temporary Protected Status], humane infrastructure, and actual policy — not by staging a $450 million stunt in the middle of hurricane season.""
Who's paying for the project?

that the project will be funded ""in large part"" by FEMA's Shelter and Services Program.
The program was created in late 2022 to help cover some of the costs for communities sheltering migrants who have been released by DHS and are awaiting court hearings. It provided reimbursements to state and local governments, as well as nonprofits, in 35 communities throughout fiscal years 2023 and 2024, according to the

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that President Trump's tariffs pave a ""highly uncertain"" path for the U.S. economy, which warrants the central bank's wait-and-see approach to cutting interest rates.
""We do expect to show up — tariff inflation to show up more,"" Powell told

Inflation is holding steady as Trump's tariffs have yet to fully hit
The Fed last week
left interest rates unchanged
, though policymakers signaled they remain on track for two rate cuts later this year. That decision came despite President Trump's continued campaign — and personal attacks on Powell — to press the independent central bank for faster interest rate cuts to boost the economy.
The Fed last week pointed to low employment, growing wages and ""decent"" economic growth as reasons to maintain — rather than ease — the cost of borrowing. And in his semi-annual report to Congress Tuesday, Powell reaffirmed this stance as he was asked why the Fed has not followed the faster pace of rate-cuts done by European central banks.
""The reason we're not is the forecast,"" the Fed chair said, ""all professional forecasters that I know of, on the outside and the Fed, do expect a meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.""
Many businesses might still be working through inventories that got shipped before the tariffs went into effect, Powell also said, adding that summer data should begin to show whether — or how much — consumer prices rise to cover new costs for U.S. importers.
President Trump has changed the level of his global tariffs several times in recent months, pausing many of them until next month as his administration continues to negotiate individual deals with countries. The Fed has been in a holding pattern on interest rates since December, after cutting borrowing costs by a full percentage point last year.

Within the Fed, there is some openness to lowering interest rates more quickly. After last week's meeting, a couple of governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — said they were open to considering rate cuts as early as their next meeting in July.
The central bank is tasked with both maintaining stable prices and maximum employment.
Besides tariffs, the Fed is monitoring the combined effects of Trump's policies on taxes, immigration and regulation. Tax cuts and deregulatory moves have the potential to boost the economy while strict border controls and
large-scale deportations
could make it harder for businesses to find the workers they need."

""We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing,"" Trump said to reporters as he left the White House.
More than any other president, Trump has been known to use coarse language in speeches and other public appearances. But even for him, this on-camera utterance of the f-word was new. American presidents have typically refrained from using it publicly, even when angry or frustrated.
""Politics is sometimes a dirty and ugly business, and so people use language there that might be better preserved in the locker room — but in no instance do I recall a president openly using this term in a public forum,"" said Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.

Riley has heard that word come out of the mouths of former White House staff plenty over the years in his role as co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the Miller Center. Staff often curse, and he said a number of presidents have been known to use expletives behind closed doors.
There have even been a handful of instances of cursing caught on a hot mic, when an official didn't know they were being recorded. But this — an f-bomb used deliberately, on camera — was new.

""The question is whether you brazen it out or you apologize,"" Riley said. ""And I'm sure in this case, the president will just brazen it out."""

A longtime government lawyer told Congress that Justice Department leaders planned to knowingly defy court orders and withhold information from judges to advance the Trump administration's
aggressive deportation goals
, according to a newly published whistleblower complaint.
The lawyer, Erez Reuveni, previously won awards and commendations over nearly 15 years at the Justice Department, including from Republican appointees in the first Trump administration. But he was put on leave and then fired in April after he told a federal judge an immigrant had been
deported in error

Trump loves saying 'You're fired.' Now he's making it easier to fire federal workers
Reuveni ultimately decided to blow the whistle to lawmakers and watchdogs at the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel, detailing what he called defiance and noncompliance in three separate immigration cases this year. His accusations add to broader concern about the Trump administration's repeated clashes with the judiciary over immigration and other policies.
""Discouraging clients from engaging in illegal conduct is an important part of the role of a lawyer,"" his attorneys wrote in the complaint. ""Mr. Reuveni tried to do so and was thwarted, threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged for both doing his job and telling the truth to the court.""
News of the complaint, first reported by The New York Times, comes a day before senior Justice Department official Emil Bove is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Bove is President Trump's nominee to serve as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a post that carries a lifetime appointment.

Bove also is a former personal lawyer to Trump. He worked alongside now Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to defend Trump in four separate criminal cases. Blanche issued a statement calling Reuveni's claims ""utterly false.""
In the new filing, Reuveni disclosed a meeting inside the Justice Department on March 14, shortly before Trump formally declared he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members and fly them to El Salvador.
At that meeting, the whistleblower complaint said, Bove ""stressed to all in attendance that the planes need to take off no matter what."" Bove then said that the group may need to consider telling judges ""f*** you"" and ignore possible court orders blocking immigrants from being removed from the U.S., according to the document.

Judge: 'Probable cause' to hold U.S. in contempt over Alien Enemies Act deportations
That account calls into question several representations others inside the Justice Department have made to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg about when planes carrying migrants took off and passed through U.S. airspace before they landed in El Salvador.
The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said, ""I was at the meeting described in the article and at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.""
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., thanked Reuveni for speaking up. Durbin, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the new allegations add to a ""troubling"" list of actions by Bove, who also pushed to fire prosecutors who worked on Capitol riot cases and to back away from the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
Law
Trump official targeting Jan. 6 investigators worked on those cases himself
""These serious allegations, from a career Justice Department lawyer who defended the first Trump Administration's immigration policies, not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law,"" Durbin said.
Durbin added that confirming Bove to a lifetime-tenured judicial seat could have ""dire consequences.""
Reuveni's complaint could reverberate far beyond Capitol Hill, since courts across the nation continue to consider the legality of Trump's speedy deportations.

U.S. Supreme Court allows — for now — third-country deportations
Reuveni's attorneys, Dana Gold and Andrea Meza at the Government Accountability Project and Kevin Owen at Gilbert Employment Law, said the Justice Department actions ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons — citizen and noncitizen alike — who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska, has a reputation for bucking her party.
She sometimes broke away from President Trump on key issues during his first term like the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She detailed some of those moments in her new book, ""Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.""
""I am one who when I see something that needs to be called out, I will call it out if it needs to be,"" she told NPR.

Murkowski sat down with
All Things Considered
host Juana Summers to discuss her memoir, her thoughts on
Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill
and the future of democracy.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Juana Summers:
What do you think that the American people should understand about what is currently in [the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and why you're not on board at this point?
Lisa Murkowski:
I don't refer to it as the big beautiful bill. It is big and I'm not quite sure it's beautiful yet.
And there is much in it, quite honestly, that I really like. There are many aspects contained in the bill that I think are going to be important from a border perspective, from a defense perspective and from an energy perspective.
But having said that, where's the bulk of the attention right now? It's on Medicaid, the impact to Medicaid. We in Alaska, are a very high cost state when it comes to health care and, quite frankly, very limited access to care for many.
Policy-ish
Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
So, Medicaid is very important to so many in our state. I want to make sure that as
we are looking to address some of the concerns that we know exist in Medicaid.
We can always do more when it comes to oversight and areas of reform. But I want to make sure that it works for those who are in greatest need.
Summers:
And I'll ask you about just one other piece of legislation, which is the rescission package, which would take back $9.4 billion that were already appropriated for foreign aid, as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Sponsor Message
I'll just note that about $1 billion of that funding goes to CPB, which sends much of it to local stations that carry PBS and NPR programming. I know that you're on the Senate Appropriations Committee that's going to hold a hearing on this package this week.
Murkowski:
I am an unabashed supporter of public broadcasting in my state that is so highly rural.
It is the benefits of public broadcasting that allows people to not only get their news, but to communicate with one another, to be given alerts as to storms and what is happening with tides and landslides and the fishing report.
So for me, I am looking at this and saying the threat to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is very real with this rescission. And it's not something that I support. And likewise, within some of the global health programs, we have seen the benefit. One of the ways that we are able to help in many ways avoid conflict is through humanitarian efforts that our nation is engaged in. And so the role that we will play is important.
Politics
House votes to kill funding for public media
As an appropriator, I look at these accounts. These were all authorized and appropriated by Congress. Now you have an administration coming in and saying, ""We don't like this. Get rid of it.""
We have a role as the appropriators. We can listen to their advice ... but Congress has a role here. And I think we need to make sure that everybody remembers that ultimately it is the Congress that has the power of the purse, has the power to determine those appropriations.
Summers:
You never voted for Trump, yet you're a member of a political party that has been largely defined by the president, his MAGA movement. I wonder, do you feel like there is still a place for moderates within the Republican Party, for people like you?
Sponsor Message
Murkowski:
I think there is still a place in the Congress for moderates. We need more on the Republican side. We need more on the Democrat side. I think we need people who are willing to try to come together to solve problems, not on a partisan basis, but on the basis of, ""Is this going to be good for a rural state like Alaska and an urban state like Massachusetts?""
Summers:
A broad question for you. Do you think that the country's democracy is on unstable footing?
Murkowski:
I mentioned I've been in the Senate now for two decades, a long time. There have been hard issues that have come before us. There have been matters of conflict that may turn to war. There has been an internal divide. I have never been part of more conversations where people have asked whether or not democracy is safe right now.
I think part of it is because we see within our own institutions greater politicization, greater politicization in the courts.
But when people stop believing in the integrity of their institutions. That's when I think there is fear about the fundamentals of our democracy.
It is not something that I would say, ""It's all over."" Absolutely, positively not.

Summers:
What is your message to people who right now feel like they don't have a political home?
Murkowski:
Don't assume that anybody else is going to speak up for you. Don't be ground down because you don't think that you're being heard.
It's when you stop speaking up that those of us who are in a position to listen start to think, ""Well, maybe your silence means you think everything is OK.""
And if you don't think it's OK. It is your obligation to speak up. I've never been to a protest as a protester.

What we saw the weekend before last with marches around the country where people were speaking up in some of the smallest villages in Alaska. We had people that were speaking out and maybe they were just speaking out to their neighbors. But I think that that's some of the best part of who we are. We're in a country where you feel like you can speak out, do it peaceably, do it without violence.
I need to send a voice of — I hope — positivity. And I think this is where I hoped people would be after reading my book, that there is a glimmer of hope. There should be a desire to be involved in your community, in your state, in helping others be better people.
You should want to do this. In fact, there's an obligation for you to do it at some different level. And you may think it requires a specific resume or a specific background. It doesn't. It just requires a heart to try to make a difference. You do that and we're going to be OK."

The Trump administration's push to rapidly amass sensitive personal information about hundreds of millions of people living in the U.S. is extending to a rich new vein of information: troves of databases run by states. In some instances, the data could be leveraged to enhance the
federal government's immigration enforcement efforts
— a break with longstanding norms and practices that also raises legal questions.
""Every week we're seeing new examples of this administration demanding or sharing sensitive government data for unprecedented uses,"" said Nicole Schneidman, who heads the technology and data governance team at Protect Democracy, a nonprofit legal center that describes its mission as ""defeating the authoritarian threat.""

Schneidman said Americans should understand ""the data that they have entrusted to state governments right now is truly a target.""

USDA, DOGE demand states hand over personal data about food stamp recipients
For instance, the Department of Agriculture told states last month
they will need to turn over
the names, Social Security numbers, addresses and dates of birth of the tens of millions of people who applied for federal food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the last five years — or potentially risk losing federal funds.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued subpoenas to states and localities for records that include the personal information of noncitizens,
including for sensitive details on applicants to a California program
that gives monthly support to low income, elderly or disabled legal immigrants who do not qualify for Social Security payments.
And earlier this month, federal health officials
shared data about millions of Medicaid recipients
from a handful of states with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement.
Aiding in Trump's effort to consolidate data is an
executive order
the president signed in March, ""Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,"" which calls for the federal government to have ""unfettered access"" to data from state programs that receive federal funds, including data sets held by third parties.
Sponsor Message
The order says data sharing can help eliminate ""bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency while enhancing the Government's ability to detect overpayments and fraud.""
While data sharing across government entities can create efficiencies, it also risks running afoul of federal laws, which are supposed to guard against the federal government having unconstrained access to personal data.
Politics
DOGE says it needs to know the government's most sensitive data, but can't say why
Under the Privacy Act of 1974, federal agencies are supposed to tell the public how they intend to use and safeguard personal data before they begin collecting it, and are not supposed to use data beyond that purpose.
Privacy experts warn of dramatic implications if federal agencies are able to seize the sensitive data currently held only by states and use it broadly without constraint. One fear is that the data could be used by the federal government to create powerful surveillance tools that could be used on all Americans.
""Once this kind of data is in the wrong hands and in particular is aggregated, it can be used for an incredibly broad ranging set of purposes,"" Schneidman of Protect Democracy said. ""It is critical for every American to understand there is no 'undo' button here.""
In other countries data has been used to ""quash dissent at scale,"" Schneidman said.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the Trump administration's data efforts and dismissed critics as biased.
""President Trump is streamlining data collection across all agencies to increase government efficiency and save hard-earned taxpayer dollars,"" Rogers wrote in an email. ""The Trump Administration is committed to protecting the privacy of Americans.""
Leveraging data to track immigrants
For months, the Trump administration has been
consolidating data
across the federal government with the stated goal of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, including searching for cases of ineligible noncitizens fraudulently receiving public benefits. At the same time, the effort could also
help the administration track noncitizens
and scale up deportations.

This month's Medicaid data transfer appears to be among the largest known cases yet of sensitive data from states being shared across federal agencies.
Top officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ordered staff at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to share with DHS sensitive data from a handful of states about millions of their Medicaid enrollees, according to reporting by
The Associated Press
.
Sponsor Message
The data pertains to Medicaid recipients in California, Illinois, Washington and Washington, D.C., according to the AP report. Those jurisdictions allow some noncitizens who do not qualify for federal Medicaid to enroll in a version of the program that is funded by the state. (All states receive federal funding to use for emergency care, which can treat low-income patients regardless of their immigration status.)
A number of state officials have
voiced outrage
that the state data was shared with DHS.
""CMS has long promised the public that it is committed to protecting the integrity and privacy of its data, including not sharing it for immigration enforcement purposes,"" Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services spokesperson Melissa Kula wrote in an email, adding that the state agency is ""deeply concerned.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom
called the move ""legally dubious""
and in a
letter
sent last week, the state's U.S. senators alleged it may have violated the federal Privacy Act of 1974, the Social Security Act and the health privacy law known as HIPAA. The senators called on DHS to destroy the Medicaid data it received.
Public information officers from California, Illinois and Washington told NPR they still have not been notified by CMS about the data transfer and therefore could not confirm what data DHS holds. States routinely must share detailed data about Medicaid enrollees with CMS, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and immigration status, under the expectation that it will remain confidential and secure.
Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon called the transfer ""lawful interagency data sharing with DHS"" and said it was part of an effort by CMS Director Mehmet Oz to crack down
on states ""that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants.""
Oz
announced that priority
in late May, citing a presidential
executive action
that calls for federal agencies to ensure federal public benefits are not being accessed by immigrants in the country illegally.
Sponsor Message
Nixon denied the data transfer to DHS was ""unprecedented"" in his statement, but declined to respond to an NPR request to explain what the precedent was, or clarify what Medicaid data was shared.
In a statement to NPR, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, ""CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans"" but did not respond to questions about the specifics of what data was received.
Sharing sensitive Medicaid data that was collected by CMS to administer the program with another federal agency would be ""a totally unauthorized repurposing of this data,"" said Jeffrey Grant, a former CMS official who left earlier this year after working there for 30 years. ""You cannot just hand data over.""
Privacy and democracy advocates who have been warning about the potential for federal data grabs at the state level in recent months saw the Medicaid data transfer to DHS last week as a turning point.
""This is exactly why privacy advocates have been sounding the alarm about this administration's unprecedentedly boundless approach to collecting people's data,"" said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology.
""Not only will this discourage states from cooperating with the federal government going forward, it will lead people to miss out on life-saving benefits they're entitled to as they can't trust that their information won't be used against them,"" Laird said.
Politics
Senate Republicans' changes to 'big beautiful bill' tee up clash with House
The disclosure of Medicaid data to immigration authorities comes as Congress is weighing
massive cuts to that program
and other parts of the federal social safety net.
""If your goal is a policy program that supports the most vulnerable people in society, this approach makes no sense whatsoever,"" Ami Fields-Meyer, a senior fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University specializing in the intersection between civil liberties and technology, and a former senior policy adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris, recently told NPR.

""But if you're trying to integrate critical assistance into a machinery for hunting immigrants and breaking up families and deporting people without due process — this is exactly how you do it.""
New models for demanding state data
The revelations about Medicaid data follow new data-sharing guidance that the USDA issued to states last month to turn over personal information about tens of millions of SNAP recipients. Several states have announced their intent to comply with the USDA's unprecedented demand, but the plan is also getting pushback.
Politics
USDA says demand for sensitive food stamp data from states is on hold
After a
federal lawsuit
accused USDA's data demand of violating federal privacy laws, a senior official said in court filings that data would not be collected until the department satisfied legal requirements and could ensure the data would be appropriately safeguarded.
Recently, the USDA
published a public notice, as is required by the Privacy Act,
of its intent to collect the data. The notice says the department will check SNAP applicants against federal databases to verify eligibility, including checking immigration status and finding duplicate enrollments. The wording of the notice suggests the collected data can be used much more broadly than past department data sets.
Separately, the USDA's Office of Inspector General is continuing to press certain states for personal data on SNAP participants for the stated goal of evaluating the quality and integrity of the data, according to emails reviewed by NPR. In at least one state, the data request includes citizenship status and information about household members, but not other information that's used to determine eligibility, such as employment status or income, the emails show.
Critics of this administration's data sharing efforts have pointed out that
Project 2025
, the sprawling proposed template drafted by conservative activists for Trump's second term, suggested gaining access to new sources of state data for purposes that include immigration enforcement.
Sponsor Message
The document says the federal government should make certain federal grants to states and localities contingent on ""total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement,"" including ""access to department of motor vehicles and voter registration databases.""
Those objectives echo data requests the first Trump administration made to states, when there was a push for states to
share DMV
and voter information, but
most states refused
.

Trump's DOJ focuses in on voter fraud, with a murky assist from DOGE
Elections
Trump's DOJ makes its most sweeping demand for election data yet
Now in Trump's second term, federal agencies including
DOGE and DHS have begun analyzing state voter rolls
to look for noncitizens, as directed by Trump's
executive order
on elections. Separately, the Department of Justice sent an
unprecedented request to Colorado
for all its election records last month.
Legal and privacy issues raise dilemmas for states
Data sharing across federal agencies and with states can be an invaluable tool, said Allan Medina, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Goodwin, a law firm, but he cautioned it has to be done appropriately.
As a federal prosecutor, Medina worked in a strike force alongside HHS' Office of Inspector General, FBI and other state and federal law enforcement partners to investigate medical device companies defrauding Medicaid. But he said in that context, everyone involved had been trained about how to safeguard sensitive tax and health data and understood the limits of how they were legally allowed to be used.
He said Trump's executive order on eliminating data silos raises questions on who exactly is receiving the sensitive data. ""It could be whomever, [it] could be people within DOGE,"" Medina said. ""Are they trained? What are the training protocols?""
Law
Supreme Court grants DOGE access to confidential Social Security records
While there have been more than a dozen lawsuits challenging DOGE's data access on privacy grounds, court rulings have been mixed. After a
federal judge in Maryland temporarily stopped DOGE
from accessing sensitive information at the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Supreme Court
stayed that ruling
, allowing DOGE unfettered access.
The unprecedented data requests from the federal government are causing states to carefully consider their responses, especially if they risk violating state privacy laws by inappropriately turning over records.

Colorado is evaluating how to respond to a detailed data request for its Medicaid data,
according to

Separately, Colorado's labor director has argued an ICE subpoena asking for personal information of sponsors of child migrants is illegal under state law, and

, for instructing him to respond to it.
City officials in Chicago have told news outlets they
have not responded to an ICE subpoena
for records from a city ID program used in large part by immigrants, including those without legal status.
Such ICE subpoenas to states, cities and counties to get records for groups or programs appears to be a new tactic, said Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law who has done
extensive research
into ICE's use of subpoenas.
""There's reasons that these subpoenas very well may be invalid,"" Nash said. She says states should carefully consider how to respond and should prioritize protecting information.
Some states are trying to be proactive.
Before Illinois' Medicaid data reportedly wound up in the hands of DHS, Gov. JB Pritzker — a Democrat and prominent critic of the administration — issued
an executive order
to protect the data privacy of individuals with autism after federal health officials
announced
plans to use Medicaid and Medicare data for a
new database for autism research
.
Maryland's Department of Human Services sent a letter to its vendors, grantees, contractors and community partners saying personally identifiable information and protected health information ""should be kept confidential and not shared, disclosed or accessed, except in accordance with the contract and applicable law.""
Laird, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said an important factor in how this shakes out is how states choose to react to data requests.
During Trump's first term, officials from red and blue states
pushed back
on the idea of sharing sensitive data on voters, including birth dates and partial Social Security numbers, with a federal commission on election integrity.

Still, Laird said she wonders if that spirit of resistance to federal data requests will persist.

Middle East conflict
After lashing out at Israel and Iran, Trump says the 'ceasefire is in effect'
Despite years of promises by President Trump to keep the country from entangling itself in another Middle East conflict, the U.S.
entered the Israel-Iran conflict
on Saturday and bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Then Trump announced on Monday that Israel and Iran had reached a
ceasefire deal
, which came hours after Iran fired missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar.
Moments after Trump's social media announcement, Vice President JD Vance said Trump wants to work on a ""long-term settlement"" between Iran and Israel.
""I think the Iranians are at a place where they don't want to keep on fighting,"" Vance said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier.
""What the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks, through their now-failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very good at war. And I think the president really hit the reset button and said, 'Look, let's actually produce long-term peace for the region,'"" Vance continued.

On Tuesday, Trump lashed out at Israel and Iran and

Interview highlights
Michel Martin
: So the ceasefire seems to have fallen apart at the moment. The president said this morning that both Israel and Iran violated it. Do you have any sense of what's next?
Rep. Jim Himes
: Well, I'm not sure anybody has a sense of what's next. It does seem like in these first couple of days of conflict, we have avoided the 20 or 30 worst case scenarios that usually accompany a war in the Middle East. We're not seeing gas prices spike. We're not seeing fatalities or casualties of American troops. But of course, this is a day-to-day thing. At some point, we've got to ask the question of, given the immense gamble that was taken here both by Israel and by the president of the United States, I would point out without consultation of the United States Congress, as required by law, what was actually achieved. I have seen absolutely no evidence to back up the vice president's statement that the Iranian nuclear program was obliterated. In fact, I would be very, very surprised if that was, in fact, true. So the question obviously remains, if the Iranian nuclear program was set back in a very small way, all of this risk and this massive gamble will have been undertaken for a tiny marginal improvement at best.
Martin
: So who in the U.S. government is trying to get to the bottom of what was actually accomplished in those strikes? And do you have any confidence that whoever is sort of tasked with this will report to you and other members of Congress?
Himes
: Well, the answer to your question is that the, you know, extensive apparatus of the intelligence community, and as you might imagine, that involves everything from satellites to the ability to conduct espionage against the nation of Iran, traditional espionage, I do think that we will have a pretty good sense in the coming days and weeks of what was actually achieved in Iran.
Sponsor Message
Martin
: You've said that you learned about the U.S. strikes on Iran through social media. Is there a path toward getting more oversight moving forward?
Himes
: Well, in my many years of experience serving on the Intelligence Committee, I will tell you that this administration has been uniquely bad about responding to the constitutionally mandated jobs of oversight that we do. As you point out, my Republican counterpart, Rick Crawford, the chairman of the committee, was informed prior to the raid but I, the Democrat, was not. And so we're seeing sort of almost disdain from this administration with respect to that oversight.
Martin
: What recourse do you and other Democrats have? You make the argument that this isn't just a custom, that this is required. So then the question becomes, how do you enforce that going forward?
Himes
: There's not a good answer to that question because the Democratic Party, the party in which I am a member, is in the minority. And to date, the Republican majority, which has subpoena power, which has the ability to move bills to the floor, which has the ability to hold administration officials in contempt, has shown precisely zero interest in doing that. Now, the dissatisfying but honest answer to your question is that if the Democrats are able to take the majority and therefore, in 18 months, have subpoena power, have all of those tools at our disposal at that point, I think we'll have options other than simply making the case to the American people that shutting down the oversight and ignoring the rules is not okay.
Martin
: You co-introduced a War Powers Resolution that would remove U.S. armed forces from hostilities against Iran without approval from Congress. We had heard that there were some Republicans who were not pleased with the level of consultation with Congress. Do you have any sense that this might have enough support to go forward?
Sponsor Message
Himes
: We're certainly going to take a crack at it. And we're hoping against hope that maybe there are a handful of Republicans who will remember that their duty is to the Constitution, to which they raised their right hand and took an oath, as opposed to the man that occupies the Oval Office. That wouldn't be a terribly good bet if you were a betting person. But we are going to try to make that case because, again, it's always worth standing up for the prerogatives of the Congress and, frankly, for the Constitution and the law.

Why did you decide to get into elected office to begin with?
Moseley Braun:
I've been assistant United States attorney, and I had my son. And so I was with him. So I was here [in Illinois] with him, I was just being a homemaker which was fine. I really enjoyed it. But there were people in the neighborhood who were protesting the removal of the bobalinks from Jackson Park — and I joined them one day. The bobalinks are these little rice birds. Originally from South Carolina, but somehow they wound up here in Chicago. And so some of the people with whom I was marching said, ""We think you should run for state representative, our state representative is retiring."" So at first I demurred and wouldn't do it. But then after I got challenged, there was a there's a pundit here in Chicago who said, ''Don't run. You can't possibly win, the blacks won't vote for you because you're not part of the Chicago machine. The whites won't vote for you because you're black –and nobody's going to vote for you because you're only a woman."" And so that was my inspiration. That's what did it.

Moseley Braun:
Nobody thought I could win.
Martin:
But one of the things that was also interesting in the book, is that [there were] so many jobs that you had. There was a point at which nobody believed it was you [who] actually had that job. You tell the story about being an assistant U.S. attorney and coming home from one of those cold Chicago winters trying to get home and you're trying to hail a taxi. This is pre-Uber, of course. And this police officer keeps riding by you saying. What was he saying? Get off that corner?
Moseley Braun
: Give up that corner! Give up that corner!
Martin:
Give up that corner — he thought you were a hooker. Because why else would a black woman dressed up?
Moseley Braun
: Because I was a black woman standing on the corner in downtown Chicago.
Martin:
And then you talked about your first day at the Senate when you tried to get to your office. There was a Capitol Police officer who wouldn't let you in.
Moseley Braun
: Well there were always two Capitol Police standing on the doors to the Senate. The first guy said, ""you can't go in there."" I looked at him quizzically, like, ""Why? Why can't I?"" Then the other guy piped in and said, 'Oh, she's the new senator from Illinois."" And so that backed his colleague off.
Perspective
I hated history — until I learned about Shirley Chisholm
Martin:
I don't want people to think that the entire memoir is just filled with these insults directed at you. Although there were many like, for example, the senator who would sing Dixie in Your Presence and so forth — so there's that. But there were some structural issues that you also pointed out that made your job more difficult than for other people. For example, the amount of mail that you got. Could you talk about that?
Moseley Braun
: The mail was really a challenge because it was so much of it.They gave me a room in the basement of the Capitol that was filled with these duffel bags full of mail. There was no way I could possibly do all of that by myself. And so I went to leadership and I asked for some help. And one guy said to me, ""Well, Ted Kennedy gets a lot of mail and, you know, he handles it."" I'm thinking like you telling me I got a function like Ted Kennedy does — I was too out done.

Martin

Moseley Braun

Martin:
Why do you think you served only one term?
Moseley Braun
: Because of that. There was such expectations, and people expected me to come to every chicken fry in the state, and I couldn't do it. I did as much as I could, but I couldn't do it all.
Martin:
Do you think that's why at the end of the day, the expectations of you were just greater than you could as one person fulfill?
Moseley Braun
: That's part of it. But I think it's also what standard you [are] being held to. Again, I was kind of the duckbill platypus of the Senate in the sense that I was not only a woman, I am black, too. So you put those things together. And what you have is a set of expectations that border on the unreasonable, that border on the trailblazing and the groundbreaking, if you will. And so I did my very best to live up to those expectations. But it was not always possible.
Martin:
Is there anything you wish you'd done differently?
Moseley Braun:
Well, not really. I did the best job I could while I was planted. I really did. And I still am. I'm not dead yet. I spoke at a grammar school and the school was named after me. One little boy said, ""Hey, there goes Carol Moseley Braun,"" and his little friend turned around and said, ""You she's not dead yet."" So I'm still here.

Moseley Braun:
I hope the fact that I deflected all of the brickbats that I don't think anybody's going to be held to the same kind of standard I was being held to, in terms of production. I hope that has really provided a roadmap to people who come after us. Don't get distracted with all the noise around you — because there will be lots of noise around you. But if you don't let that distract you and just keep focusing on what the people elected you to do, you'll be fine.

The arrest of Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara in Georgia earlier this month highlights the risks journalists who are not citizens face under a Trump administration aggressively pursuing mass deportations.
Guevara is
currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody
after he live streamed his own arrest by local law enforcement for alleged unlawful assembly and obstruction of officers on June 14 while covering a ""No Kings"" protest in DeKalb County.
In a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said Guevara was not detained because he is a journalist. DHS said Guevara entered the country illegally in 2004 and urged him to ""self deport.""
Sponsor Message
His attorney, Giovanni Diaz, disputes that and told NPR that Guevara entered the U.S. legally on a tourist visa and has valid work authorization. Guevara also
has a pending application for adjustment of status
, which could result in him obtaining permanent residency.
Originally from El Salvador, Guevara has lived in the U.S. for about 20 years and built a large following covering immigrant communities in Georgia for Spanish-language media outlets and his independent outlet, MG News. On the day of his arrest, photos and video of the arrest clearly show Guevara wearing a vest with the words ""PRESS"" across the back and chest.
""I'm a member of the media, officer,"" Guevara can be heard saying
in his live stream
moments before his arrest as a row of law enforcement officers approach a sidewalk where he stood. As officers detain him, his phone falls to the ground and an officer picks it up at Guevara's request. The livestream partially shows Guevara being led away in handcuffs and then placed in a law enforcement vehicle.
Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told
Morning Edition
that Guevara's arrest sets an ""alarming precedent"" for noncitizen journalists working in the U.S.
Sponsor Message
In
a letter sent to DHS this week
, CPJ wrote that Guevara's case represents ""a grim erosion of both freedom of the press and the rule of law.""
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Leila Fadel:
So what is the Committee to Protect Journalists' concern here? Was he detained over his legal status or was he detained because of his work?
Katherine Jacobsen:
Guevara was initially detained because he was recording a protest. There are misdemeanor charges against him. It's highly irregular that any of those charges would actually be held up. We've seen this in many other cases. And simply put, Guevarra was doing his job and reporting the news. To use that as a pretext to hold him – a journalist – for a very long period of time in law enforcement detention, and then to transfer him to ICE detention after, that is something that we haven't seen before and is an incredibly alarming precedent to set.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
Fadel:
What protections exist for immigrant journalists like Guevara and others who are doing their jobs in the United States?
Jacobsen:
In theory, they enjoy the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen who is a reporter enjoy while they're out covering things. In the U.S., there are hundreds of foreign reporters. Many of them have a specific type of journalist visa, but some have other types of work authorization. And when a journalist who, again, is here legally is picked up by law enforcement and then his immigration status is called into question in the course of these legal proceedings, it's alarming.

Fadel:
So you sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security. What did you say in that letter? What were you asking for and what did they say back?
Jacobsen:
We sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking that Guevara be released immediately and pointed out that the whole reason why he was detained in the first place was because of charges relating to First Amendment activity. And we find that very problematic. We have not received a response. The Department of Homeland Security has also tweeted that the narrative about Guevara is false, though they have not specified further as to what the falsehoods are.

From the fringes to the mainstream: Meet the hard-line anti-immigration activist who helped shape Trump's agenda
Fadel:
What would you say to other non-citizen journalists in the United States right now who have work authorization or visas to do their jobs, who may be afraid to cover sensitive issues or protests because of what they're seeing?
Jacobsen:
I think there is a great deal of reason for concern at this time, and it's important to make sure that those journalists have contact with a good immigration lawyer, as well as First Amendment lawyers, and have a clear understanding of their rights.

We're offering a throwback to a conversation we had in 2020 with Jason Rezaian, Iranian American journalist who had been previously jailed in Iran. Back in January of 2020, the first Trump administration carried out a military operation killing Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian military commander. Now, the second Trump administration is striking Iranian nuclear sites. While lots has changed since 2020, much of our conversation with Jason is still eerily relevant.

The Supreme Court on Monday blocked a lower court order that required 15 days notice to individuals the Trump administration is trying to deport to countries other than their own.
The high court's action, at least for now, reversed the lower court's order requiring that those being deported have enough time to contact their lawyers and present evidence that would show their lives would be in danger if deported to certain countries.
The order focused on a flight carrying several men from various countries — including Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba and Mexico — which was initially headed to South Sudan but ended up in the East African country of Djibouti in order to give the men time to dispute their final destination. The U.S. government says the men are violent criminals, convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery, and said they don't deserve to stay in the U.S.
Sponsor Message
But Judge Brian Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts last month said people must still get a so-called ""credible fear"" interview in their native language to be able to dispute being sent to a country they're not originally from. He said people must get at least 15 days to challenge their deportations.

Deportees are being held in a converted shipping container in Djibouti, ICE says
Monday's unsigned Supreme Court order puts that decision on hold while the legal process continues in the lower courts.
In a searing dissent, the court's three liberals accused the conservative majority of ""rewarding lawlessness.""
Writing for the three, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, ""The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity be heard.""
Sotomayor said the Trump administration had already acted ""in violation of unambiguous"" lower court orders, by flying four noncitizens to Guantanamo Bay, and from there to El Salvador. Following that, she said, ""the government removed six people to South Sudan, with less than 16 hours notice"" basically overnight, and without any opportunity to contact their lawyers or be heard in court. The government, she said, ""thus openly flouted two court orders,"" even before it went to the Supreme Court.
Sponsor Message
""This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,"" she said.
Several migrants and U.S. detention officers awaited the court ruling while living in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in Djibouti, beset by high temperatures, exposure to malaria and close proximity to ""burn pits,"" which emit throat-clogging smog from burning trash and human waste.
Monday's Supreme Court order is the latest example of its willingness to allow President Trump's to accelerate deportations and
minimize due process
, based on the administration's assertion that it will be irreparably harmed by interventions from the lower courts while the cases are fully litigated through the appeals process — a process likely to take months.
Accusations of ""wreaking havoc""
U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on May 27 asked the Supreme Court for an immediate stay of Murphy's order, saying it is ""wreaking havoc on the third country removal process.""
""The United States is facing a crisis of illegal immigration, in no small part because many aliens most deserving of removal are often the hardest to remove,"" he
wrote
. Through ""sensitive diplomacy,"" the U.S. had convinced third countries to accept the men after their own countries refused, he said, but Murphy's order prevents that ""unless DHS first satisfies an onerous set of procedures invented by the district court"" to assess whether the men might be tortured or persecuted in the country to which they're sent.
Immigration
The White House is deporting people to countries they're not from. Why?
Immigration lawyers
told the Supreme Court
that even criminals deserve meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard before they're sent to a country with dangerous conditions where they could be tortured.
Lawyers from the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Human Rights First and the National Immigration Litigation Alliance say the men set to end up in South Sudan only got notification the night before their flight.
They also say Mexico, for example, had previously accepted its own citizens deported from the U.S., suggesting that the Trump administration's process of removing people to third countries is ""intentionally punitive."" South Sudan is a
politically unstable
country in Africa and one of the poorest in the world.

Prioritizing deportations
The strategy to rely on other countries to take in U.S. deportees is not new. But the Trump administration has prioritized getting more countries to repatriate their citizens, including from China, Venezuela and Cuba, in order to more quickly deport people from the U.S.
""And the further away the better, so they can't come back across the border,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio
said during an April cabinet meeting
.
Immigration
White House agrees to keep migrants in Djibouti for now, blasts federal judge's ruling
DHS policy requires any deportee to get notice of what country they're being sent to, ""and an opportunity for a prompt screening of any asserted fear of being tortured there.""
The arguments in court have centered on how long migrants should have to contest their removal to a country. DHS says this process takes ""minutes,"" not weeks. In the case of the flight to South Sudan, the men got less than 24 hours' notice. Immigration lawyers say such little time means deportees have little hope of arguing against a removal, especially if they don't speak English."

Iran's government is weighing how to respond after the U.S. military launched a series of coordinated bombing attacks Saturday against three Iranian nuclear facilities in a major escalation of the ongoing Middle East conflict.
The strikes were intended to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, according to U.S. officials. President Trump
said in a Truth Social post
Saturday evening that the American assault was ""very successful.""

Israel began bombing
nuclear facilities and other sites across Iran. The two countries have been trading deadly attacks since then, and the U.S. military has helped intercept missiles and drones fired at Israel. But the U.S. did not get directly involved in the Israeli offensive until the surprise strikes on Saturday.

Some bombers flew west as decoys, while the other planes that would ultimately strike Iranian nuclear sites flew east. Those B-2s dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs on multiple targets at the Fordo and Natanz sites between roughly 6:40 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. ET.

At around 5 p.m. ET Saturday, just as the bombers were entering Iranian airspace, a submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles at the Isfahan nuclear site.
The mission involved more than 125 aircraft and resulted in 75 precision guided weapons being dropped on the three locations, officials said. And they emphasized that this attack was against Iran's nuclear program, not against its military or people.
2. Iran warns the U.S. is responsible for the ""dangerous consequences""
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi
denounced the strikes
during a press conference in Istanbul on Sunday, calling them a violation of the law. ""The war-mongering and lawless administration in Washington is solely and fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching implications of its act of aggression,"" he said.

The International Atomic Energy Agency
confirmed on Sunday
that the three sites — Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz — were all hit in the attack. The extent of damage to the underground Fordo site was ""not immediately possible to assess,"" the agency said, adding that Natanz and Isfahan suffered additional damage in the U.S. bombings after previously being struck by Israeli forces.

All presidents deal with
extraordinary tests
.
Many are
not by their choosing
. But some are.
And President Trump's decision to
strike Iran's nuclear facilities
is one this president chose.
So how will the politics of that decision play out?
Here are five ways to think about that:
1. Trump ran on a pledge to end ""forever wars,"" so what comes next is pivotal.
As expected, Republicans are rallying around Trump after the strike, but some influential figures in the MAGA base are not thrilled with the prospect of involvement in another conflict in the Middle East.
Sponsor Message
Trump's action was unexpected, given that until very recently the president seemed keen on negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program. Trump does not want a prolonged war and certainly doesn't want to commit ground troops to the effort.
National Security
The U.S. used 'bunker buster' bombs in Iran. Here's what to know about them
Before the strike,
polls showed
Americans saw Iran as a fairly serious potential threat. But they were also largely against the U.S. joining Israel in its military campaign against Iran.
Now, the test for Trump is whether the conflict will be contained. The politics of a single operation is one thing. The politics of something more prolonged is another.
2. The full impact of the attack is not yet known. What will Americans learn and when?

Trump says the strikes ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear facilities. The administration will have to assess just how successful they were, likely with satellite photographs and human intelligence.
After the intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq War, the country is rightfully more skeptical of what the government says. Plus, with about half the country distrustful of Trump regardless, the public will likely expect incontrovertible
evidence
of a severe setback to Iran's nuclear capabilities.
Science
U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites show no sign of widespread environmental impact
On Sunday night,
Trump posted on Truth Social
that satellite images back his assertion of ""Monumental Damage.""
But independent experts
analyzing commercial satellite imagery
told NPR's Geoff Brumfiel that key components of Iran's nuclear enterprise may have survived the attack.
Middle East conflict
Satellites show damage to Iran's nuclear program, but experts say it's not destroyed
3. The results of Iran's retaliation will have consequences.
Israel has long planned for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, and Iran has been severely hampered in the last couple of years. With so many Iranian allies in the region depleted — from Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis to a Russia preoccupied with its war in Ukraine and a toppled Syrian regime — the time seemed ripe for the attack.
Now that it's happened, Iran will almost certainly look to respond. With its capabilities in question, Trump may have felt that the attack was worth the risk of potential retaliation.
Middle East conflict
World reacts to U.S. strikes on Iran with alarm, caution — and some praise
The Trump administration will work to repel those possible attempts, but from the military on down to governors and local police departments, the country is — and will be — on a heightened level of security concern.
A fatal attack on Americans anywhere in the world — from service members overseas to embassies or civilians — would have serious political ramifications in addition to the human cost.

4. The strike raises questions about Trump's approach to foreign affairs.
Beyond Trump's campaign pledges to take a less-interventionist approach than past Republican presidents, Trump has also pushed for peace deals overseas.
The biggest deals, though, have eluded him, whether it's trying to get a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, wanting to end the war between Russia and Ukraine and — until Saturday night — seeking a nuclear deal with Iran.
So why did Trump change his approach to Iran? Was it because he had privately determined that talks about a new nuclear deal were going nowhere (after having backed out of the one struck by the Obama administration during his first term) — or was it that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forced his hand?
Politics
Pentagon says Iranian nuclear capabilities are 'devastated' after U.S. strikes
When Netanyahu went forward with attacks on Iran, it put Trump in a corner. Politically, it's difficult for an American president to not appear publicly to be largely supportive of Israel. And Trump has never wanted to look weak.
While he said he wants to be the president of peace, projecting toughness and strength has also always been central to Trump's politics.
How his ""peace through strength"" approach plays out over the 3 1/2 years left in his presidency remains to be seen.

There are members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who would like to see presidents go to Congress for authorization of serious, nondefensive military action.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is pushing for clearer language that makes preauthorization from Congress a requirement — and he's done so during both Republican and Democratic presidencies. Bipartisan members of the House are doing the same.
That
debate
is going to continue, but with Republicans largely rallying around Trump, it's highly unlikely that requirement will pass through either chamber.

Trump administration defends Iranian strikes as some lawmakers question its legality
Democrats also run some risk in making the legality of the strikes a central issue (never mind calling for Trump's impeachment), because Republicans would paint them as defending Iran — regardless of the merits of their argument. If it becomes clear that the strikes did, in fact, significantly weaken Iran's nuclear capabilities, that would likely be to Trump's political advantage.
At the same time, Trump's unilateral action also builds on Democrats' message of Trump pushing the bounds of his authority in all aspects of the presidency."

Back in April, the veteran Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni was in court, representing the government in the case of
Kilmar Abrego Garcia
, the man the government mistakenly deported to El Salvador.
The judge peppered Reuveni with questions: How was Abrego Garcia seized? What authority did law enforcement officers have to take him from his car?
""So, Your Honor, my answer to a lot of these questions is going to be frustrating,"" Reuveni responded. ""I am also frustrated that I have no answers for you on a lot of these questions.""
The judge followed up with another question: Why couldn't the United States get Abrego Garcia back?

""Your Honor, I will say, for the court's awareness, that when this case landed on my desk, the first thing I did was ask my clients that very question,"" Reuveni replied. ""I've not received, to date, an answer that I find satisfactory.""
Reuveni was
put on leave
the next day and fired later that month. He has appealed his termination.
Now critics of President Trump say Reuveni's case exemplifies what will happen if the Trump administration prevails in its efforts to reshape the civil service.
Changing long standing norms around the civil service
Five months into his second term, Trump is changing long standing norms around hiring and firing federal employees as he seeks to assert far greater control over those tasked with carrying out his agenda.
A key part of this makeover is the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule ""
Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service
."" It would allow the administration to move tens of thousands of civil servants into a new category of employees who would serve at the pleasure of the president.
Politics
Thousands of federal workers would be easier to fire under Trump rule change
The administration says it's part of making the bureaucracy more efficient and more accountable.
The president's critics say Trump is politicizing the civil service, and they warn of consequences for the American people.
A focus on ""policy-influencing"" jobs
As a civil servant, Reuveni had strong job protections, including the right to due process. Federal law requires the government to go through a number of steps before taking disciplinary action, including providing notice to employees and providing an opportunity to respond.
Sponsor Message
But the Trump administration appears to have bypassed those steps in Reuveni's case, firing him less than two weeks after his appearance in court. The Justice Department declined to comment on his case.
Now,
under the administration's proposed rule
, federal employees in jobs deemed ""policy-influencing"" could lose those protections all together.
""There wouldn't need to be any reason given for just firing people,"" says Stacey Young, who worked at the Justice Department for 18 years before resigning in late January.
Young says if federal employees can be removed based on political whim, the American people will suffer. Gone would be the protections that enable ""brilliant, qualified people"" to spend their entire careers helping the American public, she says.
Concern for the government's number crunchers
Even in corners of the government that appear farthest from politics, there are concerns about the changes Trump is bringing to the civil service.
Erica Groshen, who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics back in the Obama administration, affectionately calls the economists, statisticians and others who track employment, inflation, wages and other economic indicators ""the best data nerds around.""
Even though they spend their days crunching numbers, she worries they too could be among those turned into at-will employees.
She can't figure out what the administration means when it says it plans to reclassify people in ""policy-influencing"" positions.
""It is not specific. Many of these words are open to interpretation,"" says Groshen. ""Does BLS influence policy? Yes, it's intended to.""
The Federal Reserve uses its data when choosing to raise or lower interest rates. Retirees' Social Security benefits are adjusted based on the
consumer price index
. A mistake of a tenth of a percentage point could result in overpayments or underpayments of a billion dollars, Groshen says.
Politics
Officially, 59,000 federal jobs are gone under Trump. There's more to the picture
Politics
How DOGE's push to amass data could hurt the reliability of future U.S. statistics
Outside the government, businesses write long-term contracts tied to the government's inflation data and decide where to set up production facilities based on wages and workforce availability.
Underlying all of this, Groshen says, is a shared trust that the people collecting, processing and reporting the data are doing it free from political interference. Even the perception that government data could be manipulated by politics could change that.
""The trustworthiness of the information would be lost,"" Groshen says, with huge implications for an economy that needs reliable data to stay on track.

Neither BLS nor the Office of Personnel Management answered NPR's questions about whether employees of BLS or other statistical agencies could be among those reclassified under the rule once it's finalized.
An emphasis on carrying out the president's agenda
Trump first established this category of at-will employees late in his first term, calling it Schedule F. After President Biden unraveled the effort, Trump brought it back on his first day in office, renaming it Schedule Policy/Career.
""It is meant to ensure that the administration, the president, has people who are working for him that are actually going to do the policies that he ran on, that he's articulating,"" said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought during his confirmation hearing in January. ""We think that's an important fundamental principle, and it does not mean that we have any intent to use that to fire career civil servants.""
But making it easier to fire people is in fact a stated goal.
The administration explains in the proposed rule that the creation of Schedule Policy/Career will allow agencies ""to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.""
Where this gets complicated is that actions taken by an employee could appear different to different people, says Don Kettl, former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, who opposes the change.
""Things that may look to a supervisor like somebody slow walking or sabotaging may in fact be the legitimate effort of an employee to follow … other standards of accountability,"" says Kettl, such as laws and regulations, the Constitution and professional ethics.
Fearing ""a level of sycophancy"" not seen since the 19th century
Under the proposed rule, agencies are to draw up lists of positions that could be moved into Schedule Policy/Career. Trump himself will make the final call. The administration estimates some 50,000 federal employees could be reclassified.
Stacey Young worked at the Justice Department for 18 years before resigning in January. She's the founder and executive director of Justice Connection, a group focused on helping Justice Department employees navigate challenges in Trump's second term.

""It would demand a level of sycophancy that we have not seen since the 19th century,"" she says.
Already, Young says, she hears every day about people being told to do things that are unprofessional, unethical, even illegal, or being told to resign. She says Reuveni's case reveals what can happen if they refuse.
""He was fired shortly after he stood up in court and told the truth,"" says Young.
In response to questions from NPR, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin wrote: ""DOJ attorneys are expected to uphold all legal and ethical duties including the zealous defense of our nation's interests, the enforcement of civil and criminal laws, and the vigorous defense of presidential policies and action against legal challenges.""

that it says will bring to the workforce ""only the most talented, capable and patriotic Americans.""
The plan directs agencies to stop using demographic statistics in hiring and instead focus attention on merit, competence and applicants' enthusiasm for Trump's policies.

""Identify one or two relevant Executive Orders or policy initiatives that are significant to you, and explain how you would help implement them if hired.""
Kettl doesn't think asking such a question makes sense for apolitical government roles.

may have moved large amounts of its enriched uranium.

""The Iranians at any moment now could attack Americans. That wasn't a risk we had before this strike was conducted,"" Kelly said. ""And my biggest worry here is – even though we tried to set them back in developing a nuclear weapon – this could be the moment that they make a decision to start building a bomb and further enriching that uranium.""
During his conversation with NPR's Michel Martin, Kelly also discussed the president's decision to not inform some key Democratic leaders in Congress of the strikes.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
Over the weekend,
you noted
that Iran is enriching uranium more than what they would need for power generation. They were doing something that the U.S. and other allies don't want them to do. But you also said that there was no clear present, immediate danger to the U.S. and to our troops and even to Israel with regards to nuclear capability. You said that this did not have to be done this way. But if it was effective in halting or slowing down Iran's nuclear capability, what's wrong with it?
Sen. Mark Kelly:
Well, it also might speed up their race to get a nuclear weapon. They were not actually building a weapon. Our big concern was the amount of enriched uranium that they had, which, as you noted, was much more than what they needed for a civilian nuclear power.This was a big gamble. We don't know what the endgame is here. [The Trump administration] didn't get authorization from Congress, as they should. And previous presidents chose not to do this because of the risk of getting into a wider regional war. So in my view, this was a mistake. It did not have to be done. Now it puts our troops at risk. And as I mentioned that you saw there was no imminent threat to the United States.

Martin:
It's customary and some might argue it's required for the president to at least consult the so-called Gang of Eight. That's the leaders of the House and Senate from both parties. It's the ranking members of the Intelligence Committee, from both parties on both the House and Senate side. The reporting suggests that that did not happen. A few key Republicans were notified, but no Democrats were. If that is true, what's the recourse that the Democratic leaders have here?

Kelly:
This administration operates outside of any norms frequently. So I'm not surprised that this is the way that they conducted themselves. There's probably not a lot we can do, but we can continue to push this administration on an authorization of use of military force to tell us what is now the current goal here? What is the plan that they have going forward? How are we going to protect our troops in the region? What's the regional posture going to be? The Iranians at any moment now could attack Americans. That wasn't a risk we had before this strike was conducted. And my biggest worry here is – even though we tried to set them back in developing a nuclear weapon – this could be the moment that they make a decision to start building a bomb and further enriching that uranium.

Satellites show damage to Iran's nuclear program, but experts say it's not destroyed
Martin:
If the Democrats have no recourse here, what incentive does the administration have to consult with them in the future?
Kelly:
Well, they should comply with the Constitution. And traditionally, presidents have done that. I know recently, sometimes with certain actions, when it is viewed as protecting the safety of our country, presidents can act and then they should be able to notify us. Listen to what J.D. Vance said the other day: He said we're not at war with Iran, we are at war with Iran's nuclear program. It's the same thing.
Martin:
Let me ask you about this. J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth all said yesterday that the administration did not want regime change in Iran. But then President Trump posted on social media that if the current regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be regime change? How do you understand that?
Kelly:
Well, I understand it as the president is open to regime change. Now, whether he will try to push Iran in that direction is another question. I'm sure the Israelis would like to see that. This is a dangerous moment with no end game in mind.

Despite accounting for less than 1% of the federal budget, the Park Service delivers significant economic returns. In 2023, visitor spending contributed more than $55 billion to the U.S. economy, according to a Department of Interior report.
""It's tough to tell how anyone can see this as smart politics to mess around with our national parks,"" said Desai, ""they should actually be promoted as a model of efficiency. How much economic return they bring into our local communities and support jobs and economy.""

""Under normal circumstances, it would be totally easy and allowed for me to talk to a journalist about how much I love this national park and how important it is to preserve it. Nowadays, we're stifled, and we're afraid to speak,"" he said.
The ranger said many colleagues have been fired or accepted the government's deferred resignation offer. The result, he said, is less morale for productivity.
""Try telling a park ranger who works and sweats all day that their job is low productivity. People that have worked for this park for 20, 25 years, they're looking around and saying, 'I'm going to go find another job.' It's because they're so beaten down by this onslaught of attacks on the mission of the Park Service.""
NPR reached out to the National Park Service for an interview. In a written statement, the Office of Public Affairs said, ""It's not unusual or unique to this year for questions to come up about staffing or for the staffing needs to fluctuate. As in other years, we are working hard to make it another great year for visitors.""
But park staff warn that having fewer rangers on duty is more than a staffing issue, it's a safety issue.
""This is the time of year when people die in the desert because people's bodies aren't adjusted and adjusted for that heat,"" the ranger who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ""we're at risk of having those kinds of tragedies occur because there are fewer people out protecting you."" The statement from the Park Service urged visitors to plan ahead and directed people to an NPS link about how to prevent heat-related illnesses.
In addition to visitor safety, the ranger says that the protection of the park's ecosystems is also being neglected — including the conservation efforts of biologists and archaeologists — potentially threatening ecosystems already vulnerable to climate change.

""That suggests the Court's determination of the detention issues is little more than an academic exercise,"" Holmes wrote in her opinion.
Still, she went on to explain, the principle of due process requires everyone accused of a federal crime to be afforded a presumption of innocence.
Prosecutors argue Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status from Texas across the U.S. between 2016-2025.
The defense says that the charges are to distract from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's case.

The U.S. military carried out its attack against Iran's nuclear program early on Sunday, local time. Code-named ""Operation Midnight Hammer,"" the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers carrying massive 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs known as Massive Ordnance Penetrators.

It appears that a dozen of the bombs were used to strike Iran's deeply buried enrichment site at Fordo. Two weapons were also used to strike an underground centrifuge facility at Iran's main enrichment site in Natanz.
Concurrent with the bombings, a U.S. submarine launched more than two dozen cruise missiles. Those weapons hit buildings and tunnel entrances at a third nuclear site at Isfahan.

""Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated,"" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during a Pentagon press conference on Sunday. ""The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant.""
Both Lewis and Albright say that the strikes themselves may well have been effective, although it is difficult to say for sure. Satellite imagery shows six deep holes in the ground around Fordo and ashy debris over much of the site. Albright believes that bunker-busters were used to try and strike at the enrichment facility's ventilation system, along with the main hall where uranium-enriching centrifuges were kept.

""I think the purpose of the attack was to take out centrifuges and infrastructure and they feel they accomplished that,"" Albright says.
But as evidence that the strikes may have missed the uranium stocks, both Albright and Lewis point to commercial satellite imagery from the days before the strike. The images show trucks at two key sites — Isfahan and Fordo. The trucks appear to be sealing tunnels that serve as entrances to underground facilities used to store uranium, possibly in anticipation of an American attack.
An image supplied by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey shows trucks at the entrance of the Fordo enrichment facility the day before a U.S. strike on the site. Experts believe Iran could have spirited away its supply of highly enriched uranium in advance of the attacks.

Both experts believe Iranians could have also moved their enriched uranium out of the sites in the run-up to the U.S. strikes.
""There were trucks seen in imagery apparently hauling stuff away,"" Albright says. ""One would assume that any enriched uranium stocks were hauled away.""
The International Atomic Energy Agency had assessed that Iran has more than 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium 235 — enough for around 10 bombs, according to independent experts. That 60% enriched uranium is carried in relatively small containers that could fit easily into cars, says Albright.
Although Albright believes the program has been substantially set back, he thinks it could still be reconstituted.
Albright says Iran may also have thousands of uranium-enriching centrifuges that were never installed in Natanz and Fordo.  It might be possible to move the uranium to another, covert facility, where it could be enriched to the required 90% for a nuclear weapon in a relatively short period of time. Even then, Iran would have to take further steps to fashion the uranium into a weapon.
""The program has been seriously set back, but there's a lot of odds and ends,"" Albright says.  Ultimately he thinks the only way to truly end Iran's nuclear program is through additional nuclear inspections by international monitors and cooperation from the Iranian regime, probably through some kind of diplomatic agreement.

""It was not an attack on Iran, it was not an attack on the Iranian people, this wasn't a regime change move,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on CBS'

He also said that he empathized with Americans who are ""exhausted"" by years-long U.S. involvement in the Middle East — but the difference, he argued, is that ""now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America's national security objectives.

Article I grants the ability to declare war solely to Congress — though they have largely been cut out of military planning by presidents in the decades since the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
Top Democrats were kept in the dark about the mission until after U.S. forces left Iranian airspace, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly, and many Democrats say Trump illegally ordered the strike without congressional approval.
Virginia Democrat, Sen. Tim Kaine said on CBS Sunday that Trump's actions escalated the risk for American troops in the region and that lawmakers should have been involved from the start — and should have a say in what happens next.
""The [War Powers Act] says if you initiate hostilities without congressional authorization, even a single member of the House or Senate can force a vote on the Senate floor,"" Kaine said. ""There is no doubt that the U.S. sending this massive set of Tomahawk missiles and B-2 bombers and bunker busters on three Iranian nuclear sites is hostilities.""

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who has been sharply critical of the Trump administration's intervention, was also quoted in the Dodgers statement.
""These last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy,"" she said. ""My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another — that's what makes this the greatest city in the world.""

The financial pledge came one day after the Dodgers found themselves in a war of words with immigration authorities.
On Thursday morning, several vehicles were seen parked near the stadium and five people in tactical gear were gathered nearby,
according to LAist

For nearly four years, Dr. Maya Bass's commute included a monthly plane ride from Philadelphia to Oklahoma to provide abortions at a clinic there. Starting in 2018, she took these trips even though flying made her nauseous and she had to use vacation time from her regular job. Bass was motivated to fill a gap: Oklahoma — like all parts of the U.S. outside of a fraction of metropolitan areas —
has long had a shortage of abortion providers
.

Bass trained in abortion care the year before in medical school, during a rotation at a Planned Parenthood.
There, she realized the connection between an abortion provider and patient can be deep. ""I want to be that provider who lets people feel heard and helps break that stigma,"" she says.

The Network: Saint-o-tec
Since the 1970s, legal abortions in the U.S. have taken place at brick-and-mortar facilities across the country, like the one where Bass practiced in Oklahoma. But that began to change in the early 2020s. Between the COVID pandemic and the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning
Roe v. Wade
, doctors had to rethink what a safe abortion looked like. The evidence for how to have
safe and effective abortions outside the clinical setting
was waiting for them.
A Medication Revolution, Despite Barriers
If what you picture when you think of an abortion is a woman in a medical gown, undergoing a procedure, that's far from the norm today. Medication abortion — taking pills to end a pregnancy —
now makes up 63 percent of all abortions in the country
. The first time Bass counseled someone through a medication abortion, she remembers how simple and straightforward it was.
Embedded
The Network: Breaking Bread
""Being able to just tell someone how to take pills and then know that the issue they were dealing with would be resolved just felt like such a great contribution to health care,"" she recalls.
To perform a medication abortion, which is approved in the U.S. through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, Bass gave patients two drugs: misoprostol and mifepristone.
The medications each play a different role in an abortion and have different histories. Misoprostol, which causes contractions that empty the uterus, has multiple medical uses, including treating ulcers. Starting in the mid-1980s,
women in Latin America — a region that had widespread abortion restrictions — noticed that miscarriage was a side effect of misoprostol.
Underground networks emerged there to help women use the drug for abortion. In the U.S., misoprostol is prescribed off-label for abortion and other gynecological purposes.
Sponsor Message
Mifepristone, in contrast, stops the pregnancy from progressing by blocking an important hormone. It was developed in a French laboratory with the express purpose of causing abortions.
The Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 but with a caveat: doctors had to follow stringent guidelines when they prescribed medication abortion. Those came to be known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (or REMS), which are typically reserved for drugs that are highly addictive, like fentanyl, or dangerous, like cancer drugs. Mifepristone is neither.
Bass says she found some of these rules unnecessarily burdensome.
For instance, because of the REMS, patients had to schedule an appointment and come to the clinic to get the mifepristone; they couldn't pick up the pills from a pharmacy at their convenience.
Mifepristone is one of the pills used in medication abortions.

On top of the federal regulations, Bass had to follow state-level requirements from Oklahoma. One of them, which was the case for several states at the time, required patients to swallow the mifepristone in front of her.
""I have to watch you take this specific pill,"" she says. ""It is a little silly.""
But Bass supported some of the rules she had to follow. Clinics created exhaustive standards of care to comply with the REMS and to reduce their legal risk. They included a mandatory ultrasound to date the pregnancy and bloodwork to check for medical risk factors.
Bass followed up these physical exams with counseling that helped patients understand what to expect and what signs indicated something might be going wrong.
After attending all of these appointments, undergoing tests, and paying for the pills, patients went home to manage the abortion — a process that involves cramping and bleeding that can take more than 24 hours. For Bass, this introduced risk and uncertainty.
""I think a lot of our protocols are created so that we don't have to trust that our patients know when to advocate for themselves. We can just confirm, at every state of the process, that this is fine,"" she says.
Sponsor Message
Despite finding aspects of the REMS unnecessary, overall Bass considered the protocol to be good doctoring — until she encountered an alternative.
Out of the Clinic, Onto the Internet
Throughout the 2010s, American women started to lose access to doctors who could give them an abortion. During this period, states passed hundreds of new restrictions that closed clinics and shortened the time frame women had to get an abortion.
Abortion rights advocates started looking for an alternative. Elisa Wells, a public health researcher and one of the founders of the organization
Plan C
, had worked in international settings and had seen how freely available abortion pills were in some other countries.
Wells and her team started looking into access in the U.S. They discovered one place where you could purchase pills without a prescription: the internet.
""There were people in chat rooms that were asking, 'How can I get abortion pills?' And people were desperate to know this information. They couldn't afford the cost of a clinic… the $500-$600 it was going to take to get these pills,"" she says. ""And so they saw these other pills online and wondered 'Were they real? Would they arrive? Am I going to be scammed?'""
Wells and her colleagues set out to answer these questions. She found 18 websites selling pills. She recalls that the sites looked ""a little sketchy,"" but she decided to test-purchase pills anyway. She entered her credit card information and waited, doubtful that they would arrive.
But a couple weeks later a package appeared at her door. Inside were the abortion pills. ""It was amazing to me that these pills actually came,"" Wells says.
Wells had them tested at a lab to check if they were real and presented her findings at the National Abortion Federation meeting in 2017.
Sponsor Message
""There was a bit of buzz ahead of time,"" she recalls. ""People were pretty convinced that the research was gonna show that these pills were fake."" Then Wells and her team revealed the results of the lab tests:
the pills were real.
""There was an audible gasp in the room,"" Wells says. ""People realized how transformative that could be to abortion access in the United States."" She even remembers some applause.
But as news spread throughout the abortion rights community, not everyone was celebrating.
At medical conferences across the country, clinicians who supported abortion rights began having heated debates about self-managed medication abortion — getting abortion pills without a prescription and taking them without a doctor's oversight. Jen Karlin, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, became interested in the disagreement.
Self-managed medication abortion ""was starting to make some people uncomfortable… People felt it was really unsafe,"" she says. ""I wanted to talk with clinicians about this to find out what is at stake here? Are you really worried about the safety of this? And if you are, what aspect of the safety of this are you worried about?""
In 2019, Karlin turned these questions into
a study
. First, she surveyed 40 clinicians who provide abortion and asked what they thought about self-managing.

Half of these doctors believed self-managed abortions were safe, effective and empowering. Nearly half were ambivalent.
Bass, the abortion provider who regularly flew to Oklahoma, participated in the study, and she fell into this latter category. She pictured worst-case scenarios for women who self-managed. ""What if they have a septic abortion? What if they take the medication wrong and they hurt themselves?"" she says.
After the survey, Karlin gave participants a fact-sheet. It summarizes nearly two dozen peer-reviewed articles on the safety and effectiveness of people managing a medication abortion without going to a clinic or seeing a doctor.
Sponsor Message
The studies on that sheet spanned decades and the globe.
Bass later read through every article footnoted in the fact sheet, all 23 of them.
""Wow, this is real,"" she remembers thinking.
Some of the studies directly challenged the multi-step protocol Bass adhered to when prescribing abortion medication. For instance, one study found that
an ultrasound wasn't necessary
to determine patients' gestational age in early pregnancy; patients' reported last period was usually accurate enough.
Other studies
found that an in-person follow-up appointment to make sure the abortion was complete also
wasn't essential
. Together, the studies suggested that the extensive safety measures doctors followed weren't necessary for all patients.
Though many of the participants in Karlin's study were struck by the fact-sheet's overwhelming evidence, another exercise in the study is what tended to change their minds: Karlin asked them to
reflect on their values
, in light of what they'd just learned.
One doctor realized that her discomfort with self-managed abortion wasn't really about safety. She felt that supporting her patients in person was the best part of her job, and self-managed abortion would take that away from her.
Karlin recalls the abortion provider saying, ""I went into this trying to provide quality care, evidence-based care… But then I realized that it's not about me, it's actually about centering the patient.""
Several participants, including Bass, realized that requiring a doctor to be involved actually limited abortion access.
The Pandemic Greases the Wheels
The evidence summarized in Karlin's fact sheet had been around for decades. But it took a global pandemic for that research to translate into policy.
COVID-19 made in-person contact risky, so, Karlin says, ""All of a sudden, the health care profession is saying… 'Do we really need that person to come in and do that test… that ultrasound?' And lo and behold, there's all this evidence already out there that no, they don't.""
Sponsor Message
In 2020, the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the FDA for putting doctors and abortion patients at risk. In response, the FDA walked back its regulations.
In 2021, the FDA announced that it would
stop enforcing the REMS for mifepristone
— more than two decades after the regulations had been introduced. Patients were no longer federally required to go to a clinic to get abortion pills. They could simply fill out a form online or attend a virtual appointment and then get the pills mailed to them.
During the pandemic, Karlin returned to the doctors she had surveyed in 2019 to see if their views about self-managed abortion had shifted. Some told her they were now even more convinced it was safe for patients to have abortions with less medical oversight because they'd seen the evidence through their patients' experiences.
Half of the people she had surveyed who had thought it was necessary to do an ultrasound to determine gestational age no longer did. The fraction of clinicians who believed patients needed an ultrasound to make sure the abortion was complete also dropped, down to 5 percent.
Even after the FDA revised its policies, only about two-thirds of states allow telehealth for medication abortion. But it was still a dramatic shift.
Although some doctors would prefer to see patients in person, the shift to telehealth got many clinicians thinking outside of the box on how to create access to abortion despite barriers. It's an approach they would use again when abortion seekers faced another barrier to clinic access.
The Fall of Roe
After participating in Karlin's study and changing her mind about self-managed medication abortion, Bass looked for ways to support people who took pills on their own.
In the fall of 2019, she joined a group of clinicians who were establishing the
Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline
, or the M+A Hotline.
Sponsor Message
Bass took an 18-hour shift, two to four times a month. In some ways the calls on the hotline were similar to the counseling she'd been doing in a clinic.

""Most of what we do is reassure,"" Bass says ""I would say the vast majority of the calls I'm dealing with are people just being like, 'Hey, can you tell me if it worked? Or can you tell me if this is too much bleeding?'""
Bass was surprised to find that the conversations on the hotline could feel more intimate than those in the clinic. She thinks patients open up more because both they and the doctor are anonymous.
Bass remembers one woman who called in the middle of the night confiding in her, saying: ""I haven't told anybody. I feel so alone. I don't know anybody else to talk to.""
""Those experiences are why I kept doing it,"" Bass says. ""Because it's very infrequent that you feel like you can make that much of an impact on a person.""
After
Roe
was overturned in 2022, Oklahoma banned abortion, and the clinic there where Bass worked stopped providing abortions. Her monthly trips stopped. Unable to practice in person, the hotline gave her a sense of purpose.
It also changed her understanding of why someone would self-manage their abortion. Before joining the hotline, she assumed self-managing was an act of desperation, a last resort. But that wasn't always the case.
She got calls from women in states with abortion protections, who opted to self-manage because they found it more convenient or affordable.
Bass knows that self-managed abortion can't replace all abortions – for instance, emergency cases or certain medical risk factors still require a clinician. And sometimes people just want a doctor involved. But the hotline led her to appreciate doctoring in a de-medicalized setting without unnecessary ultrasounds or bloodwork. For the first time, she was able to
care for people
having an abortion without politics shaping the process.

""It feels like I'm just on the cutting edge of medicine,"" she says. ""I'm practicing evidence-based medicine that is the leading edge of what reproductive healthcare might look like.""
In the last few years, the broader medical community, including the World Health Organization, has
declared self-managed abortion to be a safe and effective
method in the first trimester.
Many American doctors agree. In 2024, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
put out a statement in support of self-managed abortion
. It called on doctors to educate themselves and provide support for patients who do it.
Since the Supreme Court overturned
Roe
, the hotline has only grown. It now has dozens of volunteers, including clinicians as well as people who provide logistical support. The hotline gets thousands of calls and texts every month.

Other doctors contributed to a demedicalized model in another way — using telehealth to prescribe pills from states with abortion protections, called shield laws, to people in states with restrictions or bans.
Doctors' embrace of telehealth has led to an increase in the number of abortions in the U.S. In fact, research has shown that
telehealth is one of the main reasons for this rise
.
But access to these demedicalized options may be more fragile than it seems.
In her study, Karlin found that some clinicians weren't swayed to support self-managed abortion. It wasn't because they thought self-managed or telehealth abortion was dangerous –
they worried about the political consequences
.
""When and if something goes wrong — which it will, because with medicine, something goes wrong eventually — they were worried that that would be used by politicians to try to limit reproductive autonomy further,"" Karlin says.
That prediction has borne out. In 2022, the sister of Louisiana state Sen. Thomas Pressly was secretly drugged with abortion pills by her husband. Sen. Pressly then introduced a bill in Louisiana to make mifepristone and misoprostol ""controlled, banned substances."" The bill passed in 2024, making the drugs much harder to get, even for doctors. And possession of them without a prescription can result in jail time.
Sponsor Message
States have also sued
shield law providers
— doctors who prescribe abortion pills to states with abortion restrictions.
In May, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the FDA to review regulations on mifepristone, citing
a paper from a conservative think tank
that calls for restoring earlier restrictions on the drug and reconsidering the FDA's approval of mifepristone altogether. Medical experts have criticized the analysis in the paper, which hasn't been peer reviewed and reports higher serious adverse effects of the pill than was found in dozens of prior studies.
Despite these efforts to increase restrictions, NPR's reporting indicates that self-managed abortion, and the means to get support, is spreading in an informal, person-to-person way that might be outside government control. Sources shared stories of older sisters who had self-managed before helping their little sister through it, people getting pills and advice from their hairdresser, and several examples of people who had been supported by abortion doulas — someone who supports people through the process of self-managing — training to become doulas themselves.
Dee Redwine, an American who worked for 30 years in Latin America for Planned Parenthood Global, sees a pattern unfolding that she'd witnessed abroad. She learned about self-managed medication abortions in the 1990s and saw the use of misoprostol sweep across Latin America. She says when it comes to self-managed medication abortions in the U.S., ""There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.""
""That wave is coming. It's here. It's like crashing over the shores of the United States. It was… moved along much faster because of the
Dobbs
decision. And it is going to change entirely the landscape of abortion, just like it did globally,"" she says.
As Redwine sees it, the
Dobbs
decision matters for abortion access, but not in a straightforward way.

Dobbs
world is that if it goes the way that I think it will, which is what I saw in Latin America, in some ways abortion ironically will become more accessible, but less legal.""

The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved seven B-2 stealth bombers and also included at least one submarine, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon press conference.
Caine said the mission, dubbed ""Operation Midnight Hammer,"" represented the largest B-2 strike in U.S. history, involving more than 125 aircraft — including decoy flights — and saw 75 precision guided weapons dropped on the sites. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said.

Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications,"" Caine said.

Saturday's attack marks the first act of direct military involvement by the U.S. in the rapidly escalating conflict between Iran and Israel.
It included a strike on the heavily-fortified Fordo nuclear site, according to Trump, which is located roughly 300 feet under a mountain about 100 miles south of Tehran. It's a move that Israel has been lobbying the U.S. to carry out, given that only the U.S. has the kind of powerful
""bunker buster""
bomb capable of reaching the site. Known as the GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), the bomb can only be transported by one specific U.S. warplane, the B-2 stealth bomber, due to its immense 30,000 pound weight.
A U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly told NPR that senior Democratic leadership was notified of the strike right before Trump's social media post. The Army Ops Center notified senior Army leaders around the same time. It is unclear when senior Republican leadership was informed.

Several prominent Democrats criticized the military action on Saturday, with Rep.

""It is impossible to know at this stage whether this operation accomplished its objectives,"" Himes continued.
A turning point
The U.S. carried out the strike despite years of promises by Trump to keep the country from entangling itself in another Middle East conflict. Yet Trump has also said it is paramount that Iran never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.
National Security
The U.S. may have used 'bunker buster' bombs in Iran. Here's what to know about them
Trump initially sought to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran — one to replace the Obama-era agreement that he abandoned, despite Iran's apparent compliance, in 2018. But in the days after Israel's initial strikes on Iran earlier this month, he grew increasingly vocal in his opposition to Iran and the possibility it could attack U.S. assets in the region.
Trump had called for Iran's ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"" and boasted on social media that the U.S. has ""complete and total control of the skies over Iran."" In a separate
post
earlier this month, he threatened Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
saying
the Iranian leader's location had been identified.
""He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" Trump wrote. ""But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.""

Iran has responded with a barrage of missile and drone strikes aimed at Israel. The Israeli military says it has intercepted many of those projectiles, but not all. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says dozens have been killed, and hundreds more wounded.
Iran has long defended its nuclear program as peaceful, but Netanyahu has argued it poses a risk not just for his nation, but for the U.S. as well.
For its part,
the U.S. intelligence community
has said it believes Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003, following the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard relayed that guidance as recently as March during an appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
But earlier this month, Trump contradicted Gabbard, telling reporters on his way back from the G7 summit in Canada, ""I don't care what she said. I think they [the Iranians] were very close to having it."""

Frank Langfitt has covered the world. Now he reports for NPR as a roving correspondent, focusing on stories that help us understand a changing America.
Recently, he covered both the military parade that brought tanks and armored personnel carriers rolling through the nation's capital, as well as the No Kings protests where people in dozens of cities across the country rallied against politicization of the armed forces by someone they called a would-be autocrat.
Many have dubbed the day as a split-screen moment - and for Frank, going to two events on the same day gave him the sense of looking at America with a lens he had often examined other countries in the past.
There are events that become a Rorschach test that brings out America's political and cultural divisions in bold relief. You could look at that day as an example of a divided America — a moment where our differences were placed in pretty stark relief. But perhaps by being in both places on the same day you see something different.

NEW ORLEANS — A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state's public school classrooms is unconstitutional.
The ruling Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian.
The mandate has been touted by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.

Supreme Court blocks creation of religious charter school in Oklahoma
""This is a resounding victory for the separation of church and state and public education,"" said Heather L. Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""With today's ruling, the Fifth Circuit has held Louisiana accountable to a core constitutional promise: Public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith.""
The plaintiffs' attorneys and Louisiana disagreed on whether the appeals court's decision applied to every public school district in the state or only the districts party to the lawsuit.
""All school districts in the state are bound to comply with the U.S. Constitution,"" said Liz Hayes, a spokesperson for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which served as co-counsel for the plaintiffs.
The appeals court's rulings ""interpret the law for all of Louisiana,"" Hayes added. ""Thus, all school districts must abide by this decision and should not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.""
Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit. Murrill added that she would appeal the ruling, including taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
Law
Judge blocks Louisiana law requiring display of Ten Commandments in classrooms
The panel of judges reviewing the case was unusually liberal for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents.
The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.
Sponsor Message
The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law last June.
Landry said in a statement Friday that he supports the attorney general's plans to appeal.
Religion
Louisiana mandate stirs debate about the Ten Commandments and their purpose
""The Ten Commandments are the foundation of our laws — serving both an educational and historical purpose in our classrooms,"" Landry said.
Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.
Similar laws have been challenged in court.
A group of Arkansas families filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month challenging a near-identical law passed in their state. And comparable legislation in Texas currently awaits Gov. Greg Abbott's signature.
In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin."

Employers continued to hire at a solid pace in June, which could encourage the Federal Reserve to take its time in cutting interest rates.
U.S. employers added 147,000 jobs last month, according to
a report from the Labor Department
on Thursday. That's roughly in line with the average pace of hiring over the last 12 months. Job gains for April and May were also revised up by a total of 16,000 jobs.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, from 4.2% in May, as 130,000 people dropped out of the workforce.
Job gains were concentrated in health care and state and local government last month, while the federal government continued to shed jobs, cutting 7,000 in June.
Sponsor Message
Factories shed jobs
Despite the healthy job gains overall, there are signs of weakness — especially in the manufacturing sector.
Factories cut another 7,000 jobs last month after cutting a similar number the month before. President Trump's tariffs continue to weigh on the manufacturing sector. A
report from the Institute for Supply Management
this week showed factory activity shrank in June for the fourth month in a row. Many of the factory managers surveyed for the report blamed Trump's import taxes for a drop in factory business.
""The tariff mess has utterly stopped sales globally and domestically,"" said an unnamed purchasing manager quoted in the ISM report. ""Everyone is on pause. Orders have collapsed.""
Fed may not need to cut rates
For the Fed, the narrow but consistent job gains suggest policymakers will not be in a hurry to cut interest rates.
""We watch very carefully for signs of unexpected weakness"" in the labor market, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday during a central bankers' panel in Portugal. ""We see a gradual cooling but we don't really see that yet.""
Powell and his colleagues do expect to lower their benchmark interest rate later this year.
Trump has been critical of the Fed chairman
for not moving more aggressively."

An Alabama food bank leader anticipates a major increase in people needing to turn to groups like hers to cover their basic needs if the massive tax and spending legislation backed by President Trump clears Congress.
Linda Jones, the co-founder of the food bank Alabama Childhood Food Solutions, says her program that now distributes food to nearly 2,600 kids each week has already seen a 30% increase over last year. Overall, her organization now feeds close to 1,200 families in central Alabama — doubling last year's numbers.
""It's just growing by leaps and bounds. And if this new bill gets passed, which I feel like it probably will, we will probably start doubling even more so,"" Jones told NPR's Michel Martin.
Sponsor Message
Speaking on
Morning Edition
, Jones said high food prices are driving the increase. ""We've had people come in and said that they got food stamps, but they don't give them anything but bread and milk. And by the time they get out of the grocery store, that's it. So that's where they come to us to get other food,"" she added.
The bill would make major changes to the country's social safety net. Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are targeted for major cuts. Millions of people stand to lose food assistance if the House passes the bill after it cleared the Senate earlier this week, according to an
estimate from the Congressional Budget Office
of the House's first version of the bill.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Michel Martin:
Why do you think it's gone up so much?
Linda Jones:
I think it's because of the food prices. Like eggs, $8 a dozen. Who can afford that? And milk is so high. Everything is so high. We've had people come in and say that they got food stamps even, but that doesn't give them anything but bread and milk. And by the time they get out of the grocery store, that's it. So that's where they come to us, to get other food.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
One of the things that this bill would do, especially with Medicaid and SNAP, it would now be linked to work requirements.
Jones:
Yes. And I don't know how that's going to work because some of the people agree on it. Some of them could work. And I agree with that. Those that are capable of working should work. But some of them, you look at them and you think, man, they could go out and go to work. But once you start talking to them, it's a different story entirely.
Martin:
It's my understanding that a lot of people who get Medicaid and/or food stamps already work. Is that true?
Jones:
Yes, I think so.
Martin:
So tell me more about that. If they were already working, what's the story? Why do they need this food help?
Jones:
Some come in and get food. And they say they're like a dollar or two [off] to qualify for food stamps, or they've lost their food stamps because they moved.
We had some children in our backpack ministry where this young boy was getting food every week. He came in and asked the teacher if he could possibly get his bag early because they had no food in the house whatsoever. So, come to find out, there was a dad that had seven children whose wife took the youngest child and left him abandoned with the other children. And this man and his family were just hanging on by a thread. But we came in and we're giving them food now monthly to help him with his grocery bill, at least.
Martin:
And the backpack ministry, remind us what that is.
Jones:
The backpack ministries is where we feed children that don't get enough food during the week at school and we give them food for the weekends.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
Do you see waste, fraud and abuse in the system from where you are?
Jones:
From my standpoint, no. Mostly what we see are poor, poor people. We try to make every dollar we can count to be able to buy that food. We have an audit every year. And this year, they came in and they said that 97% is what we use for all our food and stuff. Only 3% is used for other things.
Martin:
So it's only like 3% administrative costs, which is a very narrow margin. So I guess you're operating mostly on volunteers, right?
Jones:
Yes, we have over 900 volunteers come in through our distribution center once a year.

There's an economic fantasy you sometimes hear in D.C. It often gets trotted out when politicians are trying to add billions or trillions to the national debt. They claim that all the new spending — whether it's tax cuts or corporate subsidies or infrastructure projects — will be worth it in the end because we will supercharge economic growth.
This fantasy recurs again and again, because economic growth is a potent force. Over the next few decades, tiny changes in how fast our economy grows could decide the fate of the federal government — whether we can bring the massive national debt under control or whether we spiral into a fiscal crisis.

60 Minutes
interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during last fall's elections.

The announcement Tuesday from Paramount Global, CBS' parent company, that it had
settled President Trump's private lawsuit
over a
60 Minutes
interview was welcome news for its controlling owner, Shari Redstone.
But it represented yet another bitter pill for independent journalism to swallow.
The
CBS Eye blinked
.
Disney's Mouse didn't roar
.
The Washington Post
— a newspaper whose motto is ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" —
has pulled its editorial punches
.
And
The Los Angeles Time
s's owner has
thrown in his lot
with those who say the media — including his own paper — is too liberal.
What seemed possible — but hard to believe — before President Trump took office once more has now taken shape: A number of corporate and individual owners of media that promise to hold power to account have instead bowed to it. So too have the chiefs of two major social media platforms — among the richest people on the planet.
Sponsor Message
The $16 million settlement over an interview CBS'
60 Minutes
conducted last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris smooths the path for Redstone and Paramount to secure the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to sell the company to Skydance Media, a deal bankrolled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally. The FCC must sign off on the transfer of the broadcast licenses for CBS' local TV stations for the deal to go through.
Trump's legal team had alleged that CBS's decision last fall to air different parts of Harris's answer to a question about the Israel/Hamas conflict on
60 Minutes
and
Face The Nation
constituted election interference. They said it had inflicted emotional harm on Trump. His pick to lead the FCC had initiated a formal review of complaints against CBS.
""With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,"" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team said on Wednesday. ""CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.""
Outside legal experts, by and large, see it differently. They almost uniformly call Trump's claims spurious, saying CBS's editorial decisions are protected by the First Amendment.
Sponsor Message
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a frequent Trump defender, publicly
argued that the lawsuit was likely unfounded
.
""The decision to settle a case with no legal merit obviously comes squarely from the corporate suite, not from anybody at CBS News,"" former CBS News president Andrew Heyward tells NPR. ""To me, the critical issue is whether
60 Minutes
can hold onto its tradition of fierce editorial integrity under new management.""
Indeed, CBS chief and Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks focused on the company's larger financial interests at a Paramount shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. ""Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,"" Cheeks said. He noted that a legal settlement lets a company move on with its business.
Emotions ran high at a
60 Minutes
staff meeting Wednesday morning. A person who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal company matters says people were more doleful than angry. The payout came as no surprise; corporate executives had telegraphed that there would certainly be a settlement. Some were relieved that Paramount had declined to issue what they saw as an unwarranted apology.
Trump speaks about free speech but lawsuits serve as warning signal
Paramount and CBS are following what is — by now — a well worn path of corporate deference to Trump.
The owners of the
Washington Post
and the
L.A. Times
— the billionaire entrepreneurs Jeff Bezos and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong — separately killed editorials drafted to endorse Harris shortly before the election and completely overhauled their editorial pages to be less likely to criticize Trump. Both men have significant business dealings before the Trump administration.

The Walt Disney Co., parent of ABC, promised to pay Trump's presidential foundation $15 million and $1 million in legal fees over anchor George Stephanopoulos's mischaracterization of legal proceedings against Trump. It also issued a note of regret.
Meta paid even more — $25 million — to resolve a suit from Trump over his removal from Facebook after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Outside lawyers say it had an even stronger case than Disney.
Last year, as he campaigned for the White House, Trump promised to
protect free speech
and
end censorship
. In March, in a presidential address to Congress,
Trump said he had done just that
.
In recent days, by contrast, Trump has
threatened to sue CNN and the
New York Times
over their disclosure of preliminary intelligence reports suggesting the strikes on Iran were not as debilitating to its nuclear weapons program as the administration said. Neither has retreated from its reporting. On Tuesday, the administration also
suggested it might prosecute CNN
for reporting on an app that would alert users to activity by immigration authorities. CNN noted that any iPhone user can download it through the App Store.
Meanwhile, the
Des Moines Register
's parent company, Gannett Co., is fighting litigation Trump brought in Iowa over a poll days before the election showing Harris with a lead in that state. Trump won handily. Even so, that does not make for a legal wrong, media lawyers and legal observers say.
""A cold wind just blew through every newsroom""
Free speech and press advocates blanketed Paramount with condemnation Wednesday for settling the
60 Minutes
case.
""A cold wind just blew through every newsroom this morning,"" said Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. ""Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media's editor-in-chief.""
Sponsor Message
Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Paramount would have prevailed in any suit. He said the settlement marked a sad day for press freedoms.
""This was a frivolous lawsuit and the payment being described as a 'settlement' bears no relation to Paramount's actual legal exposure in the case, which was negligible,"" Jaffer said. ""Now Trump's presidential library will be a permanent monument to Paramount's surrender, a continual reminder of its failure to defend freedoms that are essential to our democracy.""
Some legal scholars have told NPR they consider the settlement a form of extortion, relying upon the president's powers and influence over the executive branch.
Several Democratic lawmakers have called for hearings or investigations. ""Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval,""
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden posted on X
. ""When Democrats retake power, I'll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.""
Convictions on bribery charges can be hard to secure and are often tossed out, says Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. CBS simply had more to lose than Trump should the case have gone to court, he says, arguing that the legal discovery process could've turned up evidence that the media company would rather keep hidden.
""Every organization has someone within it that has said something that looks terrible to its reputation,"" he tells NPR.
Yet there is no reason to believe that legal settlements guarantee future peace with a president who has long identified ""fake news"" as the enemy.
Elon Musk's social media platform X, previously Twitter, agreed to pay $10 million to resolve its decision under prior ownership to kick Trump off after the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol. The two men
recently tangled
over the president's budget proposals; now Trump has raised the prospect of having the budget-slashing initiative that Musk led
turn its attention to federal contracts and subsidies
currently benefiting Musk's ventures."

Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, said it has agreed to pay $16 million to President Trump's foundation for his future presidential library to settle a lawsuit he filed over the editing of a
60 Minutes
interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during last fall's elections.
The settlement includes Paramount paying Trump's legal fees, according to a statement from the company late Tuesday. The settlement does not include any statement of apology or regret, Paramount said.
As part of the settlement, Paramount said,
60 Minutes
will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future after they've aired. They may be redacted due to legal or national security concerns. The suit also settled all claims by Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, who had joined Trump's suit. The White House referred comment to the president's legal team.
Sponsor Message
Trump declared victory in holding ""the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,"" according to a spokesperson for his legal team, who said Paramount and CBS had no choice but to settle. ""President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.""
Legal observers spanning the ideological spectrum say Trump's lawsuit — which had sought $20 billion in damages — spuriously alleges election interference over the kind of discretionary editorial choices that routinely confront broadcast journalists.
As a result, the settlement represents a bitter blow to CBS News and its crown jewel
60 Minutes
— not for what it broadcast or reported, but for a deal struck by corporate executives many layers above them.
Trump's lawsuit centers on a
60 Minutes
interview conducted last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, shown above. It used different portions of Harris' answer to the same question for two different shows.

Yet Paramount's controlling owner, Shari Redstone, has billions of dollars at stake as she seeks to close a sale of the company to Skydance Media. The deal is under formal review by the Federal Communications Commission, now led by Trump's pick as chairman, Brendan Carr.
""This is protection money""
Last fall, CBS News used one part of Harris's answer to a question on Gaza from
60 Minutes
correspondent Bill Whitaker for
Face The Nation
, and another for the lengthier treatment on
60 Minutes
itself.
In the case, filed before a
Trump-appointed federal judge
in Eastern Texas, Trump's legal team argued that CBS engaged in ""unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive and substantial news distortion.""
""Am I supposed to take that seriously?"" asks University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias, who specializes in First Amendment issues. ""I do not understand how suits that are arguably frivolous or meritless — that have very little substance and wouldn't amount to large judgment if you went to trial — are then settled for millions of dollars.""
""It's laughable and it's an affront to the First Amendment,"" Northwestern University law professor Heidi Kitrosser says of Trump's case. ""His concern first and foremost is to intimidate the press.""
Paramount's settlement appears to be directly modeled on that reached with Trump by ABC News's parent company, the Walt Disney Co.
Disney paid $15 million to a future foundation and museum for Trump to settle a lawsuit over incorrect remarks by anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump had been found liable for rape in a civil suit. He hadn't; A New York City jury rejected that count but found Trump liable for sexual assault. Disney's attorneys feared they could lose if the case went to trial, though media lawyers said it was likely to prevail on the merits.
Meta paid $25 million to resolve a suit from Trump over his removal from Facebook after the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol, though it had an even stronger case than Disney, outside lawyers say.

interview with Harris, which was one of Trump's demands. Carr did so after reviving a complaint against CBS that had been filed by a conservative public interest group. Carr's Democratic predecessor had dismissed the complaint in her final days in office.
CBS had previously refused to release the raw materials, citing the importance of maintaining journalistic independence from governmental interference.
Shortly after Carr's request, CBS announced it was legally required to comply, though the network has challenged the agency's requests and demands in the past. (One such appeal, over a complaint filed by the late former President Jimmy Carter, reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981.)

After receiving the unedited material, the FCC publicly posted
links
to it and CBS swiftly followed suit. The network also published a statement that said the material showed there had been no bias in how they presented the Harris interview. Carr said he would keep a review open for six weeks to allow the public to weigh in.
Carr told Fox News
that day that an investigation was warranted under ""news distortion"" concerns because CBS broadcast different answers on two different programs to the same question. ""The [FCC]
policy
says you can't, you know, swap answers out to make it look like somebody said something entirely different,"" Carr said. ""Clearly, the words of the answers were very different.""
The transcripts
appear to show that CBS editors pulled from slightly different points in the same response, with Harris speaking vaguely as she attempted to sidestep controversy over the incendiary issue of the Israel-Hamas.
After the transcript's release,
Trump denounced CBS
. ""CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable 'NEWS' show should be immediately terminated,"" Trump posted online. (CBS as a network doesn't hold a license; the local stations on which it is broadcast do.)
""That's not a veiled threat — it's an open threat,"" Tobias says of Trump's remarks. ""Look at what's already poured in — millions into his coffers [from media companies].""
Tobias puts the settlement in the context of the FCC's new agenda under Carr, with agency reviews of programming on ABC, CBS and NBC. Carr has also ordered a formal investigation into whether corporate underwriting spots aired by NPR and PBS have evolved into full-fledged commercials and says he believes Congress should eliminate funding for the public broadcasters. (The two networks say they take pains to abide by federal law and the FCC's own guidance.)

Some of the network's stars had openly lobbied Paramount not to settle. Others were
anticipating it with a sense of mourning
. Tobias suggested they didn't stand a chance.
Carr ""is leveraging Trump's power and the whole force of the government to come down on major aspects of the press,"" Tobias said. ""Who's going to stand up to Trump? Nobody. Certainly not the Congress — not the Senate or the House. So you've got the press.
""But now the press, you're seeing them operating on their own interests. And they're settling these cases that are not very strong on the merits."""

Luxury athletic brand Lululemon is suing Costco, accusing the wholesale club giant of copying several of its signature designs and offering them at a lower price under its Kirkland Signature brand.
In a lawsuit filed Friday, Lululemon said that ""given the success"" of its products, ""some companies have replicated or copied Plaintiffs' proprietary apparel designs to create what are colloquially known in the fashion world as 'knockoffs' or 'dupes.' ""
""The Infringing Products create an improper association with Plaintiffs' authentic products,"" the complaint continued, citing the example of the hashtag ""LululemonDupes"" on social media, which helps users find reviews and sources of similar products at a lower price.

Main Character of the Week
Chinese manufacturers on TikTok claim they make the world's luxury goods. Is that true?
The lawsuit also accuses Costco of illegally trading on Lululemon's ""reputation, goodwill and sweat equity by selling unauthorized and unlicensed apparel"" based on the athleisure brand's design patents.
In a statement to NPR, Lululemon said: ""As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development, and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary.""
Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lululemon was founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1998 and has emerged as a leading retailer in the fashionable athletic space. With single items regularly ringing in at more than $100, the brand is heavily associated with the athleisure style of workout gear. Its revenues topped $10 billion last year.
Costco, which is membership only, has developed a devoted following for its private label Kirkland Signature brand, which makes competing products of name-brand products, usually at a far lower price to customers. Costco's revenue totaled $254.5 billion in fiscal 2024."

Waffle House had
added the surcharge in February
as an
outbreak of avian flu
forced the culling of tens of millions of egg-laying chickens, sending prices to record highs.  Since then, both wholesale and retail prices have begun to normalize, although retail egg prices in May were still up more than 40% from a year ago.

Why the egg price hike resonated so much
The spike in egg prices was a challenge for Waffle House, which serves about 272 million eggs in a typical year. The Georgia-based chain operates more than 2,000 restaurants, and its 24-hour diners are such a fixture in the southeast that FEMA uses an informal ""

The temporary egg surcharge was its own sort of misery index as the nation vented its frustration with runaway food prices. Other breakfast chains like
Denny's also added surcharges
when eggs were in short supply.
A Waffle House outlet in Houston warned customers of a 50 cent surcharge on eggs in February.  The chain dropped the surcharge four months later as egg prices began to normalize.

""The good news is, as far as the supply goes, [it's] much better than it was let's say just even six months ago.""
Waffle House quietly dropped its surcharge a month ago, before trumpeting the news on Tuesday. Denny's says it dropped its own surcharge in late May, calling the move ""great news for Grand Slam lovers everywhere.""
The American Egg Board, which represents farmers, notes that rebuilding the nation's egg supply will take time.  As of June 1, there were about 285 million egg-laying hens in the country.

The
Senate's version
of the giant tax and spending bill might eliminate tax credits for electric vehicle purchases even sooner than the House version.
The
House bill
called for those tax credits to end in late 2025 for some carmakers, and 2026 for others.
Business
The fate of the EV tax credits depends on the GOP's megabill
The draft that the Senate released over the weekend sets a single termination date: Sept. 30th, three months from now.
But the megabill is far from finalized. The Senate is currently voting on potential
amendments
to their version, and after that the House and Senate versions would still need to be
reconciled
.
Sponsor Message
Politics
Reconciliation is the key to unlocking Trump's agenda. Here's how it works
But for EV advocates who had hoped the Senate would extend the life of the EV tax credits, the draft released over the weekend was a blow.
""To vote for this bill as written is to effectively abandon the goal we all share of making the United States globally competitive in the mineral, battery, and vehicle production markets of the future,"" Albert Gore III, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, wrote in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned American Energy Alliance celebrated the prospect of rapidly terminating EV tax credits. ""Extending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful,"" the group's president, Tom Pyle, wrote in a statement.
In an interesting development, the nation's auto dealers — who, during the Biden administration, were
vocally skeptical
of electric vehicles — have been lobbying to keep the EV tax credits in place for longer. The National Automobile Dealers Association has urged Congress to include what they call ""a reasonable transition period.""
""An abrupt repeal of the EV tax credits would disrupt the car market and cause unnecessary consumer confusion,"" the group wrote in a statement emailed to NPR. And Carmax and Carvana, two nationwide used-vehicle giants, joined an
open letter
calling for credits to continue ""for at least the next several years,"" arguing that sudden elimination would be too disruptive to the used auto market in particular. The current tax credit includes a used vehicle credit, worth up to $4,000 per car, explicitly designed to bring EVs within reach for lower- and middle-income car shoppers.
Sponsor Message
Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), a former car dealer and a vocal critic of EVs, laid out part of the Republican argument against the tax credits in remarks on the
Senate floor
over the weekend. He raised the hypothetical example of a billionaire who decides to lease a $500,000 electric Rolls-Royce. ""The Democrats gave that billionaire a check for $7,500,"" he said. ""They say we're helping billionaires, when they're giving $7,500 checks to people who lease these cars. Sick.""
It's true that the tax credit for leasing an EV — sometimes called the lease loophole — does not have the same
income and price restrictions
as the rest of the EV tax credits.
EV tax credits were not the only green provision to get more radical cuts from the Senate's weekend draft than they did in the House bill. The Senate is considering not only
pulling tax credits for wind and solar projects
, but adding new taxes on those renewable energy sources, unless companies can prove they don't use Chinese components. And the Senate might eliminate all fees on automakers who don't comply with fuel economy rules, which environmental groups say would make those regulations toothless.
On the other hand, not every rollback of EV policy contained in the House version of the bill survived the Senate's revision process. A new yearly fee on electric vehicles and hybrids was not in the latest version (though it may return in a separate bill). Neither was a proposal to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency's rules for tailpipe emissions standards."

A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of the insolvent genetics firm 23andMe to a nonprofit run by one of the company's co-founders. The deal effectively avoids the controversial transfer of DNA data to a third party.
Business
The legal battle over the fate of 23andMe's DNA data has taken a new twist
The prospect of 23andMe's trove of genetic information on millions of people passing to the highest bidder had sparked outcry when it was announced in May that New York-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had won an auction to acquire the firm for $256 million.
23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and potential gene-based risks for disease. The company stores the data — and spit samples — and sends users an analysis of their genetic information.
Despite Regeneron's pledges to honor 23andMe's privacy policies, more than two dozen states sued to halt the deal, arguing that genetic information is a unique and fundamentally different type of property than the kind that might normally change hands in a bankruptcy sale. (Think real estate, or office furniture.)
Sponsor Message
The bidding was re-opened, and the nonprofit TTAM Research Institute won with a bid of $305 million.
TTAM Research Institute was set up in May by Anne Wojcicki, a co-founder and former CEO of 23andMe, to acquire the company's assets and use the DNA data for medical research. Some 80% of 23andMe's
more than 15 million
customers have agreed to allow their data to be used for research, according to the company.
The TTAM acronym is a nod to ""twenty-three and me."" The institute also pledged to improve privacy policies, and continue to allow customers to delete their data at will, as 23andMe already does.
In a filing late on Friday, Judge Brian Walsh of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, in St. Louis, wrote that the current structure of the deal ""involves a sale of customer data only in a technical sense.""
The states' suit had sought to ensure that consumers have full control over genetic information, which is highly personal and unchangeable.
Justin Leonard, a lawyer who represented Oregon in the states' lawsuit, said that this outcome would satisfy the states' concerns: ""It's going to be under the same privacy policies, the same cybersecurity protections, same management as it was before.""
Business
23andMe is on the brink. What happens to all its DNA data?
But not all of the states agree. The judge's ruling noted that a handful of states — California, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah — ""remain actively opposed to the sale."" Leonard says those opposed to the sale have until midnight on July 7 to be granted a stay in order to appeal.
23andMe and TTAM did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ruling.
The legal battle has centered on the risks and unknowns of selling consumers' DNA data to a third party after a bankruptcy. And for customers like Kyle, that sense of risk was heightened after 2023, when
hackers accessed
the genetic information of millions of 23andMe customers.
Sponsor Message
Kyle said he began to worry about his family's genetic data even more after a
2024 lawsuit
alleged that 23andMe had failed to notify Chinese and Ashkenazi Jewish customers that their data had been targeted and was being sold online in curated lists — a potential safety risk. Kyle's family had learned, through a 23andMe test, that one side was Ashkenazi Jews.
""It was definitely affirming,"" said Kyle, who asked NPR to use only his first name out of concern that his family may be targeted. ""And I would say we mostly forgot about it after that.""
That, in a nutshell, was the problem with 23andMe's business model: It was a one-and-done product. Once people learned about their genealogy and genetic health risks, many forgot about 23andMe, and the company struggled to attract repeat customers.
When it was announced that 23andMe would be sold to Regeneron, Kyle decided to delete his family's data altogether.
""I think historically there is a concern amongst the Jewish community for people knowing who we are, where we live and our genealogy. And if that information gets into the wrong hands it's very dangerous,"" he said.
He said he is not confident the data is guaranteed to be secure, even under TTAM Research Institute.
In his ruling, Judge Walsh wrote that the sale of genetic data ""is a scary proposition."" But he added that lawmakers had not banned it, and in this case an ""absolute prohibition"" could result in missed opportunities, although he did not spell out what those opportunities might be.
Last year, 23andMe
agreed to a settlement
in the data breach suit
without admitting wrongdoing
. Walsh wrote that the funds from the sale to TTAM Research Institute ""may be sufficient to compensate all of the company's creditors, including customers who were harmed by a data breach.""
Sponsor Message
The case casts a spotlight on the lack of laws safeguarding genetic privacy and questions about how DNA data should be considered as legal property, says Laura Coordes, an expert in bankruptcy at Arizona State University's law school.

""My hope is that the issues that this case raises and the attention that it's gotten will in turn spur some meaningful thought about data privacy protections, and those protections in a bankruptcy,"" she said.
""I do think on some level there are legislative moves that need to be made and that I would like to see,"" she said. ""That's how you ensure that you don't have all of this upheaval and all of these reactions from the state and the federal government, and the public … you work to strengthen the baseline protections in the long term."""

Trump tariff revenue soars 78%. Who's paying them?
The digital services tax, which would have affected tech giants like Google and Amazon, was set to take effect on Monday
.
But the Canadian government rescinded the levy at the last minute to appease Trump and avoid a more damaging fight with Canada's largest trading partner.
Canada's Finance Minister

Trump currently has set a 25% tax on Canadian imports not covered by the USMCA trade agreement which was negotiated during Trump's first term in office, and a 50% tax on aluminum and steel imported from Canada.
Negotiating window
The brinkmanship comes as the Trump administration is racing to reach trade deals with other major trading partners before a self-imposed deadline of July 9, when higher tariffs on dozens of countries are set to go into effect.

The deep ocean covers most of the planet. Gerard Barron wants his company to be the first to mine it.
That's been his dream since 2001, when Barron's then-tennis partner asked him to invest in a first-of-its-kind project to extract gold and other metals from a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Papua New Guinea.
""I knew very little about the ocean. I knew very little about mining,"" Barron told NPR. ""But I was curious.""
Climate
The world has no rulebook for deep-sea mining. One company is pushing forward anyway
Barron, 58, is a serial entrepreneur from Australia who always seems to be in a different time zone — calling from Vancouver, London or Dubai. He's founded companies in fields ranging from finance to industrial manufacturing.
That
first deep-sea mining
project
didn't quite go as planned. The company struggled to attract financing and went bankrupt in 2019, though not before Barron sold his stake at a profit.
Along the way, he learned about a different, potentially more lucrative, opportunity: ""The big game was this nodule field off the coast of Mexico.""
Sponsor Message
That ""big game"" is a remote stretch of the Pacific Ocean, believed to hold massive amounts of minerals like nickel and cobalt. It would become the target of his latest firm,
The Metals Company
.
Barron argues that securing access to those minerals, which are used in defense and energy technologies, could help usher in a new era of industrialization for the U.S.
"" This resource can help America become mineral independent, just like it became energy independent through shale and gas,"" he says.
That argument has caught the attention of the Trump administration. The Metals Company is now seeking approval for the project from federal regulators – the first time U.S. agencies have considered such a project.
But scientists worry about the impact of deep-sea mining on a little-studied ecosystem. And most other countries say these minerals, which fall beneath international waters, aren't even America's to mine.

What is The Metals Company?
The Metals Company is a relative newcomer to the mining industry. It was founded in 2011 and went public in 2021. It's backed by companies including the engineering firm Allseas, which designs much of The Metals Company's mining technology.
It is among a handful of mining firms eyeing the same stretch of Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii, called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The U.S. Geological Survey
has estimated
that the seabed there contains more nickel and cobalt than all known terrestrial reserves combined.
Climate
Your Next Car May Be Built With Ocean Rocks. Scientists Can't Agree If That's Good
Barron, who became CEO in 2017, says mining in the CCZ is a no-brainer. Unlike traditional mining, which extracts metals from underground, the metals in the CCZ sit right on the seabed surface, bound up in trillions of potato-shaped rocks called polymetallic nodules.
""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" Barron says. ""We can pick those nodules up and turn them into metals at a fraction of the environmental and human impacts compared to mining on land.""
Polymetallic nodules containing certain critical minerals can be found scattered across the seabed in some parts of the ocean. Pictured here are manganese nodules found off the Southeastern U.S. in 2019. ""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" says Gerard Barron, CEO of The Metals Company.

In 2022, The Metals Company tested its mining system in the miles-deep waters of the CCZ. The technology works something like a giant, remote-controlled vacuum cleaner that sucks nodules off the seafloor. In that test, the firm retrieved 3,000 tons of nodules from the seabed, a feat unmatched by most industry peers.

By operating in the remote CCZ, Barron says his company can avoid the harms of land-based mining, which can include displacing communities or clearing forest.
""This is the perfect place,"" he says ""There's no alternative [use] for this part of the seafloor. You can't grow crops there. People can't live there. It's perfect.""
Not everyone agrees.
What do critics say?
Dozens of countries have
called for a moratorium
on deep-sea mining until more is learned about potential impacts, and hundreds of marine researchers have also come out
in opposition
.
Environment
Scientists are raising the alarm about Trump's deep sea mining executive order
They say mining could damage a little-explored ecosystem where scientists still routinely discover new animal species.
""On land, we all see how destructive mining is. But on the seafloor, no one's going to see it,"" says Sheryl Murdock, an oceanographer at Arizona State University. ""So I don't think it's going to be less destructive. It's that people are going to be less aware of it.""
Murdock says deep-sea mining could destroy seabed habitat by removing the nodules on which sponges and other animals live. The operation would also create underwater plumes of sediment that may contain heavy metals, she says.
The Metals Company says its mining system is designed to limit environmental impacts. It plans to leave 15-20% of the nodules behind on the seabed, allowing some animals to recolonize the disturbed area. The firm says that its models suggest the sediment plumes would dissipate to background levels within two miles, only impacting the area immediately surrounding the mining operation.
The firm also points to
studies
finding that animal life in the CCZ is far less abundant than in many terrestrial mining hotspots.
Still, some manufacturers — including Volvo, BMW and Google — have
pledged
not to use ocean-mined minerals in their supply chains due to environmental concerns.
Some analysts also question the business case for deep-sea mining. Many EV carmakers have
shifted away
from using batteries that contain nickel and cobalt. There's currently a
global
oversupply
of those metals — even some terrestrial mines are going idle.
Andrew K. Sweetman, professor and research leader at the Lyell Centre for Earth, Marine Science, and Technology at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland explains how sample are obtained from deep in the ocean during research in 2021 on the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining. Many ocean researchers have raised concerns about the potential effects on an ecosystem that scientists still know relatively little about.

Just a few months ago, it wasn't clear any company would be mining the deep sea any time soon.

Mining in international waters is traditionally overseen by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). For more than a decade, the United Nations-affiliated group of more than 165 countries has been drafting regulations for a future deep-sea mining industry. Those regulations are still being negotiated – leaving companies like Barron's in limbo.
World
The global race for rare earth materials is on, and the U.S. is losing it
In April, Barron's fortunes changed. President Trump signed an
executive order
promoting deep-sea mining as a way for the U.S. to counter China's dominance of global mineral supplies. It also directed federal agencies to fast-track permitting for deep-sea mining projects, in both federal and international waters.
""The industry got a lifeline with the Trump executive order,"" says Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Everything else was kind of on a backwards treadmill.""
The order also put the U.S. at odds with nearly every other country.
""The area is an international possession,"" says Leticia Reis de Carvalho, Secretary-General of the ISA. ""Therefore, any activity without an authorization of the International Seabed Authority constitutes a violation of international law.""
The ISA defines these seabed minerals as the common heritage of all humans. Dozens of countries have condemned the Trump administration's unilateral approach to mining them.
The Trump administration says it's not bound by ISA rules. The U.S. is one of the few countries that never ratified the treaty that created the ISA, though past administrations have generally cooperated with it.
The executive order seems to have buoyed The Metals Company's prospects. Its stock price has more than doubled since Trump's signing. The firm has also announced $85 million-worth of new corporate
investment
.

Barron plans to seize the newfound opportunity. Days after the executive order, The Metals Company

from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to begin commercial-scale mining in international waters.
NOAA
says
it is ""committed to an expeditious review"" of the application, though an exact timeline is unclear, since the agency has never conducted such a review.
If and when The Metals Company receives approval, it will likely take
at least a year
to build out a full-scale mining system, according to the engineering firm Allseas.

Carney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.
Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.
The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.
Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a ""clear victory"" for Trump.
""At some point this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,"" Béland said.

He said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump's outbursts.
""President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executive will be very happy with this outcome,"" Béland said.
Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.
""Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,"" Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.

Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the U.S. president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.
Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on goods from America's neighbor.

Here comes the bridal gown tariff
Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire.
Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term."

Helping a bride select her dream wedding dress can be an intimate process, says Christine Greenberg. You're physically in someone's space, helping them in and out of a dress, talking about childhood dreams and big-day emotions.
""Talking about money, talking about body image issues,"" says Greenberg, who's done this for 11 years as a co-owner of Urban Set Bride, a boutique in Richmond, Va.

But tariffs have now entered the bridal fitting room.
Couples are discovering that almost all U.S. wedding dresses are made abroad — even if they're designed in the States. And China is where most are stitched and embellished. According to the National Bridal Retailers Association, China accounts for a whopping 90% of the bridal gown market.
The Indicator from Planet Money
You told us how tariffs are affecting you
For a while, those Chinese-made wedding dresses faced a new tariff of 145% set by President Trump, which is now
temporarily cut
to 30% until July 9. The two countries
are still negotiating
, and brides are starting to pay up.
Jessica Kaplan from Boston arrived at her bridal appointment to a warning from store staff: all gowns now carry a tariff surcharge of 10% to 15% depending on the designer and their supply chain. Kaplan's A-line dress with a sweetheart neckline and a long tail ended up on the lower end, but still cost an extra $150.
""It wasn't detrimental,"" she says, ""but it was definitely a bummer on the day.""
Urban Set Bride co-owner Christine Greenberg says tariffs affect not only gowns, but many other imports needed at her Virginia store: veils, hairpieces, garment bags, hangers and even paper for the check-out register. ""It adds up very quickly,"" Greenberg says, ""and we're a small shop.""

Store owners struggle to budget
Unlike clothes bought off the rack, wedding gowns are usually special order. When someone buys a dress from Claire Landgraf's Finery Bridal Chic in Rochester, Minn., the order may take six or eight months.
""So what's the landscape of tariff charging going to look like in six to eight months? We don't know,"" she says.

Landgraf has already spent hundreds of dollars on tariffs for dresses that brides had ordered before Trump took office. What if the opposite happens now, and she charges brides a fee for a future tariff of an unclear amount?
Business
A small U.S. town grew a big company. Can it weather the tariff blizzard?
""I don't feel good as a business owner about saying, 'Hey, Miss Bride who bought a gown at the top of her budget at $2,000 that included that tariff fee, months from now your gown came in and all of a sudden the tariff charge is another $300,'"" Landgraf says. ""I can't do that to brides. So it's just really, really uncertain.""
It's not just gowns arriving from China, but also trims and crystals, veils and hair pieces, hangers and garment bags. Most designers, including the popular Grace Loves Lace and Revelry, have decided to simply
raise prices
across the board to cover new tariff costs. Some by as much as 30%. Many store owners have followed suit.
Landgraf, for now, is adding a surcharge that she can remove later if tariffs disappear — and budgeting for refunds.

Double the cost for Made in the USA
U.S. brides — outside of big cities — on average spend less than $2,000 on a wedding dress, Landgraf and Greenberg estimate. American-made dresses tend to start around twice that price.
And not only are there few people buying them, but there are very few people making them.
""Unlike other industries, these dresses cannot be made in the United States,"" the National Bridal Retailers Association wrote earlier this year in
a lobbying letter
to U.S. lawmakers, ""as there is zero labor pool of skilled craftsmen that can hand-bead gowns with as many as 200,000 sequins, beads, and crystals.""
One of Trump's arguments for tariffs is to jump-start
more American manufacturing
. But U.S. textile and garment-making prowess faded decades ago. It would take many years to train enough technicians in lace work or embroidery to dress legions of American brides.
Economy
Trump tariff revenue soars 78%. Who's paying them?
""My dad was in the Army for 24 years — I would love to purchase American-made wedding gowns,"" says Greenberg, the Virginia shopkeeper. ""But they don't really exist, certainly not at the price point that the average American consumer could purchase a wedding gown.""
And so, some of the most popular U.S. gown makers, including Utah-based Maggie Sottero and Tennessee-based Allure, have urged the federal government to exempt formalwear from tariffs, saying instead of bringing back jobs, tariffs would shutter businesses.

VENICE, Italy — Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice's central streets on Saturday to say ""No"" to billionaire Jeff Bezos, his bride and their
much-awaited wedding extravaganza
, which reached its third and final day amid celebrity-crowded parties and the outcries of tired residents.
On Friday, the world's fourth-richest man and his bride Lauren Sanchez Bezos tied the knot during a private ceremony with around 200 celebrity guests on the secluded island of San Giorgio.
The wedding, however, angered many Venetians, with some activists protesting it as an exploitation of the city by the billionaire Bezos, while ordinary residents suffer from overtourism, high housing costs and the constant threat of climate-induced flooding.

As the two newlyweds prepared for the final party Saturday evening, hundreds of Venetians and protesters from across Italy filled Venice's tiny streets with colorful banners reading ""Kisses Yes, Bezos No"" and ""No Bezos, no War."" Venice has around 50,000 residents.
The demonstration contrasted with the expensive wedding bonanza, seen by critics as an affront to the lagoon city's fragile environment and its citizens, overwhelmed by throngs of tourists.
""We are here to continue ruining the plans of these rich people, who accumulate money by exploiting many other people … while the conditions of this city remain precarious,"" said Martina Vergnano, one of the demonstrators.
The protest organizers claimed that their planned protest had forced the relocation of Saturday's party from a supposed initial location to a former medieval shipyard, the Arsenale.
Bezos donated 1 million euros ($1.17 million) each to three environmental research organizations working to preserve Venice, according to Corila, the Venetian environmental research association.
But many protesters blasted the move as a clear attempt to appease angry residents.
""We want a free Venice, which is finally dedicated to its citizens. … Those donations are just a misery and only aimed at clearing Bezos' conscience,"" said Flavio Cogo, a Venetian activist who joined Saturday's protest.

Details of the exclusive wedding ceremony Friday night were a closely guarded secret, until
Sánchez Bezos posted to Instagram a photo
of herself beaming in a white gown as she stood alongside a tuxedo-clad Bezos.
Athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders
converged to revel in extravagance that was as much a testament to the couple's love as to their extraordinary wealth.
The star-studded guest list included Oprah Winfrey and NFL great Tom Brady, along with Hollywood stars Leonardo Di Caprio and Orlando Bloom, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates and top socialites, including the Kardashian-Jenner clan.
Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner and their three children also joined the celebrations.
The bride and groom stayed at the Aman Venice hotel on the Grand Canal, where Bezos posed for photos and Sanchez Bezos blew kisses to the press.
""The planet is burning but don't worry, here's the list of the 27 dresses of Lauren Sánchez,"" read one protest slogan, a reference to the bride's reported wedding weekend wardrobe. It featured a mermaid-lined wedding gown by Dolce & Gabbana and other Dolce Vita-inspired looks by Italian designers, including Schiaparelli and Bottega Veneta.
The city administration has strongly defended the nuptials as in keeping with Venice's tradition as an open city that has welcomed popes, emperors and ordinary visitors alike for centuries."

Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.
Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands — the parent company of Duncan Hines — both said they would phase out synthetic dyes.

from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.
In April, Trump's Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry."

All of us in public broadcasting owe a thanks to Bill Moyers, who died this week at the age of 91. He was one of the signature figures, along with Big Bird and Susan Stamberg, who helped build public broadcasting in the United States.
Moyers started his career as a teenage cub reporter at a newspaper in Marshall, Texas. He went on to work as an intern for then-senator Lyndon Johnson. He became ordained as Baptist minister, and a few years later, in 1960, he joined Johnson on the campaign trail, eventually following him to the White House after the Kennedy assassination.

""I work for him despite his faults,"" he said once when he was Johnson's press secretary, ""and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies."" They had a falling out, reportedly over the war in Vietnam, and Moyers returned to journalism for the next 6 decades.
He won the most prestigious awards of our profession, some in bunches:  more than 30 Emmys, 11 Peabodys, two Columbia-Duponts, and many other honors for his PBS documentaries and interviews.
He interviewed newsmakers. But from the start of
Bill Moyers Journal
, to
NOW with Bill Moyers
, and to
Wide Angle
, he interviewed poets like Rita Dove, scholars like Joseph Campbell, and other writers, artists, religious leaders and historical figures like Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
He once asked Tutu how people who read the same Bible and prayed to the same God could wind up on opposite sides of grievously serious issues.
""We are human beings,"" Tutu said to him, ""who have been given, extraordinarily, by this God we worship the gift of freedom … God takes seriously the gift that God has given us. And we make choices. And the God, who is an omnipotent God, in many ways become impotent, because God has given us the gift to choose.""

In a media world which can overwhelm with breaking news, Bill Moyers asked questions that could be at once simple and probing in his Texas hill country tenor, steeped with a pastor's compassion, and reminded us to try to find out what can last in the human heart.
I remember what seemed almost an incidental remark he made years ago at a long news meeting which we both attended.
""Is this a story that reaches into people?,"" Bill Moyers asked.
We can honor his memory by asking ourselves that question as we go on with our work today."

Americans will be celebrating the Fourth of July with cookouts, parades and, of course, fireworks. But those fireworks may be more costly and harder to come by this year, as a result of President Trump's tariffs.

For Independence Day, NPR wants to know: What does freedom mean to you?
""I would anticipate that most people are going to get a little less bang for their bucks this year,"" says Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, an industry trade group.
That's because when it comes to the rockets, sparklers and fountains used to mark Independence Day, the U.S. is almost totally dependent on China — the country that invented fireworks more than a thousand years ago.
""China is the global supplier of fireworks,"" Heckman says. ""For the U.S. market, 99% of the backyard consumer fireworks are manufactured in China and 90% of the professional display fireworks are manufactured in China. So they are basically our sole source.""

How importers are having to deal with tariffs
Fireworks got a pass from the U.S.-China trade war the last time Trump was in office.  But not this year.  Like almost everything the U.S. buys from China, fireworks were hit with double- and even triple-digit tariffs this spring.
Some importers simply halted deliveries to avoid the import taxes.
""I think we will see some product shortages,"" Heckman says.  ""I would encourage customers to shop early for the best variety of product.""
The American Fireworks Company in Hudson, Ohio, had already stockpiled fireworks before the tariffs took effect. But it still made for a volatile season.
""We've changed pricing four different times,"" says John Sorgi, whose great-grandfather started the company in 1902.  ""At one point we were changing them pretty much every other week.""
John Sorgi (right) and his brother Roberto run the American Fireworks Company in Hudson, Ohio, which their great-grandfather started in 1902. They stage hundreds of shows each year but worry about the cost of tariffs on fireworks imported from China.

In addition to selling fireworks, Sorgi's company stages hundreds of professional shows each year.  As soon as this Fourth of July is over, he'll start looking ahead to 2026.
""This is go-time for us,"" Sorgi says. ""It's go time for the Fourth of July, but it's also go-time to get your orders in and get them moving for next year.""
2026 looms large for the fireworks industry
The fireworks industry has been eagerly anticipating 2026 for a decade.  Not only does the Fourth fall on a Saturday next year — which typically means a jump in backyard fireworks sales — but it's the climax of a year-long celebration of the nation's 250th birthday.
Sponsor Message
""We believe it's going to be a huge year,"" Heckman says.
But it's hard to plan for that big party without knowing what the tariffs will be. For now, Chinese fireworks are being taxed at 30%. But unless a trade deal is reached with China, that could rebound to April's level of 145%.
Sorgi says that would choke off a lot of imports and turn many of next year's Fourth of July displays into duds.
""I mean, your $50,000 show is going to look like a $30,000 show. Your $30,000 dollar show is going to look like a $15,000 to $18,000 show,"" Sorgi says. ""And then, when you get down to the smaller shows, which are a lot of the shows, those shows will probably just have to say, 'We're not doing it.'""

Trump says he's terminating trade talks with Canada, 'effective immediately'
Given the strict safety and environmental regulations in this country, Heckman says it's doubtful the U.S. is going to start making its own fireworks.  Members of her trade group are hoping that Trump's showmanship will outweigh his protectionist instincts, and allow for a tariff reprieve.
""We know he loves fireworks,"" Heckman says. ""And he's been talking about America's salute to the 250th from Day One.  And our industry wants to be a major player in that."""

At that same conference, speakers included two White House advisors, two sons of the US president, the son of the U.S. Commerce Secretary, and a Trump appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For a cryptocurrency built on independence from big government, this was a swerve.

Investors also shrugged off recent fighting in the Middle East, to send the S&P 500 index to a fresh peak of 6173.07, eclipsing the previous high reached back in February.
It's a remarkable turnaround for stocks, given that the index had fallen into bear market territory less than three months ago.
In April, the S&P dropped 20% from its February high, after the president announced

A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.
Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development,
according to the Solar Energy Industries Association
, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

Congressional Republicans are

that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.
Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.
""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term
Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development,
according to SEIA
.
This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.
Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.
Climate
U.S. electricity demand is set to explode. That will make it harder to cut climate pollution
But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018,
Trump approved tariffs
on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent
post on Truth Social
, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.
Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies,
according to the financial firm Lazard
. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.
Sponsor Message
If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""
Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which
announced it was building a Georgia solar factory
in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.
""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""
The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.
""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell
Pakistan
and
Latin America
and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer
Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.
However,
tariffs on their own weren't enough
to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.
But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.
""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout
The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.
Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to
a study this winter
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.
""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.
Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.
Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.
""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.
Reams' group has
called for lawmakers
to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""
Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.
""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""
With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.
""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese."""

Trump administration unveils a plan to modernize the air traffic control system
The current Trump administration is again focused on reforming air traffic control, following a recent spate of technical outages and staffing shortages as well as the January
midair collision
between an American Airlines regional jet and U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people.
But this time the goal is a multibillion-dollar investment in the Federal Aviation Administration — and talk of privatization seems to be on hold.
""To have a fight about privatization is just going to divide people,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said during
a press conference
last month. ""And what that'll actually do is make sure that we don't actually build a brand new air traffic control system.""
Sponsor Message
Aviation industry groups that once supported privatization are now uniting behind
Duffy's plan to modernize the system
by upgrading antiquated equipment and ""supercharging"" the hiring of new controllers. The proposal
has the backing
of the Modern Skies Coalition, a collection of groups that includes the trade association for the major airlines, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and others.
But the recent travel disruptions have also resurfaced the argument of some FAA critics that the best way to fix the nation's air traffic control system is to remove it from direct government control altogether.
How air traffic control is organized in Canada and beyond
Proponents of air traffic control privatization often point to Canada as an example. The U.S.'s northern neighbor
privatized its system
in 1996, when the government sold it to the non-profit NAV CANADA for $1.5 billion.

'No more floppy disks': Air traffic control overhaul faces some daunting obstacles
Canada's air travel system had been fraught with delays, and privatization made it easier to buy new technology that improved air travel without having to go through a slow-moving public procurement process, said McGill University aviation law professor Vincent Correia. ""The privatization aimed at finding a way to overcome those inefficiencies, most notably by having a more flexible approach when it comes to investments,"" he said.
The system's funding stream also changed. Canada went from paying for air traffic control largely through tax revenue to
charging customers a fee
based on the weight and distance of a flight.
Sponsor Message
According to Correia, privatizing air traffic control was the next move for an aviation sector that already had privately-held airplane manufacturers and commercial airlines. ""So basically the step that was taken by Canada was to say, well, air traffic control is providing a service to an industry that is already privatized or mostly privatized in many regions of the world,"" he said.
Other air traffic control systems that exist outside or partially outside the government include NATS in the United Kingdom, Airservices Australia, Airways New Zealand, DFS in Germany and Skyguide in Switzerland.
A
2017 report
by the Congressional Research Service said other countries' models don't appear to show ""conclusive evidence that any of these models is either superior or inferior to others or to existing government-run air traffic services, including FAA, with respect to productivity, cost-effectiveness, service quality, and safety and security.""

Still, there are private air traffic controllers working in the U.S. today. Through its
Contract Tower Program
, the FAA allows airports with limited air traffic to staff their towers with controllers employed by private companies. Just over half of all federal air traffic control towers are contract towers, mostly because they're at smaller general aviation airports.
The U.S. privatization debate has foundered
Opponents of privatization say it hasn't always worked out so well for the countries that have done it. They point, for example, to
a 2023 report
from the International Civil Aviation Organization that lowered Canada's flight safety grade and a recent
shortage of air traffic controllers
.

Disbelief, then fury: A Newark air traffic controller says they saw a crisis coming
Ed Bolen, CEO of the National Business Aviation Association, says a private system would be even harder to operate in the U.S., which has one of the largest and most complex airspaces in the world.
""When we look around at the performance in Australia, in New Zealand, in Europe, in the United Kingdom and in Canada, we see very small, not particularly complex operations compared to the U.S. and we see chronic delays,"" he said.
Another worry is that privatization could disadvantage smaller airports and pilots who don't produce the same economic impact as large airlines, says Jim Coon, senior vice president of the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
.

""That would be very detrimental to many small communities around the country that rely on these small airports for medical issues, for disaster relief, for businesses, because those airports don't bring in the amount of revenue that the large airports that the airlines use,"" he said.

The
Covid-19 outbreak
exposed another issue with privatization. Because some countries' systems were funded by user fees, air traffic control operators ran into trouble when air travel dramatically decreased due to the pandemic.
But Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the libertarian think tank Reason Foundation, says the U.S. air traffic control system could be improved by turning it into what he calls a public utility. (The
Clinton administration suggested
transforming U.S. air traffic control into a quasi-government corporation in 1994.)

Currently, Poole says, travelers and airlines pay taxes that go to the U.S. Treasury, and that money then has to be appropriated by Congress to the FAA. In a public utility model, ""the revenues would go directly to the air traffic corporation, whether it's a nonprofit or a government corporation,"" he said.
National
How archaic tech, staff shortages and construction made a meltdown at Newark Airport
The public utility could issue bonds to fund large projects — which the FAA can't do — and streamline its procurement process, Poole added.
He also said the FAA, in its role as a safety regulator, would be more empowered to enforce safety infractions if air traffic controllers were not FAA employees. ""So you have a better protection for aviation safety in this vital part of the system — air traffic control — which today in the United States unfortunately is embedded in the safety regulator and not at arm's length from the safety regulator,"" he said.
U.S. privatization likely not on the horizon
Former Republican Rep. Bill Shuster, who proposed legislation in Congress privatizing air traffic control in 2017, was advocating for the idea as recently as November,
AIN
reported
. In December, the libertarian Cato Institute
published an article
urging Trump to privatize the system.
Sponsor Message
But within the aviation industry, calls to privatize air traffic control have largely faded.
Even the major airlines, once vocal supporters of privatization, have cooled on it. The trade group Airlines for America, which
backed
Trump's 2017 privatization effort,
co-signed a letter
with other aviation groups in February opposing privatization, saying it would be a ""distraction"" from the planned upgrades to the air traffic control system.
Coon, with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, says the aviation industry is coalescing behind the Trump administration's plan to modernize the national air traffic control system, largely leaving privatization behind for now.
""It's been discussed for decades. There's not consensus there,"" he said. ""But there is consensus now to modernize our system, and that's what we want to do."""

The U.S. is terminating all trade talks with Canada as Canada proceeds with a digital services tax that would apply to several major U.S. tech companies, the president said in a Friday social media post.

U.S. vs. China: Inside a great power rivalry
Trump says a U.S.-China trade deal is 'done'
The news that the U.S. is ending trade talks with Canada comes after 24 hours of various tariff updates from the White House, including the announcement of a new agreement with China and an acknowledgement that a July 8 tariff deadline may be pushed back.
The flurry of news is the latest in several chaotic months of back-and-forth tariff announcements followed by subsequent adjustments. Imposing higher tariffs on goods from other countries was a major campaign promise of Trump's, which he framed as an effort to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and raise revenue. However, those goals conflict with each other, and tariffs also often burden consumers with higher prices.
The president's Canada post refers to a digital services tax set to go into effect on June 30. That measure would tax multinational tech companies for revenue collected — for example from advertising — from providing services to Canadian users. Several European countries have imposed similar taxes.
Earlier this month, Canada's Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne
said the country would move forward
with the tax, despite U.S. opposition. The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's announcement Friday.
Planet Money
The U.S.-China trade war, according to game theory
At the G7 summit in Canada last week, Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had said they wanted to negotiate a tariff deal in the next 30 days. That came after months of tension between the two countries, kicked off when Trump on his first day in office announced that he wanted to put 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. Months of retaliations and animosity followed, including Trump repeatedly suggesting that Canada become the 51st state.
The post about Canada came hours after Trump told reporters that a self-imposed July 9 deadline for establishing tariff levels for most countries might be delayed.
Sponsor Message
""We can do whatever we want. We can extend it, we can make it shorter. I'd like to make it shorter,"" he said of the deadline. ""I'd like to just send letters out to everybody – 'Congratulations. You're paying 25 percent.' ""
That deadline applies to tariffs on goods from nearly every country, which Trump announced on April 2, with some of those tariffs exceeding 40%. Days later, he announced a 90-day ""pause,"" bringing the tariffs down to 10%.
That ""pause"" is set to end on July 9, raising questions about what happens after that. Trump said he would reach longer-term individual tariff deals with countries during the 90-day period, but the only deal announced so far has been with the UK, signed last week at the G7 summit.
On Thursday, Trump also announced a trade agreement with China, which officials later said was an agreement on a framework for a deal and not a finalized agreement on tariffs and other trade issues like rare earth minerals.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed Thursday evening on Bloomberg TV that China would ""deliver rare earths to us."" He added that subsequently, ""we'll take down our countermeasures.""
In a statement, China's Ministry of Commerce also acknowledged that ""further details of the framework"" have been established.
""China will, in accordance with the law, review and approve eligible export applications for controlled items,"" they wrote. ""In turn, the United States will lift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.""
The base tariffs on Chinese goods have the potential to be globally destabilizing, and at one point reached 145%.
At a meeting in Geneva last month, U.S. and Chinese officials announced they had reached a temporary deal that would bring U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 30%, with an Aug. 12 deadline to reach a more permanent agreement.
The high tariffs China and the U.S. imposed on each other's goods rattled markets as American consumers faced higher prices on a wide array of products, like car seats and clothing, while American farmers feared Chinese consumers would buy fewer of their now more expensive food exports."

William J. Smith/AP
Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television's most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.
Moyers died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during
Lyndon B. Johnson's administration
. Moyers' son William said his father died at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York after a ""long illness.""
Moyers' career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson's press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for ""The CBS Evening News"" and chief correspondent for ""CBS Reports.""
Sponsor Message
But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV's most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.
Author Interviews
Bill Moyers Remembers Favorite 'Journal' Interviews
In 1988, Moyers produced ""The Secret Government"" about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,"" a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.
His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men's Movement, and his 1993 series ""Healing and the Mind"" had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.
In a medium that supposedly abhors ""talking heads"" — shots of subject and interviewer talking — Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: ""The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.""
(Softly) speaking truth to power
Demonstrating what someone called ""a soft, probing style"" in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.
Sponsor Message
From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn't necessarily deny.
""I'm an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people's ideas,"" he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a ""citizen journalist"" operating independently, outside the establishment.
Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw ""the conversation of democracy open to all comers,"" he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.
""I think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,"" he said another time, ""but they've chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.""
Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for
career excellence in broadcast journalism
. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.
From sports to sports writing
Born in Hugo, Okla., on June 5, 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.
""I wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,"" he recalled.
He worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the ""y"" from his name.
Sponsor Message
He graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master's in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry ""was a wrong number.""
His relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote the then-senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson's employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.
On the day
John F. Kennedy was assassinated
in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.

Moyers' stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.
Of his departure from the White House, he wrote later, ""We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.""
He conceded that he may have been ""too zealous in my defense of our policies"" and said he regretted criticizing journalists such as Pulitzer Prize-winner
Peter Arnett
, then a special correspondent with the AP, and CBS's
Morley Safer
for their war coverage.
A long run on television
In 1967, Moyers became publisher of Long Island-based Newsday and concentrated on adding news analyses, investigative pieces and lively features. Within three years, the suburban daily had won two Pulitzers. He left the paper in 1970 after the ownership changed. That summer, he traveled 13,000 miles around the country and wrote a best-selling account of his odyssey: ""Listening to America: a Traveler Rediscovers His Country.""
Sponsor Message
His next venture was in public television and he won critical acclaim for
""Bill Moyers Journal,""
a series in which interviews ranged from Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, to poet Maya Angelou. He was chief correspondent of ""CBS Reports"" from 1976 to 1978, went back to PBS for three years, and then was senior news analyst for CBS from 1981 to 1986.
When CBS cut back on documentaries, he returned to PBS for much less money. ""If you have a skill that you can fold with your tent and go wherever you feel you have to go, you can follow your heart's desire,"" he once said.

His projects in the 21st century included ""Now,"" a weekly PBS public affairs program; a new edition of ""Bill Moyers Journal"" and a podcast covering racism, voting rights and the rise of Donald Trump, among other subjects.
Moyers married Judith Davidson, a college classmate, in 1954, and they raised three children, among them the author Suzanne Moyers and author-TV producer William Cope Moyers. Judith eventually became her husband's partner, creative collaborator and president of their production company."

Anthropic's Claude said it couldn't authenticate the content one way or the other.

How AI-generated memes are changing the 2024 election
Another concern for Farid is AI's ability to significantly muddy perceptions of current events. He points to an example from the recent protests against President Trump's immigration raids: California Gov. Gavin Newsom shared an image of activated
National Guard members sleeping
on the floor in Los Angeles. Newsom's
post criticized
Trump's leadership, saying, ""You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep."" Farid said internet users began to question the photo's authenticity, with some saying it was AI generated. Others submitted it
to ChatGPT
and were told the image was fake.
""And suddenly the internet went crazy: 'Governor Newsom caught sharing a fake image,'"" said Farid, whose team was able to authenticate the photo. ""So now, not only are people getting unreliable information from ChatGPT, they're putting in images that don't fit their narrative, don't fit the story that they want to tell, and then ChatGPT says, 'Ah, it's fake.' And now we're off to the races.""
As Farid warns often, these added layers of uncertainty seem certain to play out in dangerous ways. ""When the real video of human rights violations comes out, or a bombing, or somebody saying something inappropriate, who's going to believe it anymore?"" he said. ""If I say, '1 plus 1 is 2,' and you say, 'No, it's not. It's applesauce' — because that's the tenor of the conversation these days — I don't know where we are.""

AI-generated images have become a new form of propaganda this election season
Brooking said people don't have to believe visual content is authentic to enjoy sharing it. Humor, for example, attracts plenty of user engagement. He sees AI-generated content following a pattern similar to what researchers have seen with political satire, such as when headlines from
The Onion
, a satirical newspaper, have gone viral.
""[Internet users] were signaling a certain affinity or set of views by sharing it,"" said Brooking. ""It was expressing an idea they already had.""
Generative AI's creative abilities are ripe for use in propaganda of all kinds, according to Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor who studies how states like China, Iran and Russia use digital tools for propaganda.
""There's a very famous campaign where the Russians planted a story in an Indian newspaper back in the '80s,"" said Linvill. The KGB sought to spread the false narrative that the Pentagon was responsible for creating the AIDS virus, so ""[the KGB] planted this story in a newspaper that they founded, and then used that original story to then layer the story through a purposeful narrative laundering campaign in other outlets over time. But it took years for this story to get out.""
As technology has improved, influence campaigns have sped up. ""They're engaging in the same process in days and even hours today,"" Linvill said.
Linvill's

President Trump reported income of more than $630 million last year, including $57 million from cryptocurrency sales and more than $8 million licensing his name for products like watches, guitars and
Bibles
.
According to a
234-page financial disclosure
released earlier this month on June 13, the billionaire president has assets of more than $1.6 billion across his business empire that includes real estate, hotels and golf courses, plus investment accounts and newer Trump-branded ventures touted on the campaign trail.
About three quarters of the income reported is revenue from Trump hotels and golf courses, like his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Then there's millions in merchandise and retail sales, plus licensing deals, like $2.8 million for ""Trump Watches,"" $2.5 million for
Trump Sneakers
and Perfumes and more than $1.3 million from the ""God Bless the USA Bible,"" which features the chorus of Lee Greenwood's eponymous song, plus the Constitution, Declaration of Independence and Pledge of Allegiance.

Trump Mobile, the latest venture from the president, launches
That's reflected in the disclosure of more than $57 million in income from selling cryptocurrency tokens through the World Liberty Financial crypto venture founded last year – and does not account for the estimated hundreds of millions of dollars earned this year through the launch of a
Trump ""memecoin.""
Democrats and ethics experts have questioned the president's involvement in crypto at a time when Congress is working on legislation to regulate the burgeoning industry. The White House has repeatedly pointed out the president's assets are in a revocable trust and said the president follows all ethics laws.
Last month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was ""absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency.""
Trump's financial disclosure shows a diverse stream of income sources, ranging from a few hundred dollars in residual checks from appearances in movies and TV shows like The Little Rascals and Fresh Prince of Bel Air to a few million dollars from selling a Cessna airplane last March.

Launched on the 10-year anniversary of his presidential campaign announcement, it's another example of Trump's brand on full display. The phone plan will reportedly offer service through the three major cell providers, and its ""The 47 plan"" will be available for $47.45 – a nod to Trump being the 47th and 45th president.

Republicans are facing a conundrum.
They want to cut taxes with their ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" But the tax cuts they want will explode the federal debt. So they've been looking for spending cuts. One big area where they want to slash: Medicaid, which provides
over 75 million Americans
— including low-income families, seniors and disabled people — with health insurance.
The conundrum: Medicaid is
widely popular
, including among many Republican voters in their now more working-class coalition forged by President Trump.
So how can they cut Medicaid while sheltering themselves from the political fallout of cutting Medicaid?
Sponsor Message
Their answer: work requirements. Draft versions of the bill have
included provisions
that would force millions of working-age, able-bodied adults to work to receive Medicaid — and every six months show the government proof they work to remain on the program.
It's sort of a brilliant answer politically because, on the face of it, the idea that able-bodied adults should have to work to receive government benefits is
widely popular
. Sure, progressives argue that health care should be a right available to all. But conservatives argue
these
requirements are necessary to fight ""waste, fraud, and abuse."" And, more broadly, that work requirements incentivize people to work and prevent able-bodied, working-age people from freeloading off of hard-working Americans. Some argue that work requirements may even help this nonworking population, pushing them to find gainful employment and achieve greater prosperity for themselves or their families. There is some
peer-reviewed economic evidence
that suggests kicking people off of government health insurance programs can encourage them to work more.
"" I certainly think it's reasonable to impose work requirements for Medicaid,"" says Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Corinth says he supports Medicaid and also the many work-requirement exemptions found in the One Big Beautiful Bill, including for disabled people, children and the elderly. As for those who can work, he suggests, they should work, and he thinks ""there is a pretty good chance you'll see real employment gains"" if work requirements get implemented. This nudge to work, he says, could ultimately prove to be beneficial for many in this population.
Sponsor Message
However, a
growing amount
of
evidence
suggests that adding work and other eligibility requirements to social programs fails to do much to actually encourage work. The majority of people who use these programs
already work
. Or, if they don't work, it's often because they're disabled or elderly or children or have issues that adding work requirements to a government program won't usually help with.
One of the biggest sources of cost savings from work requirements may not come from eliminating benefits for those who aren't working. Instead, studies suggest that, in practice, work and other eligibility requirements achieve a lot of savings in a sort of sneaky way. It's that the eligibility requirements themselves create a bureaucratic rigmarole that many
who are eligible
for benefits struggle to navigate. A
ton of them
get lost in the maze of paperwork and get kicked off the program. Call it the paperwork trap (h/t to
Planet Money
's Erika Beras for helping coin this term).
In economics, this sort of red tape that makes it harder for people to do or get something is known as ""administrative burdens"" or ""ordeals"" (although the behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
offer
a more fun name for it: ""sludge"").
A back door for cutting the social safety net?
Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy, is a leading scholar of administrative burdens.
"" Bureaucracies can often generate administrative burdens inadvertently,"" Moynihan says. ""But they can also be deliberately created by policymakers who want to reduce the cost of programs by making it more difficult for people to access them.""
The federal government has a wide variety of social programs that vary in difficulty to prove eligibility and obtain benefits. Moynihan points to Social Security as a program that's more easily accessible, so a much higher percentage of people eligible for it actually use it. Almost all American seniors are eligible for Social Security and the government makes it almost automatic to receive benefits, which is why
nearly 100%
of those eligible get it. On the other end of the spectrum are programs like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), an old-school welfare program that was reformed under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Programs like these have stricter eligibility requirements, and they're more difficult to sign up for because people have to prove their eligibility (like, for example, proving how much they make). That results in these programs having a much lower participation rate.
Sponsor Message
There's a growing mountain of evidence on the effects of administrative burdens. (For a good summary of this literature, check out
this recent essay
in the
Journal of Economic Perspectives
from Moynihan and his co-author Pamela Herd).
As an example, Moynihan points to what happened in Arkansas after it became the first state to adopt work requirements for Medicaid in 2018. A
2019 study
published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
found that these work requirements failed to boost employment rates much or at all within the first year after they were implemented. Meanwhile, the authors found that thousands of Arkansans who did work or who qualified for exemptions — because, for example, they were disabled or elderly — were kicked off the program.
Moynihan says it's
a similar story
with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), more commonly known as food stamps. He says SNAP already has work requirements (which Republicans want to beef up in the One Big Beautiful Bill), and
evidence shows
that
existing requirements
haven't done much to encourage work. They mostly just make it harder for people to get food assistance. In fact, evidence suggests that SNAP work requirements have the biggest effect on those least able to work,
according to Yale scholars Chima Ndumele and Jacob Wallace
.
""The largest effect of work requirements isn't actually to incentivize people to work,"" Moynihan says. ""The largest effect is to get people who are working and put them in a situation where they're caught in this administrative trap that they simply can't get around. And so they tend to lose benefits even though they are actually fulfilling the requirements. It's the paperwork that catches them.""
If we humans were the perfectly rational creatures of old-school economic theory, these types of administrative burdens wouldn't do much to trip us up. Back in the early 1980s, economists
theorized
these ""ordeals,"" as they called them, could even be beneficial, serving as an efficient way to target benefits to those who want or need them the most.
Sponsor Message
However, a lot of newer research, especially in behavioral economics, points to how our cognitive quirks and limitations may prevent us from doing what's in our best interests. For example, we may procrastinate and fail to fill out the necessary paperwork in time. We may suffer from ""present bias,"" valuing our time now more than our well-being later. We may not even know we have to fill out forms to get benefits or even about these benefits at all.
Studies
suggest
that
low-income
populations have
a harder time
dealing with these administrative burdens. They are often living paycheck to paycheck. Sometimes they're homeless. Sometimes they have disabilities or
chronic diseases
. They may have inflexible work schedules or not have a computer. They may have life stresses and struggles that
lower their mental bandwidth
, and it's hard for them to dedicate the time and effort to satisfy requirements even though they meet the criteria for assistance.
Kevin Corinth acknowledges that red tape can cause problems and force some legitimate beneficiaries to fall through the cracks. But, he says, the reality is ""work requirements are popular, especially among Republicans, but even among many Democrats."" And enforcing those requirements necessarily entails some red tape, as much as he hates it.
Draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill have left some discretion to the states when it comes to setting work requirements and how Medicaid recipients have to prove their compliance with them. Corinth argues that states should invest time and effort into ""making it as easy as possible to demonstrate compliance, so people can focus on complying as opposed to the actual paperwork part of it."" He suggests administrative burdens can be minimized and not be extremely onerous.
Moynihan, however, suggests that administrative burdens might be the point. He suggests that politicians have learned to use administrative burdens as a sneaky way to cut popular social programs. It gives them more political cover. They can claim that they're not really cutting these programs. They're just making sure the right, deserving people get them. But, in effect, they swamp potential beneficiaries with paperwork and other hassles and make it more difficult to get benefits. Some significant percentage gets caught in the spider web of paperwork and, boom, the government reduces how much it spends under the program.
Sponsor Message
That's basically what Moynihan sees in the draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill. He says it could prove to be the largest cut to Medicaid we've ever seen — even though many Republicans are claiming that they're not really cutting it, just ""reforming"" it (although there have been
some Freudian slips
when making that claim). The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan budget agency, estimates that the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill would cut Medicaid spending by
almost $800 billion
over 10 years. And, Moynihan argues, they're ""doing it through the backdoor mechanism of simply making it harder for people to maintain coverage through these administrative requirements."""

The Trump administration official running the parent agency of the Voice of America defended her efforts to shut it down at a hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, at one point insisting — without evidence — that the Chinese Communist Party has more influence than American values over the federally funded network's news coverage.
""Hopefully, we can root out the Russian, Chinese, Iranian propaganda that has been prevalent on our airwaves at VOA, and we're going to work to do that,"" U.S. Agency for Global Media senior adviser, Kari Lake, told members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""Some say it's the Voice of anti-America.""
Sponsor Message
Asked about foreign journalists working for the Voice of America and other U.S-funded networks who face peril — several reporters are
currently imprisoned by authoritarian regimes
— Lake suggested that was a problem for the networks, not the federal government.
""The safety and security of American journalists is important ... and I don't think they've done enough to protect them,"" Lake said. ""The question is: Why aren't we hiring more Americans?""
""That's sort of like blaming the group that's advocating for these people,"" Massachusetts Democrat Bill Keating shot back. ""What are they doing? I'll tell you what they're doing - they've simply asked for a meeting with you to discuss this issue!""
Network chiefs have said they have been unable to get Lake to meet with them to hear out their concerns. Lake oversees their federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, for President Trump, and she has served as an outspoken advocate for his positions on a series of wide-ranging issues.
Foreign journalists are typically hired because they know other languages and cultures in addition to having skills as broadcasters and reporters, according to public accounts from past Voice of America officials who have served under presidents of both parties. The U.S. Agency for Global Media must try to hire U.S. journalists with such knowledge first, but it often proves hard to do so, they say.

Michael Abramowitz, currently on indefinite leave as Voice of America's director, called her claims of Chinese influence ""ludicrous"" and unfounded. He said the Chinese authorities hate Voice of America and have no influence over the network.
""VOA has reported extensively and critically — across multiple languages — on the [Chinese government's] activities both within China and around the world,"" Abramowitz said in a statement shared with NPR. ""Congress should ask Ms. Lake to provide proof for the mystifying allegations that were made at the hearings."" Abramowitz is among the agency staffers currently
suing Lake and the agency
.
Many in the foreign policy establishment and journalism hail Voice of America's importance, and not simply for broadcasting to countries that were ruled by the Nazis or part of the Soviet Union. In the current moment, Lake has sought alternately to dismantle it or strip it of editorial independence enshrined in law. She put nearly the entire Voice of America workforce on leave earlier this spring, firing hundreds of contractors. On Friday, she
sent termination notices
to 85% of the permanent employees.
Lake also sought to revoke Congressionally mandated grants to the other federally funded networks, which include the nonprofits Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. After adverse rulings in the courts, she has since agreed to comply with delivering the promised funds, but they have been notably slow in coming.
Lake has relished conflict over the matter and finds herself at the center of the fray twice this week: with the Congressional hearing Wednesday on the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and in court hearings over her leadership of it.
Suspicions of foreign workers
The twin proceedings represent the polar extremes of official Washington's take on the Voice of America. At Wednesday's House hearing, Lake broadly accused the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the Voice of America of security so lax that they had been infiltrated by foreign spies.
Sponsor Message
The hearing, arranged by Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, a Trump ally, took inspiration from claims that improper vetting caused security breaches in the hiring of foreign journalists to report for the networks funded by the agency.
Lake claimed that foreigners were abusing a visa system set up to allow journalists from abroad to work at the Voice of America's foreign-language news services for several years. She also slammed the firewall enshrined in U.S. law that protects the newsroom from direct editorial influence or pressure by federal lawmakers.
Voice of America staffers — including some of those who are currently suing her — rebutted some of her claims even before the hearing started and continued to do so during it. For example, security concerns had been identified under President Barack Obama and during Trump's first term; remedies were taken under President Joe Biden.
Lake's arguments echoed those of Trump's pick five years ago as U.S Agency for Global Media chief, Michael Pack, who cited the same security concerns. Pack tried to fire holders of the same specialized J-1 visas in 2020, but internal documents released subsequently showed they were driven by an America First outlook, rather than any foreign infiltration.
""USAGM must prioritize employment for American citizens,"" Pack's chief of staff
wrote at the time
. ""When employers trade American jobs for temporary foreign labor, it reduces opportunities for U.S. workers.""
An inspector general's report
exonerated six agency executives
suspended by Pack in 2020 over related allegations of security lapses.
At the hearing, lawmakers split along fairly conventional party lines: no Republicans criticized Trump's executive order that called for the agency and the networks it funds to be boiled down only to the specific operations that Congress explicitly specified, such as the Persian language service. Many GOP lawmakers also affirmed Lake's claims of waste and liberal bias.
Sponsor Message
Even so, several Democrats seemed open to reconsidering whether the U.S. Agency for Global Media was the best federal parent for the networks; Lake has advocated it be eliminated and that any surviving services be put under the State Department. And Democrats invited Lake to consult further with Congress over which technologies would be best to distribute the services in the age of livestreaming.
No Democrats, however, signed onto her call to replace the networks' hundreds of journalists with a reliance on posts on Elon Musk's social media platform X or podcasts like that of Joe Rogan, as Lake suggested.
Media
Kari Lake says OAN's far-right coverage will fuel Voice of America
Several Republicans on the committee joined Democrats in highlighting the importance of Voice of America's work in China, Iran, Myanmar, Armenia and elsewhere. And Democrats dressed down Lake for taking an absolutist approach in eviscerating the networks without careful study first. Lake endorsed Trump's push to have the agency eliminated in the next fiscal year's budget.
Also on Wednesday, Senate appropriators held a
hearing about broader clawbacks
of funds allocated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, still the senior Republican senator from Kentucky, affirmed the importance of the sort of American ""soft power"" that the networks were established to promote, although he did not refer to them by name. Soft power, he said, was much less expensive than going to war.
Indeed, after the Israeli and U.S. bombing raids on Iran, Lake called some employees of Voice of America's Persian and Dari-language networks back to work, albeit without rescinding termination notices. Two Voice of America staffers say that Iranian relatives of some Persian-language journalists have been threatened by authorities. NPR agreed to grant them anonymity given the fear of retribution.
Judge weighs lawsuits over Lake's moves
On Monday, U.S. Senior District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered federal lawyers for the agency and Lake to explain by Friday how it is complying with his order to keep Voice of America alive.
Sponsor Message
""What would be the purpose of Voice of America if there was no voice?"" Lamberth asked,
according to the Associated Press
. The larger case is caught up in the appellate courts, where Lake and the government
won a reprieve
from much of his order that she freeze her actions to dismantle the services.
World
Trump tried to shutter Radio Free Europe. The EU threw it a lifeline
Lake said she had been paying the nonprofit networks in a timely way — an assertion they dispute. The Middle East Broadcasting Networks have all but shut down; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia have engaged in mass furloughs as they seek to survive.
While Voice of America officials acknowledge some missteps over time, as occurs at all news outlets, it has historically sought to promote American democratic values by offering coverage of pluralistic political debate inside the U.S., featuring criticism of U.S. government policy along with official statements.
In a series of posts, former Voice of America acting director Elez Biberaj
wrote
that Lake's statements ""reflect a sweeping, ideologically driven attempt to dismantle the Voice of America based on broad, unsubstantiated claims.""
""This decision doesn't just gut a vital institution,"" Biberaj, a 43-year-veteran of the service before his retirement ,  also
wrote
. ""It is profoundly harmful to our national interests, undermines key foreign policy objectives, weakens our credibility abroad, and threatens the mission that VOA has pursued for decades: to report the truth, tell America's compelling story to the world, and promote its democratic values."""

Trump administration pauses $3 billion marked for electric vehicle charging stations
Billions of dollars are at stake, which Congress had allocated to the states in order to install high-speed chargers along highway corridors. The Department of Transportation announced a temporary pause in distributing those funds in February, saying that new guidance for applying for the funding would be published this spring. No new guidance has been published, and the funds remain paused.
The court order is a preliminary injunction, not a final decision in the case itself. The judge also added a seven-day pause before it goes into effect, to allow the administration time to appeal the decision. After seven days, if no appeal has been filed, the Department of Transportation would have to stop withholding funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and distribute them to the 14 states.
Sponsor Message
While the legal battle is ongoing, the judge's ruling is an early win for the states and a setback for the Trump administration. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who is co-leading the suit, said in a statement he was pleased with the order, while the Sierra Club called it ""only a first step"" toward the full restoration of the funds.
In a statement emailed to NPR, the Department of Transportation wrote: ""Another day, another liberal judicial activist making nonsensical rulings from the bench because they hate President Trump. The Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster and failed miserably to deliver EV chargers. While we [assess] our legal options, the order does not stop our ongoing work to reform the program, so it actually works for the American people, which continues apace.""
A 180-degree policy turn on EV chargers
The Biden administration advanced a multi-pronged effort to promote electric vehicles in the United States, including allocating billions of dollars to build chargers to alleviate drivers' ""
range anxiety
"" and make road trips in an EV more convenient.
But the $5 billion from the NEVI program was slow to roll out. States had to make detailed plans for how they would spend the money and get approval from the federal government before charger sites could be selected, permitting acquired, contractors lined up and construction begun.

That meant that much of the money — 84% of it, according to the current Department of Transportation — had not yet been spent when President Trump took office. Trump brought with him a new agenda,
prioritizing fossil fuels
and
combustion engines
and
dismantling EV incentives as well as regulations
.
Within a few weeks, the Department of Transportation announced that the NEVI program was being put on pause, and no new money from that pool of cash would be made available to states until guidance had been rewritten.

Seventeen attorneys general joined the suit, alleging that the freeze on funds disrupted projects that were underway — and in some cases already under construction — and that the disruptions will get worse if the pause continues. (Only 14 of those states were granted relief in the injunction; the judge said two states and the District of Columbia did not provide the necessary evidence.)
Furthermore, the states alleged, delaying the rollout of those chargers hampered the states' ability to meet their targets for cutting transportation-related carbon emissions, as part of their efforts to slow the catastrophic effects of climate change.
A challenge to the separation of powers
In her ruling, Judge Tana Lin of the Western District of Washington wrote that although these issues of EV charging and policy preferences ""lurk in the background of this case, the bedrock doctrines of separation of powers and agency accountability, as enshrined in Constitution and statute, are indifferent to subject matter and blind to personality.""
That is to say, this is about much more than just chargers.

Politics
Political scientists alarmed by Trump's disregard for checks on the executive branch
Crucially, the money Congress allocated to the NEVI program is not grant money that has to be competed for and won, which would give the executive branch discretion over whether it's awarded or not. Instead, it's what's called ""formula funding,"" which means that Congress allocated it to states based on a calculation. Each state gets a certain percentage of the total pool, as long as they follow the required steps, including making detailed plans for where they'd put chargers and how.
The states did follow those steps, and their plans were approved under the Biden administration. So, they say in their suit, they had made agreements and contracts based on the expectation that they'd get the money allocated to them — expectations which have been disrupted. As Lin wrote, the freeze ""has pulled the rug out from under them.""

Like
several other cases
currently
working through the courts
, the dispute centers on the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Congress has the power of the purse, and dictates spending; the executive branch administers that spending. The Trump administration has tested the limits of this system by
refusing to spend money that Congress had previously allocated.

The NEVI funds were allocated to states in the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021, which remains in place. The Department of Transportation is free to update its guidance about how that program is administered moving forward, Lin wrote, but that does not require suspending the distribution of money — and should not involve canceling plans that were already approved.

Immediately after Israel attacked Iran earlier this month, crude oil prices spiked up — exactly like you'd expect with a war that threatens oil supplies.
The price increase was substantial: 7% within a few hours. But at the same time, it wasn't the kind of meteoric rise that would signal that the world could be headed for an
oil crisis
. Prices hit $80 per barrel at their peak this month. That's still lower than they were in January.
""We saw a lot of people … saying, 'Why isn't crude reacting more?'"" says Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. After all, Iran is one of the world's 10 biggest oil producers, and it has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz and restrict even more oil from flowing.

Middle East conflict
After lashing out at Israel and Iran, Trump says the 'ceasefire is in effect'
Oil prices continued to go up and down as the conflict extended and rose again over the weekend after the U.S. got involved. But then, as Iran did not block the strait or otherwise interfere in the oil trade, prices started to drop — and swiftly. Even before a
ceasefire
was announced, prices trended down.
Now, crude oil prices are actually
lower
than they were before Israel attacked.
""The market has shown that it's been very resilient to some of the geopolitical shocks that historically would have sent prices skyrocketing,"" says Angie Gildea, U.S. energy lead for the accounting giant KPMG. ""We didn't see that much with Russia-Ukraine, and we haven't seen that with Israel-Hamas. And we're certainly not seeing that in this case.""
Here are five reasons why the Iran conflict hasn't caused a crisis.
Iran has not targeted oil supplies
The big concern for the oil market was the possibility that Iran would close the
Strait of Hormuz
, through which about 20% of the world's oil supply passes, or otherwise stop oil from flowing to markets.
Such a disruption to oil supplies would be a major development. Despite efforts to pivot to other sources of energy to fight climate change, the global economy runs on oil — more than 100 million barrels per day, and increasing. A sudden drop in supply would send prices up, with ripple effects worldwide.
Middle East conflict
Why is China so concerned about Israel-Iran tensions?
But so far, Iran has declined to block the Strait of Hormuz, and analysts think the prospect is unlikely at this point — in part because of the intense economic pain it would cause Iran.
Oil traders have learned to be skeptical of spikes
Even in the absence of any actual hit to supply, there was a time when just the possibility of it might have pushed prices up to eye-watering levels — oil markets often respond to fear as much as to reality. But Babin says traders have learned to be cautious, based on what happened with oil prices after Hamas attacked Israel, or when Israel attacked Iran last year, or at other times when tensions have mounted.
Sponsor Message
""Throughout all the other geopolitical events that have happened over the last several years, we get these spikes and then supply is not impacted and they revert very quickly,"" she says.
It's like the story of the boy who cried wolf: Markets keep signaling there's a reason to panic, but as the threat fails to materialize again and again, the response is diminishing.
Autumn is approaching (in the world of oil)
The summer solstice may have just passed, but oil contracts work on a different calendar.
""The buyers of crude oil are now buying for August and beyond,"" explains Susan Bell, senior vice president of commodities analysis at Rystad Energy. ""And that starts to move them into the lower demand season … where prices should actually start softening.""
Oil demand tends to go down when it's autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. That's also taken some pressure off.
The world just has too much oil
Oil analysts call it ""the fundamentals"" of the oil market: supply and demand, how much of the stuff the world needs and how much it makes. Lately, demand has been growing slowly, thanks in part to an underwhelming Chinese economy. Supply, though, has been booming, in part because OPEC and its allies
keep putting more barrels on the market.
Business
Why oil prices are falling and what it means for the economy
The market is oversupplied. That pushes prices down — and it means there's less panicking about something that could potentially cut into supplies.
The U.S. is the world's dominant oil producer
Last, but not least, the geopolitics of oil have been transformed over the last decade. The shale revolution — when newer technology like fracking unlocked more oil from U.S. oil fields — lessened the world's dependence on crude from the Middle East.
Today, the U.S. is the world's largest producer of oil, as well as the largest consumer.
Sponsor Message
""The impact on the oil market is profound,"" says Jim Burkhard, who heads crude oil market research for S&P Global. ""It is among the most important factors why the response in the oil market to geopolitical conflict in the Middle East is limited and often disappears once the fear of a potential disruption dies down.""
It's not just that the U.S. produces a lot of oil; it's also that the U.S. can produce a lot
more
shale oil quickly, allowing a rapid response if there
was
a major supply disruption that led to a prolonged price hike.
The power of U.S. production was what President Trump alluded to this week when he repeated his call for producers to ""drill, baby, drill."" But in the U.S., where companies produce oil, not the government, the scale of production isn't dictated by politicians, but by the market.
And that market, again, is oversupplied. Burkhard is skeptical that any U.S. boom is coming.
""We think — we've been saying for the last few months — U.S. production is going to decline,"" he says.
The market is telling oil producers to
chill, baby, chill,
at least for now."

A layoff, especially if unexpected, can be devastating. You may have financial or health concerns on top of feelings of grief or identity loss. With so many unknowns, it can be difficult to plan for the future.
Before you do anything, ""pause,"" says
Octavia Goredema
, a career coach and the author of the book
Prep, Push, Pivot: Essential Career Strategies for Underrepresented Women
. ""Give yourself time to process your emotions.""
Life Kit
Being in between jobs is normal. Here's how to talk about it
Keep in mind that getting laid off has nothing to do with your worth. ""This is a business problem, not a
you
problem,"" Goredema says. ""This moment will not define you, and there's opportunity waiting for you.""
When you're ready, Goredema has practical tips on how to proceed. Here's a checklist of the most important steps to take first, so you can worry less about your logistics and focus more on the next opportunity.
Step 1: Take your time in wrapping things up with your employer.
✅ Review your exit paperwork thoroughly.
While it depends on your role, you'll likely receive paperwork related to vacation payouts, benefits information or severance packages. You could be asked to sign a noncompete agreement or nondisclosure agreement.
Sponsor Message
""You might not have seen this type of paperwork before,"" says Goredema, so ""read through everything carefully.""
✅ If you need more time to review your paperwork, ask for it.
""You might feel, 'If I don't sign this quickly, I might not get that money.' But if you sign something, you are then bound by those terms,"" she says.
✅ Negotiate your terms.
Goredema coached one person who rushed to sign their paperwork and discovered, after the fact, that they could've negotiated a longer time frame to receive health care benefits. So take the time to ask questions, and consider your options.
✅ Get a second opinion.
If you are concerned that you have been
wrongfully terminated
, consult an employment attorney, Goredema says. For a cost, an attorney can provide legal counsel and help determine whether your rights were violated.
Step 2: Secure benefits and health care.
✅ Apply for
unemployment insurance
as quickly as possible.
This state-run benefits program will pay you a weekly amount based on how much you earned before filing for unemployment. You qualify for it if you lose your job through no fault of your own. This extra payment can make a big difference in your financial security, Goredema says.
Sponsor Message
Each state manages its own unemployment insurance program, so ""clarify what your specific state offers and for how long,"" Goredema says. Most states provide compensation for up to 26 weeks, but a handful offer less than that, including Arkansas, Florida and Michigan.
✅ Look into additional benefits.
You may also qualify for other government benefits like food assistance or free job training. Use this
benefit finder
to see what programs are available to you.
✅ Find a health care alternative.
If you relied on your job for health insurance, you might be able to continue that plan. Most employers will offer
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) health coverage
, which gives you the right to keep your employer-provided health insurance for a limited period after a layoff.
""But that can be really expensive,"" Goredema says. The plan may require you to pay the full premium out of pocket, plus a 2% administrative fee.
If that won't work for you, there are other options. Look at what the
Health Insurance Marketplace
offers in your state. This is a government service that lets you compare and enroll in different coverage plans. You can also investigate programs like
Medicaid
, which provides free or low-cost health coverage to eligible low-income people.

Step 3: Plan your job search carefully.
✅ Take a moment to think about what you want to do next.
Reflect on your last job: What did you like? What did you dislike? What does your next job ideally look like? Consider compensation, the size of the company, proximity to home or the type of work you're doing.
Your answers to these questions will help you focus your search and weigh your offers down the line, Goredema says.
✅ Calculate your likely timeline for finding your next job.
This will help you budget accordingly and come up with a contingency plan in case your timeline needs to be extended.
Sponsor Message
""Think about how long it took you to find your last role,"" Goredema says. To be on the safe side, ""add another month or two months to that.""
Your timeline also depends on your industry. ""If the sector you work in is being [affected] by layoffs and if competition feels high, you may need to factor in extra time.""
Step 4. Create a financial plan.
✅ Use your timeline to create a monthly budget.
If you estimate it will take, say, six months to find your next job, divide your savings based on a six-month time frame.
Factor in emergency savings, severance pay, unemployment benefits or income from a partner or family member. This will help you stay on track financially as you search for a job, Goredema says.

Step 5: Plan for contingencies … and dream a little!
✅ Come up with a plan B.
If you don't find a job within your time frame, consider other creative ways to make an income while you continue your search, Goredema says. That might mean looking outside your industry, doing gig work like dog walking or making food deliveries, or going to a temp agency to find entry-level work.

✅ Don't feel bad if you have to pursue your backup plan.
""Five years from now, you'll look back on this time as an opportunity where you were able to problem-solve,"" Goredema says. ""You'll see it in a different perspective.""
✅ Challenge what you truly want from your career.
Is there a passion you've always dreamed of pursuing or a hobby you want to invest in?
Goredema remembers one client who went through multiple layoffs. Eventually, ""he got to the point where he was like, 'I can't do this anymore,'"" she says. He left his career in graphic design and started up his own gardening business instead. ""And he's so happy. He hasn't looked back.""

WASHINGTON — Investigators at the
National Transportation Safety Board
say there were multiple systemic failures that led to
a midair blowout
during the flight of a
Boeing 737 Max jet
last year, finding fault with safety procedures both at Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Grilled by Senate, Boeing CEO admits to 'serious missteps' on safety
No one was killed or seriously injured when the door plug panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy praised the crew for getting all 177 people on board back to the gate at Portland International Airport safely.
""This accident never should have happened,"" said Homendy. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident to Boeing,"" as well as to regulators at the FAA.
The
incident on January 5, 2024
raised major questions about
safety and quality control
at the aerospace giant. Seventeen months later, the members of the NTSB met in Washington to hear the results of the board's investigation.
Sponsor Message
The board concluded that the probable cause of the accident was ""Boeing's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight"" to its factory workers, according to a
meeting summary released by the NTSB
.
Investigators say they still don't know who reinstalled the door plug panel at Boeing's factory
without replacing four key bolts
that were supposed to hold it in place.
Even one of those four bolts could have prevented the door plug blowout during Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, NTSB investigators said on Tuesday. Those bolts were never found, and investigators believe they were likely discarded.

The NTSB had previously said that four bolts which were supposed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the Boeing 737 Max jet was delivered to Alaska Airlines in October 2023.
Boeing has no record of exactly who was responsible for removing and reinstalling the door plug, investigators said, making it impossible to pinpoint exactly who performed those tasks. Board chair Homendy said that points to bigger problems with Boeing's safety protocols.
""Boeing relied on a single point of failure, which was a human not filing or documenting a record,"" Homendy said. ""That was a flaw in the system.""
National
'Cozy' relationship between Boeing and the U.S. draws scrutiny amid 737 Max 9 mess
In addition, investigators found that Boeing relied on workers who had little formal training to carry out the tasks they were performing. They noted that the factory in Renton, Wash. where Boeing builds the 737 had lost many experienced workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
There were two dozen workers on the door team at the Boeing factory near Seattle that builds the 737 Max, according to investigators. But only one of them had previous experience removing a door plug panel — and he was on vacation in September 2023 when the door plug panel was removed and reinstalled.
Sponsor Message
The door plug blowout sparked a crisis at Boeing. Former CEO Dave Calhoun
announced he would step down
by the end of that year. The company replaced the top managers at its factory in Renton, and announced
a host of other changes
including more robust training for new employees. Current CEO Kelly Ortberg says Boeing has
only recently returned
to the production rate of 38 jets per month that it had been planning before the incident.
""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations,"" the company said in a statement.
""We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements.""
The NTSB concluded that regulators at the FAA also contributed to the accident by failing to ""adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues"" in its factories.
National
FBI letter tells Alaska Airlines passengers they are 'a possible victim of a crime'
The door plug incident prompted regulators at the FAA to
increase their oversight
of the factory where Boeing builds the 737 Max jets in Renton, Wash, and to temporarily cap production there at 38 planes per month.
""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the agency said in a statement. ""While Boeing is making progress, we will not lift the 737 monthly production cap until we are confident the company can maintain safety and quality while making more aircraft.""
Both Boeing and the FAA have improved their safety processes since the incident, according to the NTSB. Homendy praised Ortberg in particular for renewing the focus on safety at the company since he took over as CEO last summer, although she said there is still more work to do.
The incident was a major setback for Boeing, which was still working to rebuild trust with regulators and the flying public after the
deadly crashes of two 737 Max jets
in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.
Sponsor Message
The Department of Justice
told a federal judge last month
that it has reached an agreement in principle with Boeing to drop a criminal case over those crashes, despite objections from family members of some crash victims. It's the latest turn in a long-running legal saga over
how to hold the company accountable
for those crashes.
No one was seriously injured during the Alaska Airlines flight. The door plug panel blew out about six minutes after takeoff, and the plane was able to return to make an emergency landing in Portland. The incident occurred as the plane was climbing to about 15,000 feet; had it happened at the plane's cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, the outcome could have been very different.
""Frankly, it's nothing short of a miracle that no one died,"" Homendy said."

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that President Trump's tariffs pave a ""highly uncertain"" path for the U.S. economy, which warrants the central bank's wait-and-see approach to cutting interest rates.
""We do expect to show up — tariff inflation to show up more,"" Powell told
the House Financial Services Committee
. ""But I want to be honest, we really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through to the consumers. We just don't know. And we won't know until we see it. It could be lower than we expect; it could be higher. We have to wait and see, which is kind of what we're doing.""
Sponsor Message
Economy
Inflation is holding steady as Trump's tariffs have yet to fully hit
The Fed last week
left interest rates unchanged
, though policymakers signaled they remain on track for two rate cuts later this year. That decision came despite President Trump's continued campaign — and personal attacks on Powell — to press the independent central bank for faster interest rate cuts to boost the economy.
The Fed last week pointed to low employment, growing wages and ""decent"" economic growth as reasons to maintain — rather than ease — the cost of borrowing. And in his semi-annual report to Congress Tuesday, Powell reaffirmed this stance as he was asked why the Fed has not followed the faster pace of rate-cuts done by European central banks.
""The reason we're not is the forecast,"" the Fed chair said, ""all professional forecasters that I know of, on the outside and the Fed, do expect a meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.""
Many businesses might still be working through inventories that got shipped before the tariffs went into effect, Powell also said, adding that summer data should begin to show whether — or how much — consumer prices rise to cover new costs for U.S. importers.
President Trump has changed the level of his global tariffs several times in recent months, pausing many of them until next month as his administration continues to negotiate individual deals with countries. The Fed has been in a holding pattern on interest rates since December, after cutting borrowing costs by a full percentage point last year.
Sponsor Message
On Tuesday, the president again
attacked the Powell
, calling him a ""very dumb, hardheaded person.""
Economy
Trump tariff revenue soars 78%. Who's paying them?
Within the Fed, there is some openness to lowering interest rates more quickly. After last week's meeting, a couple of governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — said they were open to considering rate cuts as early as their next meeting in July.
The central bank is tasked with both maintaining stable prices and maximum employment.
Besides tariffs, the Fed is monitoring the combined effects of Trump's policies on taxes, immigration and regulation. Tax cuts and deregulatory moves have the potential to boost the economy while strict border controls and
large-scale deportations
could make it harder for businesses to find the workers they need."

The arrest of Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara in Georgia earlier this month highlights the risks journalists who are not citizens face under a Trump administration aggressively pursuing mass deportations.
Guevara is
currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody
after he live streamed his own arrest by local law enforcement for alleged unlawful assembly and obstruction of officers on June 14 while covering a ""No Kings"" protest in DeKalb County.
In a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said Guevara was not detained because he is a journalist. DHS said Guevara entered the country illegally in 2004 and urged him to ""self deport.""

His attorney, Giovanni Diaz, disputes that and told NPR that Guevara entered the U.S. legally on a tourist visa and has valid work authorization. Guevara also
has a pending application for adjustment of status
, which could result in him obtaining permanent residency.
Originally from El Salvador, Guevara has lived in the U.S. for about 20 years and built a large following covering immigrant communities in Georgia for Spanish-language media outlets and his independent outlet, MG News. On the day of his arrest, photos and video of the arrest clearly show Guevara wearing a vest with the words ""PRESS"" across the back and chest.
""I'm a member of the media, officer,"" Guevara can be heard saying

moments before his arrest as a row of law enforcement officers approach a sidewalk where he stood. As officers detain him, his phone falls to the ground and an officer picks it up at Guevara's request. The livestream partially shows Guevara being led away in handcuffs and then placed in a law enforcement vehicle.

a letter sent to DHS this week
, CPJ wrote that Guevara's case represents ""a grim erosion of both freedom of the press and the rule of law.""
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Leila Fadel:
So what is the Committee to Protect Journalists' concern here? Was he detained over his legal status or was he detained because of his work?
Katherine Jacobsen:
Guevara was initially detained because he was recording a protest. There are misdemeanor charges against him. It's highly irregular that any of those charges would actually be held up. We've seen this in many other cases. And simply put, Guevarra was doing his job and reporting the news. To use that as a pretext to hold him – a journalist – for a very long period of time in law enforcement detention, and then to transfer him to ICE detention after, that is something that we haven't seen before and is an incredibly alarming precedent to set.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
Fadel:
What protections exist for immigrant journalists like Guevara and others who are doing their jobs in the United States?
Jacobsen:
In theory, they enjoy the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen who is a reporter enjoy while they're out covering things. In the U.S., there are hundreds of foreign reporters. Many of them have a specific type of journalist visa, but some have other types of work authorization. And when a journalist who, again, is here legally is picked up by law enforcement and then his immigration status is called into question in the course of these legal proceedings, it's alarming.

So you sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security. What did you say in that letter? What were you asking for and what did they say back?
Jacobsen:
We sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking that Guevara be released immediately and pointed out that the whole reason why he was detained in the first place was because of charges relating to First Amendment activity. And we find that very problematic. We have not received a response. The Department of Homeland Security has also tweeted that the narrative about Guevara is false, though they have not specified further as to what the falsehoods are.

I think there is a great deal of reason for concern at this time, and it's important to make sure that those journalists have contact with a good immigration lawyer, as well as First Amendment lawyers, and have a clear understanding of their rights.

As celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Tom Brady descend on Venice for the destination wedding of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sánchez, some locals are protesting the event's extreme extravagance and what they see as the exploitation of their city.
Bezos — the Amazon founder and
Washington Post
owner — is one of the world's richest men, with an
estimated net worth
of $231 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. He and Sánchez — a former news anchor and licensed pilot — got engaged in 2023, four years after going public with
their relationship
.
Their nuptials have been the subject of speculation and intense secrecy ever since.

Activists in Venice say there's 'No Space For Bezos'
After returning from the brief — and widely panned —
all-female spaceflight
she organized on one of Bezos' Blue Origin rockets in April, Sánchez quipped that she had to make it back safely for her wedding, otherwise ""that would be a bummer for me.""
Sánchez's brother Paul has compared it to the 1981 royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer,
telling TMZ
in March, ""I think it's gonna be like a Princess Di thing.""
While precise details about the wedding remain under wraps, Italian media and global newswires report it will be held in Venice in late June. Reports of a multiday, multimillion-dollar affair — is expected to draw hundreds of celebrants to a fragile lagoon city already
grappling with overtourism
— sparked concerns in Italy.

In March, the
city of Venice
denied media reports that wedding organizers had reserved large numbers of gondolas and water taxis for the event, which had fueled fears of disruptions for the tourists and locals who use them for daily transport.
Venetian officials said there would be only 200 guests, an easily accommodated number for a city used to hosting all sorts of political summits, cultural events and VIP weddings (including George and Amal Clooney's in 2014).
""We are mutually working and supporting the organizers, to ensure that the event will be absolutely respectful of the fragility and uniqueness of the city,"" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said, according to the Associated Press.

But that hasn't stopped protesters from making their disapproval known.

It said ""no exaggerated quantity"" of water taxis or gondolas were booked, and the number of taxis reserved is ""proportionate for the number of guests.""

The Dutch vow to egg Jeff Bezos' yacht if a bridge is dismantled to let his boat pass
""From the outset, instructions from our client and our own guiding principles were abundantly clear: the minimising of any disruption to the city, the respect for its residents and institutions and the overwhelming employment of locals in the crafting of the events,"" the firm told NPR in a statement on Monday.
When asked for comment, an Amazon spokesperson referred NPR to the organizers' statement.
Simone Venturini, Venice's councilor for tourism, told NPR in a statement that the city is honored to host the wedding, which he said ""highlights our city's international appeal and its capacity to welcome high-profile events with both discretion and efficiency.""

""The objections voiced by a few dozen professional protesters — driven solely by a desire for media attention — do not represent the spirit of Venice; they reflect little more than social envy,"" Venturini added. ""Venice has always been — and remains — open, welcoming, and respectful, ready to embrace every visitor who honors our city's heritage.""
Here's what else we know — and still don't — about the wedding and the protests against it.
Where and when is the wedding?

Most reports say the wedding celebrations will span three days, but the exact dates vary.
Reuters and others
say the window
is likely June 26-28, while the AP — citing Italian media — previously reported it could be June 24-26.
There have been similarly conflicting reports about the ceremony's whereabouts.
A spokesperson for Brugnaro, Venice's mayor, told
CNN in March
that it would take place on Bezos'
417-foot superyacht
, the Koru. The ship has made headlines before: In 2022, the Dutch city of Rotterdam considered temporarily dismantling a historic bridge to allow the Koru to leave the shipyard where it was built — but reversed course after
residents protested
, including threatening to egg it.
Pop Culture Happy Hour
I do think we should be having more TV weddings
But other outlets,
including CNN
and
The Hollywood Reporter
, report that the couple may get married on the private island of San Giorgio Maggiore, specifically in a monastery there.
The ""No Space for Bezos"" activists, meanwhile, have said the wedding was to take place in the 14th-century Scuola Grande della Misericordia, a school armory-turned-event venue,
according to EuroNews
and CNN.
""Bezos will never get to the Misericordia,"" organizer Federica Toninello told supporters at a protest earlier this month,
per CNN
. ""We will block the canals, line the streets with our bodies, block the canals with inflatables, dinghies, boats.""
It seems protesters' efforts paid off. On Tuesday, the ""No Space for Bezos""
Instagram account
announced that the event scheduled for the Misericordia had been relocated to
the Arsenale
, according to translations from
Reuters
and
Newsweek
. It also said Bezos' two yachts, Koru and Abeona, will not be able to dock in Venice.

The Arsenale, a complex of former shipyards and armories, was the hub of Venice's naval industry starting in the 13th century. More recently, it is used as an exhibition site of the
Venice Biennale
, an international cultural event held annually in the city since 1895. The area is more isolated and secure than the Misericordia, with Reuters reporting that it is surrounded by water and ""impossible"" to reach by land once its connecting bridges have been raised.
Sandro Mattei, a native Venetian who lives near the Arsenale, told NPR on Thursday that while there are more police in the area, things are ""completely under control."" While he is used to disruptions from big annual events like the Venice International Film Festival, Mattei says the Bezos-Sánchez wedding prep hasn't been an inconvenience at all.
""The gondoliers, for example, do work normally as every day,"" he added. ""Everything is absolutely normal; there is nothing different with respect to all the other days of the year.""
Why are people protesting?
Protesters have displayed anti-Jeff Bezos posters and banners throughout Venice, where the tech billionaire is due to marry journalist Lauren Sánchez at the end of June.

Locals opposed to the wedding festivities have multiple concerns, ranging from logistical disruptions to environmental impacts of a sudden influx of yachts and private jets.
""Bezos is basically going to treat the whole city as a private ballroom, as a private event area, as if the citizens are not there,"" protester Alice Bazzoli
told Sky News
.
The island city is
actively sinking
due to rising sea levels and mass tourism. In an effort to curb the latter, it now requires day-trippers over the age of 14 to pay a
daily tax
on certain days (either 5 or 10 euros depending on timing) to visit its 2.5 square-mile historic city center.

Venice tests a 5-euro fee for day-trippers as the city grapples with overtourism
The massive influx of tourists has worsened the housing crisis, as many residential buildings have been converted into short-term rentals, and led to a drop in the population as many residents try their luck elsewhere.
It's against this backdrop that Bezos and Sánchez are arriving for their wedding, which regional governor
Luca Zaia has said
is expected to cost the equivalent of $23-$34 million. While Zaia says that will give a much-needed boost to the local economy, people protesting the event worry they won't personally experience the benefits of that money.

Not everyone agrees with the protesters. Mattei said ""99% of Venetian people are positive that Jeff Bezos is very welcome in Venice.""
Noting that tourism is critical to the local economy, his own job as a rental property manager included, Mattei said Venetians are proud to have been chosen as the wedding destination and eager to welcome guests.
""If the tourism is of a high level, like in this case with Jeff Bezos, it is the best for us,"" he added. ""People are in the luxury hotels, people go to the best restaurants, there [is] money for everybody.""
What has the response been to protests?
Venice's mayor, Brugnaro, told
reporters Friday
that he was ashamed of the protesters, saying ""we will have to apologize to Bezos.""
""I hope that Bezos comes anyway,"" he said. ""Not all Venetians think like these protesters.""
The wedding organizers, Lanza & Baucina Limited, said in their statement that since before the protests broke out, it had ""worked for there to be minimal negative impact or disruption to the lives of Venetians and the city's visitors.""

""We have always acknowledged the wider debate and critical issues surrounding the city's future, and from the outset our client has been honoured to support the city and its all-important lagoon through non-profit organisations and associated projects,"" the company added.
Bezos has made sizable contributions to Venetian charities in the lead-up to the wedding, including a million-euro donation to Corila, an academic consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem,
Reuters reports
. According to
the AP
, Corila confirmed over the weekend that Bezos' Earth Fund had made an ""important donation"" back in April, well before protests started.

The
AP reports
that at least two historic Venetian companies will contribute to the festivities: Rosa Salva, the city's oldest pastry maker, and Laguna B, a design studio famous for its distinctive, handmade Murano glassware.
Antonio Rosa Salva, the 6th generation in his family to run the bakery, said he will be supplying a selection of treats for guests' goody bags — and welcomes the honor.

The home sales slump in the U.S. continues: Last month was the slowest May for existing home sales since 2009.
Existing home sales in May fell 0.7% compared to the same month last year. Measured monthly, sales were up slightly, 0.8%, from the month before — but that marks an increase from
the slowest April
for existing home sales in 16 years.
National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun called the sales figures ""very stable, but at the sluggish sales activity level.""
The key challenge is affordability, with median home prices up 52% compared to May 2019, while wages gained 30% over that period, according to Yun. Meanwhile, sales activity is running at 75% of what it was pre-COVID, Yun added.

Right before COVID, the monthly payment for a home at the median price, including the prevailing interest rate, was roughly $1,000 a month, Yun said.
""Today it's a little over $2,000. So that doubling in the monthly payment for a new set of buyers is hindering the market condition,"" Yun added.
One thing that has changed in recent months is inventory: The number of homes for sale is up more than 20% over a year ago. Inventory has been rising in every region of the country, with the biggest upticks in the West and South,
according to Realtor.com
.

there are 34% more sellers than buyers in the U.S. now.
The condo market is especially rough for sellers. Condo sales in May were down 10% compared to a year earlier. By Redfin's estimation, there are 83% more condo sellers than buyers in the market.
Still, home prices have continued to rise, though much more slowly than during the pandemic. The median single-family home price in May was $427,800 — up 1.3% from May 2024.  For condos and co-ops, the median sales price was $371,300, up 0.7% from a year earlier.

Going into the spring housing market, many hoped that the market would improve as people would finally list their homes and buyers would  decide to take the plunge.
But buyers have been largely unmoved. Some would-be buyers cite concerns about possibly losing their jobs as well as about high mortgage rates, stock market volatility — and simply not knowing what the future holds.

In just 30 seconds,
the video
sprints from one unlikely scenario to another: a pot-bellied partier cradles a Chihuahua; a bride flees police on a golf cart; a farmer luxuriates in a pool full of eggs. Oddball details fill the screen, like a sign reading ""Fresh Manatee.""
""Kalshi hired me to make the most unhinged NBA Finals commercial possible,"" the video's creator, P.J. Accetturo,
said on X
.
The Kalshi ad had a high-profile debut, appearing in the YouTube TV stream of Game 3 of the NBA Finals on June 11. That placement, and the over-the-top content, might suggest weeks of work by a team of ad agency creatives, film crews and actors at far-flung locations. But Accetturo says he used AI tools instead, taking just two days to create an ad whose tone flits between internet memes and Grand Theft Auto.
Sponsor Message
One week after its streaming debut, the video also racked up more than 3 million views on
Kalshi's X account
. It's also raising questions about how AI might reshape advertising budgets.
""We are incredibly pleased with the outcome and effectiveness of the ad so far,"" Kalshi media representative Jack Such told NPR. ""It has generated a lot of buzz on social media.""
Accetturo, an advertising veteran, says AI will be a big part of the industry's future. Experts who spoke to NPR tend to agree, even if they're not yet sure how much the technology might displace jobs.
Like earlier advances, AI ""will lower the entry barrier for some of the smaller brands"" who can't afford a traditional video ad campaign, according to Alok Saboo, a professor of marketing at Georgia State University.
An AI ad that's a good fit for its subject
Kalshi describes itself as a
""prediction market,""
but its similarity to betting platforms has drawn
scrutiny from gambling regulators
. In the ad, Kalshi users shout their picks for who will win the NBA title: Oklahoma City or Indiana.
The ad's tone and placement make sense to marketing analyst Debra Aho Williamson — although she admits that, not having heard of Kalshi before, it took multiple views to decipher just what was being advertised.

Family shows AI video of slain victim as an impact statement — possibly a legal first
""Once I figured it out, I was like, OK, this is perfect,"" says Williamson, founder of Sonata Insights, a Seattle-based research and advisory service that focuses on artificial intelligence.
""You in 30 seconds showed multiple ways that you can wager on just everyday things,"" along with the excitement of rabid fan bases, she says of the ad.
A similar video featuring human actors could have captured the same energy, she says — ""but because they did it with AI, they're getting a lot of attention.""
Sponsor Message
How can AI make a wild video ad?
The process began with Kalshi giving Accetturo a list of themes, ideas and bits of dialogue, Such says. He then turned those concepts into a script and AI prompts — the instructions that tell AI systems what kind of content to generate.
Accetturo
shared many of his prompts and revisions
online, explaining how he used Google's Veo 3 AI video generator to create the ad. In
a tweet
, Accetturo said he also employed AI to help create the script, citing products from Google and Open AI.

""I co-write with Gemini (or ChatGPT) asking it for ideas, picking the best ones, and shaping them into a simple script,"" he wrote. He uses Gemini to convert the script into a detailed, shot-by-shot prompt for Veo 3. If the resulting video isn't what he's looking for, he puts the prompt back into Gemini, and asks for changes until he's satisfied with the AI-created footage.
The next step is to use video editing software to arrange each of the video clips together and add music.
""This took about 300–400 generations to get 15 usable clips,""
Accetturo said
. He added, ""Just because this was cheap doesn't mean anyone can do it.""
So, how much did the AI ad cost?
Accetturo says the Kalshi ad ran alongside spots that likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and months to produce, while his ad took two days, and cost much less.
Kalshi's Jack Such declined to disclose Accetturo's fee for creating the ad. But, he added, ""the actual cost of prompting the AI — what is being used in lieu of studios, directors, actors, etc. — was under $2,000.""
Then there's ""media time,"" the price marketers pay to get the ad in front of viewers. But as production costs fall, so does the price of experimentation.
""To me, I think the economics come down to just being able to execute more quickly and more economically, multiple types of ads, just try things,"" Williamson says. ""I mean, why wouldn't an advertiser want to just put a few concepts out? Try them with a small group of people, see if it works. And if it doesn't, then move on.
Sponsor Message
""That to me, I think is the way of the future.""
How might AI change advertising?
Both Williamson and Saboo compare the buzz around AI to the hype that
CGI effects
once enjoyed. And they note that this isn't the first AI ad to run during a big event. But previous attempts, like Coca-Cola's
revamping of a classic ad
, fell flat. Williamson points to
a study she was involved in last year
that found young people seem skeptical of AI.
""When we asked [Gen-Z and millennial] consumers in August of last year, how positively do you feel about ads generated with AI, only 48% said that they felt positively towards AI-generated advertising,"" she says.
As for how today's marketing students see AI, Saboo says it's a mixed picture.
""The students on one hand are using these tools to improve whatever they are doing,"" Saboo says. ""But as they move into the workforce, they are constantly being reminded of them having to compete with these tools. We like to tell them that in the end, whether they like it or not, they have to be good at them. They have to eventually think of [AI] as an extended version of Google or computers, or any of the tools that came before.""

Timbaland's AI music project is a ghost in a misguided machine
Williamson says that by sharing how he uses AI, Accetturo is helping to demystify a new and developing technology.
""I really applaud him for being as open about his methodology and how he was able to create the ad,"" she says. ""Because I think everybody can learn from that. Consumers can learn, but then the advertising industry can learn, too.""
In addition to lowering production costs, Saboo predicts AI will make it cheaper for marketers to personalize ads to target specific locations and audiences.
""You may see a different version of the ad than I can see,"" he says.
Sponsor Message
Asked about Kalshi's future plans, Such says the company wants to use AI in future advertising campaigns — but, he adds, ""we will not completely abandon more traditional forms.""
As Saboo puts it, ""in the end, humans want to connect with humans."""

In journalism, as in life, timing can be everything.
New Yorker
staff writer Evan Osnos' new collection of essays out in June,
The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich,
provides rich research and material for the conversation about extreme wealth in America today. The 10 related essays first began appearing in the
New Yorker
magazine in 2017.
Some, like the story on billionaire doomsday preppers, was groundbreaking. Others seem even more relevant today with a billionaire back in the White House supported by infinitely wealthier plutocrats such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and – until their recent falling out -- Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX fame. NPR's Frank Langfitt spoke with Osnos. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for space and clarity.

NPR's Book of the Day
Evan Osnos' 'The Haves and Have-Yachts' is a book of essays about the new Gilded Age
LANGFITT
: What first interested you in reporting and writing about the ultrarich?
OSNOS:
It was 2016 and the election of Donald Trump. You had voters who might tell you that they hate the elites in this country and somehow they were voting also for a billionaire from New York City. He was a creature of the money world and Americans have very ambivalent, complicated feelings about money. Last year there was a poll that found that about 60% of Americans will tell you that billionaires are making the country more unfair and almost an identical share of Americans will tell you that they themselves want to become billionaires.
LANGFITT:
What do you think this book shows people that they might not fully grasp?
OSNOS:
This book is actually about what it feels like to live in the new Gilded Age. I think we have an abstract sense that we're living at a time when inequality has widened and there is a group of people who are living, frankly, very far ahead in wealth terms than the rest of the country. But until you look at the numbers and you look at the actual details of that lifestyle, it can be hard to visualize.
Pop Culture Happy Hour
'Mountainhead' skewers the tech elite — and it's very satisfying
LANGFITT:
When you were reporting, were there one or two particular things that just astonished you?
OSNOS:
I remember hearing that there were pop stars who were beginning to play private events for kids, kids' birthday parties or bar mitzvahs and sweet sixteens, so I contacted the rapper Flo Rida and got to see what it's like when a pop star performs for a crowd of screaming 13-year-olds. It used to be that the richest people in the country might buy seats in a skybox at a stadium to watch a big performer and now, actually, they can afford to bring that performer to them.

LANGFITT:
Some of those performers actually don't want people to know who they're playing for, as you write about.
Goats and Soda

They keep it very low profile. There's an old saying in the private wealth management business, ""the whale that never surfaces doesn't get harpooned.""
LANGFITT:
One
of my favorite chapters is
The Floating World
about yachts. Tell everybody what a gigayacht is. I did not know.
OSNOS:
The gigayacht is a pleasure vehicle, a luxury boat, that is the length of a football field. It can cost upwards of $500 million. It is, in fact, the most expensive object that the human species has ever figured out how to own. A generation ago, there were only ten in the world. Today, there are 170.
LANGFITT:
I would think the high-end yachting world is very secretive. How did you get people to talk?
OSNOS
: There's pride in the sheer luxury of it. The most telling detail that I ever heard was something that the owner of a very expensive yacht told one of his guests. He said, ""it is ultimately the last true marker of great wealth. You have a chef and I have a chef. You fly private and I fly private. The only way that I can tell the world that I am in a different effing category than you is the boat."" I can't imagine a statement that is perhaps more evocative in capturing the internal engine of endless pursuit and acquisition and insatiable desire for more and more stuff.
LANGFITT:
How did you feel about these yachts when you were on them?
Goats and Soda
Melinda French Gates on what billionaires with 'absurd' wealth owe back to society
OSNOS:
I was writing this because I want someday for archeologists who are looking at our time, and they may come upon these giant boats and think, ""what were these giant arks, these sumptuous vessels, for?"" What did they tell us about the societies and the countries and the people that created them?
LANGFITT:
That's a dark image which leads us to another essay that I also found really interesting,
Survival of the Richest
, which was first published in 2017. You're talking to these super-rich doomsday preppers. Some of them are buying up apartments in converted missile silos. Others are buying land in guarded estates in New Zealand. What drew you to the preppers?
Sponsor Message
OSNOS:
It was a tip that I heard from a stranger. He worked in San Francisco in technology, and I said, ""Is there a story out there that you don't think is getting covered?"" He said, ""you should write about the guys who are preparing for the end of the world."" What really caught my attention was Silicon Valley's self-narrative, of course, was a place that was endlessly optimistic and yet there was a simultaneous subculture of people spending larger and larger sums to build bunkers and getaway plans. I came to see it as a kind of gilded despair. They had created platforms and technologies that just might slip out of their control and might generate a level of public disarray that could ultimately imperil them.
LANGFITT:
They also have a great fear of society just sort of collapsing. Do they see things, you think, that many of the rest of us don't?
OSNOS:
They have an insight precisely because of the technologies that they've created. In some ways, they are an early warning system. During the financial crisis of 2008, as Steve Huffman [CEO of Reddit] later described it to me, as the economy began to turn upside down, some of the first indications of it popped up in conversations on Reddit.
LANGFITT:
There are a bunch of lines in this essay that struck me. One is: You have to assure that the pilot's family will be taken care of, too. Explain what that literally and figuratively means.
OSNOS:
After the financial crisis in 2008, there was this feeling that perhaps the public is going to turn on wealthy people and if they have to escape, they'll get on their private planes. But then they began to run through all of this logistical planning. Well, what do you do about the pilot? What about his family? If you don't bring his family, will he in fact fly you to where you want to go, or will he maybe turn against you and take the jet and run? These sound like science-fiction scenarios, but these were conversations that were happening quietly around dinner tables.
Sponsor Message
LANGFITT:
Did you ever think that you had found yourself on the greed beat?
OSNOS:
I think that is the heart of the matter and it makes people sometimes uncomfortable to talk about greed, but it is an enduring fact of life and it's an engine of a lot that happens in this country. What's new is the many ways in which we have created instruments and expressions and applications of that greed to be able to maximize it to its most extravagant and indulgent form. That's the culture of excess that I'm describing in these pages."

On Friday, the Trump administration issued
mass layoff notices
gutting the agency that owns the Voice of America and funds its sister news outlets.
That same day, a correspondent arrested in Azerbaijan while working for one of those sister networks — Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty — was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges his bosses consider bogus.
Given recent headlines about their employers, other journalists for the federally funded news outlets who are foreign citizens say they wonder whether they will have the U.S. government's support if they become victims of political retribution by their countries' leaders.

About 1,400 jobs, or 85% of positions, are being eliminated at the U.S. Agency for Global Media in keeping with
an executive order
issued in mid-March by President Trump, senior White House adviser Kari Lake said on Friday. The cuts all but wipe out the Voice of America, which has broadcast news coverage and cultural programs to people living under repressive regimes since World War II.
""For decades,"" Lake said in a written statement, ""American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that's been riddled with dysfunction, bias, and waste. That ends now.""
People who had been working for the agency prior to Trump's second term took grave exception to her actions.
""The scope of the agency's actions appears massive and would eviscerate Voice of America's congressionally mandated role to provide objective news to closed societies and other places around the world,"" Michael Abramowitz, the Voice of America's director, said in a letter to colleagues. He is currently on involuntary paid administrative leave but had not received a layoff notice by Friday afternoon.
Before these new notices to staffers, Lake already had fired more than 500 contractors at Voice of America, many of whom are citizens of other countries and brought journalistic and language skills to their roles at VOA. Lake has been seeking to hold back payments designated by Congress to the other government-funded international networks, which are technically private nonprofits. Those include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.

Lake's actions have cast doubt on the government's commitment to non-American journalists working around the world
for those networks.  Some have risked their lives and their livelihoods to cover thorny issues affecting their home countries.
""I am very concerned about the fate of many of our journalists at Voice of America,"" Abramowitz tells NPR.  ""The U.S. government has a moral obligation to do everything in its power to make sure those who worked on its behalf stay out of harm's way.""
The case of Farid Mehralizada
On Friday, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter Farid Mehralizada was
sentenced to nine years in jail
in his native Azerbaijan for smuggling, tax evasion, and forgery — charges that network executives and human rights groups say are false. In a statement read in court, Mehralizada, who is also an economist, said he had sought through his reports to offer his expertise on the challenges facing the country with his fellow Azerbaijanis.
""The only way to achieve sustainable economic development in any country is for citizens to understand the essence of economic processes, to ensure participation in decision-making, and to guarantee freedom of expression,"" Mehralizada said in his statement, which was shared with NPR. ""Unfortunately, journalism in our country today is almost equated with terrorism.""
During his more than year-long imprisonment awaiting trial, Mehralizada missed the birth of his child. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty President and CEO Stephen Capus called for Mehralizada to be returned to his family.
""RFE/RL's U.S.-funded journalists work in some of the most dangerous environments imaginable,"" Capus said. ""Farid's case is a tragic example of the risks that come with reporting uncomfortable truths.""
Colleagues at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are similarly imprisoned in Belarus, Russia, and Russia-occupied Crimea.
A ray of hope for press advocates about the administration's direction arrived in the form of welcome news on Saturday, when a former colleague at the network, Ihar Karnei, was released by Belarus after four years in prison.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Capus expressed gratitude to Trump for helping to secure Karnei's release and thanked Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the government of Lithuania ""for their support of our imprisoned journalists.""
On Sunday, Capus announced that another of the network's journalists, Vladyslav Yesypenko, was released by authorities in Russian-occupied Crimea. Capus said he was tortured by the Russians, physically and psychologically. RFE/RL expressed gratitude to the U.S. and Ukrainian governments.
Three Vietnamese freelance journalists for Radio Free Asia are currently serving prison terms ranging from six to 11 years in Vietnam.
Three journalists for the Voice of America are in prison as well, in Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Vietnam.
A scramble to find refuge
VOA journalists who are citizens of countries where the government represses the media, or is hostile to the U.S., fear what will happen if they return home when their non-immigrant J-1 visas expire at the end of the month.
Many are scrambling — with help from colleagues — to find other jobs in the U.S. Some are seeking asylum.
The half-dozen Voice of America journalists in this situation who spoke with NPR come from countries in Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia. They share a similar refrain: They say if they return home, they are likely to be prevented from working, imprisoned or worse.
One reporter for a foreign language service of Voice of America says he fears returning to his West African home. (NPR is not using his name or his home country at his request for fear of repercussions for him and his family members.)
Media outlets in his country are shut down when they cover the regime critically — or even when they simply report on protests. Foreign news organizations can be thrown out. He says he came to the U.S. because it became increasingly perilous to report openly in his home country or neighboring nations.

""They're not going to throw me a parade,"" the Voice of America journalist tells NPR. ""They see people working for international networks as a spy. I can just disappear, you know? They could kidnap me or [I could] go to jail.""

""It's just a gut punch""
Ivana Konstantinovic was a news anchor and producer based in Washington D.C. for the Voice of America's Serbian-language service until her contract was terminated as part of Lake's mass firings of contractors this spring. She was fired once before, during the first Trump administration, but returned two years ago. She says Serbia is not as repressive as Russia but reporting there is fraught. An analysis by the
Committee to Protect Journalists
found that attacks against members of the media there are on the rise.
""Serbia is a country where [the] government targets independent journalists,"" Konstantinovic says in a text message. ""We were all invited here to D.C. because of our experience, language skills, connections with target audience, understanding of the political landscape, etc. VOA needed us.""
Voice of America's press freedom editor, Jessica Jerreat, argues that Trump's executive order wrongly sends the opposite message.
""Now they're just discarded,"" Jerreat says of the foreign journalists. ""After this executive order, you're no longer needed. It's just a gut punch for all the service and expertise these people bring.""
Jerreat, who is among the Voice of America staffers now suing the network, received her own termination notice on Friday."

The U.S. has been policing bribery all over the world for nearly half a century using a law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But now, President Trump has said that this anti-corruption law is crippling American businesses. Since taking office, his administration has reduced the number of investigators, killed some cases, and changed the rules.
In this episode, we look at the FCPA case against Glencore, a large commodity trading company, found guilty in 2022 for paying cash bribes in exchange for lucrative contracts all over the world.
And we go back to the inception of the law, a time when using bribes to pay off foreign officials was considered ""grease in the wheels"" - a reasonable (if unethical) way to get business done.

Senior White House adviser Kari Lake issued mass layoff notices Friday to 639 employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the federal outlet which owns the Voice of America and through which Congress directs money for other government-funded international networks, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.
The vast majority of the job cuts, intended to be a permanent reduction in the size of the workforce, affects Voice of America, the government-owned international network that has beamed news reports to countries under autocratic regimes since World War II.
In a press release, Lake called her action ""part of a long-overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy."" She said 85% of jobs, or 1,400 positions, had been eliminated in total, in keeping with
an executive order
in mid-March from President Trump.
Sponsor Message
""For decades,"" she added, ""American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that's been riddled with dysfunction, bias, and waste. That ends now.""
Lake had effectively silenced the Voice of America in March by putting the workforce on leave and also sought to cut off all funding approved by Congress for the other networks. Last month, the agency fired more than 500 contractors.
In the past week, as the conflict between Israel and Iran heated up, Lake brought back dozens of staffers to resurrect the Persian-language service. A significant number of those called back received the layoff notice on Friday too, according to several staffers, including one from the Persian-language newsroom. They spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity, citing fear of repercussions.
This move ""spells the death of 83 years of independent journalism that upholds U.S. ideals of democracy and freedom around the world,"" three employees suing Lake said in a joint statement. The three staffers are Voice of America White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara and Press Freedom Editor Jessica Jerreat and U.S. Agency for Global Media Director of Strategy Kate Neeper.
""We call on Congress to continue its long tradition of bipartisan support for VOA,"" they said. ""Moscow, Beijing, Tehran and extremist groups are flooding the global information space with anti-American propaganda. Do not cede this ground by silencing America's voice.""
Interview highlights
Former DOGE engineer says federal waste and fraud were 'relatively nonexistent'
They are among those who received the layoff notices. The reduction in force is to take effect Sept. 1.
""The scope of the agency's actions appears massive and would eviscerate Voice of America's congressionally mandated role to provide objective news to closed societies and other places around the world,"" said Michael Abramowitz, the Voice of America's director, who had not received a layoff notice by Friday afternoon, but is currently on involuntary paid administrative leave.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks have each sued Lake and the Trump administration as have journalists from Voice of America in separate litigation.
Sponsor Message
Lake has revived claims that the agency has operated with such poor security that its networks are rife for espionage by foreign powers, assertions made by Trump's appointee to lead it in 2020, toward the end of his first term.
Lake is set to appear Wednesday at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is led by U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican who is a Trump ally. The title of the hearing is ""Spies, Lies and Mismanagement: Examining the U.S. Agency for Global Media's Downfall.""
""I am not a traitor,"" said Anita Powell, Voice of America's senior White House correspondent before nearly the entire network's workforce was put on leave by Lake earlier this year. ""I dispute this mass mischaracterization of me and my colleagues, who have dedicated years to serving our wonderful country."" She received her own termination letter mid-afternoon Friday."

Handout/FreshRealm Inc./USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service
Some ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart are being voluntarily recalled following a nationwide listeria outbreak linked to 17 illnesses and three deaths as well as one fetal loss.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it is investigating the outbreak of
Listeria monocytogenes
, which they say has been traced to products made by FreshRealm, Inc. under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart.
""FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers,"" the agency said in a
statement
. ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.""
Sponsor Message
FreshRealm initiated a voluntary recall ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the company said in a statement, adding,  ""The company has not received any direct reports of illness associated with the product.""
""FreshRealm remains committed to the highest standards of food safety,"" the statement said.
The Food and Drug Administration
reports
that as of June 18, people in 13 states have reported becoming ill after eating precooked meals. ""Of the 17 cases under investigation, 16 were hospitalized and there are 3 deaths attributed to listeriosis. There is one pregnancy associated illness in a mother that resulted in a fetal loss,"" the FDA said.
According to the FSIS, the current strain was initially identified in sick people on dates ranging from August 2024-May 2025. That same outbreak strain was discovered in a FreshRealm facility during routine testing of its chicken fettuccine alfredo. The lot of meals including the tested sample was held, destroyed and never entered commerce.
Subsequent investigations at the facility did not uncover the source of the contamination and FSIS said it is still investigating whether a specific ingredient in the meals is the source of the outbreak.
In the meantime, they caution consumers to beware of the following products:
32.8-oz. tray packages containing ""MARKETSIDE GRILLED CHICKEN ALFREDO WITH FETTUCCINE Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken and Shaved Parmesan Cheese"" with best-by date 06/27/25 or prior.
12.3 oz. tray packages containing ""MARKETSIDE GRILLED CHICKEN ALFREDO WITH FETTUCCINE Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken, Broccoli and Shaved Parmesan Cheese"" with best-by date 06/26/25 or prior.
12.5 oz. tray packages containing ""HOME CHEF Heat & Eat Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with pasta, grilled white meat chicken, and Parmesan cheese"" with best-by date 06/19/25 or prior.
Sponsor Message
The FSIS warns that consuming food contaminated with listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Sometimes those symptoms can be preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal issues. It is most dangerous in pregnant women, as the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. It can also cause fatal infections in older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics."

Every year, the U.S. government spends more money than it takes in. In order to fund all that spending, the country takes on debt. Congress has the power to limit how much debt the U.S. takes on. Once we reach that limit, Congress has a few options so that the government keeps paying its bills: Raise the debt limit, suspend it, or eliminate it entirely.
Which is daunting, because if lawmakers don't figure something out in time, the ramifications for the global economy could be huge.

As hostilities between Iran and Israel escalate and President Trump raises the possibility of U.S. military involvement in the conflict, some of his influential supporters online are publicly disagreeing with him, a rare occurrence in the pro-Trump media sphere.
A day after Israel launched its attack on Iran, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson wrote a newsletter titled ""An Act of War, Sponsored by the United States"" and talked about his objections with former Trump advisor Steve Bannon on Bannon's War Room podcast.
Trump fired back at Carlson on Monday evening,
writing on Truth Social
: ""Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,"" IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!""""

Politics
Trump threatens Iran's supreme leader, escalating his rhetoric about the conflict
Since then, multiple pro-Trump influencers defended Carlson and publicly disagreed with Trump over the issue.
""Donald Trump just completely fractured his base. Truly unbelievable,"" wrote commentator Candace Owens on X less than an hour after Trump's post.
One of Trump's closest congressional allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., also quickly came to Carlson's defense.
""Tucker Carlson is one of my favorite people."" she posted on X. ""Foreign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That's not kooky.""
InfoWars host Alex Jones, who has a history of spreading conspiracy theories, posted later in the evening: ""Trump attacking @TuckerCarlson for not supporting a new WORLD WAR is not something any sane person should support! This is the stuff NIGHTMARES are MADE of…""
""They're playing out the battle in the way based on the positions they've advocated for for ages,"" said Daniel Silverman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University whose research includes how information travels during conflicts. ""Tucker [Carlson]'s been very consistent on not picking fights with Iran back to the first Trump administration…It is notable that they're doing it so openly.""
Initial polling suggests that many Americans have concerns about the U.S. militarily engaging with Iran. A weekly
YouGov/Economist poll
published Tuesday found that 60% of Americans across the political spectrum don't think the US military should be involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

In the House, representatives from
both parties
including Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., are seeking to require the president to get congressional approval before military intervention in the conflict. Lawmakers made a similar attempt during the first Trump administration but were unable to overcome the president's veto power.
Still, some right-wing social media influencers do support Trump's actions.
""America First is whatever President Trump says it is,"" wrote Laura Loomer, an activist close to Trump who had previously challenged the president's acceptance of a 747 from Qatar to serve as a new Air Force One.
Activist Charlie Kirk, who led Trump's canvassing effort during the election, posted on X: ""Moments like this I have full and complete trust in President Trump"".
Elections
Laura Loomer has been a topic of conversation in Trump's campaign. Here's what to know
Others have tried to strike a tone of unity, like Jack Posobiec, a prominent far-right influencer. ""When people warn that regime change war would break up the MAGA Coalition, consider that is exactly what the neocons want"" he wrote on X.
Later, he suggested that Trump's rhetoric might serve his domestic agenda. ""What if 20 million illegals were suddenly disappeared while cable news is focused on the Middle East? Chess not checkers.""
Vice President JD Vance chimed in on X: ""I can assure you that he [Trump] is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals.""
Unlike many high-profile social media figures, major right-wing news sites and opinion pages have been almost unanimously supportive of the U.S.'s backing of Israel, said Howard Polskin, who runs The Righting, a website that monitors right-wing media.
""The right-wing media is supporting the vision of Trump as a powerful figure, controlling the destinies of not only our country and our politicians. But he's also controlling the fate to some extent of Israel and Iran and its citizens,"" said Polskin.

But so far, articles in the outlets Polskin follows have yet to discuss the prospects of troops on the ground. ""In the next day or two, we may see more of that,"" he said.
About an hour after Vance's post, Trump's rhetoric escalated. ""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding"", he posted on Truth Social on Tuesday. That was quickly followed by another post demanding ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"""

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday putting more time on the clock for the popular short video app TikTok, five months after the start date of a
federal law
banning it in the U.S. unless it splits with its Beijing-based owner, ByteDance.
The order grants the company a 90-day reprieve from enforcement of The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications
Act
, which Congress passed with bipartisan support last year and former president Biden signed into law. It was slated to take effect in January.

Technology
President Biden signs law to ban TikTok nationwide unless it is sold
The extension is Trump's third such lifeline for the app since taking office, ordering the Department of Justice to take no enforcement action nor impose penalties against any entity for noncompliance with the law.
In a
statement
posted online, TikTok said it is ""grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform.""
The executive order comes in the wake of a high-stakes meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in London last week where the two sides
agreed on a framework
to get stalled trade negotiations back on track. Analysts say the fate of TikTok is linked to the broader trade spat.
The law demands that TikTok, which the company said in early 2024 was used by more than half of Americans, should not be controlled by a company in China. Lawmakers worried that it could be used to spy on, or influence, American users.
TikTok fought the ban all the way to the Supreme Court, calling it a violation of free speech rights — but the high court
upheld the law
.

Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban, threatening app's existence in the U.S.
The ban was slated to go into effect on January 19, 2025, the day before Trump took office. Just before midnight on January 18,
TikTok took itself offline
and disappeared from app stores. The following morning, although still not yet in office, Trump promised he'd pause enforcement of the ban, and
the app came back online
.
On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an
executive order
effectively pushing back the start of the ban by 75 days, and promising immunity for other tech companies that provide back end services for the app, such as Apple and Google, which offer it in their web stores.

In April, as the new deadline approached,
a deal
seemed to be taking shape that would have handed a majority stake to a consortium of U.S. companies, allowing them to license TikTok's algorithm. But
the deal collapsed
after Trump slapped sky-high tariffs on China and fired National Security Council officials, one of whom was involved in the TikTok deal. He granted the company another 75-day reprieve, with an end date on June 19.
In an email to NPR, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu reiterated Beijing's pledge to handle ""relevant matters"" according to Chinese laws and regulations.
""The U.S. side should provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for the companies concerned operating in the United States,"" Liu said.
Some legal experts say Trump's delays run afoul of the law banning TikTok, which allows for a single 90-day extension but only if certain conditions are met, like certifying to Congress that a divestiture from ByteDance is in motion.
Speaking before the latest promise of an extension, Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington law school who follows tech, says Trump has operated outside the statutory framework so far.
""This president is not operating within Congress's intent,"" he said. ""It sets a bad precedent, wherein the president feels like he can simply ignore a congressional statute.""
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-VA) issued a statement accusing the Trump administration of ""flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings"" about the risks posed by a Chinese-controlled TikTok. ""An executive order can't sidestep the law, but that's exactly what the president is trying to do.""
The White House did not return a request for comment on the legal grounds for these extensions.
For his part, Trump contends that he is operating within the bounds of the law. Asked on Tuesday if he had the legal basis to extend the reprieve, Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One: ""Yeah, sure. Yeah, we do.""
Business
TikTok is back on the Apple and Google app stores
Moves by Trump and his administration to
assure TikTok and its service providers
that U.S. authorities will not prosecute anyone under the law have been enough for the popular app to stay online. Apple and Google
restored TikTok
to their app stores in February.
Calo says these companies are at risk because ""every company that helps bring TikTok to Americans is technically violating an act of Congress right now and has been for months.""
""They're taking a risk by continuing to support TikTok on the strength of this president's commitment that he's not going to prosecute, because it doesn't say that, you know, people that are helping TikTok are off the hook,"" Calo said. Although Trump's
January executive order
says the Justice Department ""shall take no action"" to enforce the ban or administer penalties, he says, ""There are zero guarantees.""

The Social Security trust fund is expected to run out of cash in eight years, according to a report released Wednesday by the program's trustees. Unless Congress acts before then, benefits for more than 60 million retirees and family members will automatically be cut by 23%.
The deadline is about nine months earlier than trustees were predicting a year ago. The change was primarily caused by a
new law
that increased benefits for nearly 3 million former public-sector workers who had pensions for jobs not covered by Social Security. Trustees also lowered their assumptions about future wages (and resulting payroll taxes) and birth rates.
Sponsor Message
More Americans have started drawing Social Security benefits
at a younger age
, partly out of fear that benefits could be lower in the future.

Why there's an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security
Business
No more pennies: In big change, Treasury will stop minting them
The popular program's most basic challenge is demographic. The population of the United States is aging, with more than 11,000 baby boomers reaching retirement age daily.
For each person drawing Social Security, there are now fewer young workers paying taxes to support the system. The trust fund, built up over decades when baby boomers were working, provides a backstop for now. But once that money is gone, incoming payroll taxes will cover just 77% of promised retirement benefits.
A separate trust fund, supporting Social Security disability payments, is projected to remain solvent through 2099. If the two funds were combined — which would take an act of Congress — the pooled fund would last through 2034, after which benefits would automatically be cut by 19%.
Not increasing Social Security revenue is the same as ""supporting benefit cuts""
Congress could address the shortfall in a number of ways — by raising taxes, cutting benefits or some combination of the two.
""Taking action sooner rather than later will allow consideration of a broader range of solutions and provide more time to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare,"" the trustees said in a statement.
Sponsor Message
Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, warned that lawmakers had already dragged their feet too long.
""At this point, any member of Congress without a plan to fix Social Security is shirking their duty to preserve the nation's largest and most important government program,"" MacGuineas said.
President Trump has vowed not to touch Social Security benefits. But if no changes are made to the program, the law calls for benefits to be cut automatically, once the trust fund is exhausted.
""Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,"" says Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works.
Taxing higher-income earners would help provide revenue
Currently, top earners don't pay Social Security taxes on any income above $176,100 a year.  Altman says assessing Social Security taxes on higher income, including investment income, would provide enough revenue to keep paying full Social Security benefits through the end of the century.
""America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world, at the wealthiest moment in our history,"" Altman says. ""That money can remain concentrated in the hands of billionaires, or it can go towards Social Security, enriching all of our lives.""
Congressional Republicans have in the past proposed alternative fixes, including
raising the retirement age
for younger workers and reducing the benefits formula.
The trustees' report comes as the Social Security Administration is
cutting thousands of employees
, or about 12% of its workforce, leading to longer telephone wait times and reduced in-person appointments.
Altman argued that those staff cuts — made in the name of government efficiency — have done little to address Social Security's long-term financial challenges.
""Today's report is a reminder that even as DOGE's cuts to the Social Security Administration are wrecking Social Security's customer service, they are doing nothing to improve its solvency,"" Altman said.

The trustees also projected that a Medicare trust fund that helps cover hospital insurance will be depleted in eight years. That's three years earlier than projected last year, as a result of rising medical costs. Once the fund is exhausted, Medicare will have sufficient funds to cover only 89% of promised benefits."

Whether or not these toys are in fact ""cute"" is up for debate. But there's no denying that their toothy, mischievous grins and furry bodies have become a global sensation — sparking long lines outside toy stores, selling out online within minutes, and listing for double or triple their original price on resale markets.

Last week, a life-size Labubu figure sold for more than $170,000 at the first Labubu art auction hosted by Yongle Auction in China. The event drew nearly 1,000 bidders, according to Yongle.
In the latest Word of the Week, we delve into the meaning and story behind Labubu — as well as, what its rise reveals about today's consumers.
Where does the name 'Labubu' come from?
Before they became highly sought-after collectibles, Labubus were storybook characters created by the artist
Kasing Lung
.
Born in Hong Kong, Lung moved to the Netherlands at age 7, where he quickly fell in love with Nordic fairy tales — especially those about elves. Inspired by the whimsical folklore, Lung launched an illustrated book series called
The Monsters
in 2015, featuring a playful tribe of female elves known as Labubus.
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by Kasing Lung (@kasinglung)
""That's why I wanted to create something that I've always known existed in my heart,"" he said in an interview with
CGTN Europe
in March. ""It's amazing that so many people love it.""
Labubus are described as kind-hearted and eager to help — though their good intentions can sometimes lead to chaos. According to Lung, there are about
100 different Labubus
in the series. One of the storylines involves a Labubu who's dating a shy skeleton named Tycoco and often playfully teases him.
How Labubu became a global sensation
Lung released an artistic toy series inspired by the characters not long after
The Monsters
trilogy came out.
But the toy collection did not cause a global craze until he teamed up with Chinese toy company POP MART in 2019.
According to
POP MART
, the revenue generated from the first
Monsters
series launch ""broke the sales record in the art toy category."" Over the years, it has been spotted
on the bags of pop singers like Dua Lipa, Rihanna, and Lisa from the K-pop group BLACKPINK.

In the U.S., one Labubu blind box retails for $27.99. But high demand often drives resale prices much higher. On eBay, a rare secret Chestnut Cocoa Labubu can fetch over $149.
The global craze around Labubus has also sparked markets for doll clothing and counterfeit Labubus, which are sometimes called ""Lafufus.""
What does the blind box craze say about today's consumers?
The concept of blind boxes isn't new. It taps into a long-standing fascination with mystery and chance, according to Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, a curator at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, N.Y.
Think back to cereal box prizes, capsule toys from vending machines, or Japan's lucky bags, which are sealed bags filled with random items as a way for retailers to get rid of leftover stock, Parnett-Dwyer said. Even trading cards, such as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh, offer a similar thrill.

"" I think there's a lot of things where the popularity among adults or young adults stems from childhood nostalgia,"" Parnett-Dwyer said.

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday, and signaled that it is on track to cut rates by 0.5 percentage point this year, even as
policymakers wait to see how President Trump's tariffs and fighting in the Middle East will affect the U.S. economy.
The Fed has been in a holding pattern since December, after cutting rates by a full percentage point last year.

And while the outlook continues to remain uncertain, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that some measures of inflation had moved up.
""Respondents to surveys of consumers, businesses and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor,"" Powell said at a press conference.
A statement from members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested that the Fed would likely cut borrowing costs by an average of half a percentage point later this year, which was similar to what they were forecasting in March, before Trump announced his worldwide tariffs.
The new projections call for slightly higher inflation and unemployment and slightly lower economic growth than policymakers expected three months ago.

Bonds aren't doing well, and that's not good for America
The government's own borrowing costs are set by the bond market, which is not directly tied to the short-term rates set by the Fed. And those borrowing costs have only risen in recent months.
Bond yields ordinarily fall during times of turmoil, as investors flock to the safety of U.S. government debt. But yields on Treasury bonds unexpectedly rose last week after Israel's attack on Iran, suggesting investors are not as confident in the U.S. government's creditworthiness as they once were.

The combination of high debt and rising bond yields can be costly not just for the government but also for taxpayers. Interest on the federal debt totaled $776 billion in the first eight months of the fiscal year — the government's third-biggest expense after Social Security and Medicare.
The higher bond yields also make mortgages, car loans and other types of consumer borrowing more expensive.
Foreign-born workforce shrinks by 1 million people
In addition to tariffs, the Fed is monitoring the combined effects of Trump's policies on taxes, regulation and immigration. Tax cuts and deregulatory moves have the potential to boost the economy while strict border controls and
large-scale deportations
could make it harder for businesses to find the workers they need.
The foreign-born workforce shrank by more than a million people in the last two months, according to surveys from the Labor Department.
Fewer immigrant workers could ""add meaningful upward pressure to inflation by the end of the year in sectors reliant on immigrant labor such as agriculture, construction, food processing, and leisure and hospitality,"" Fed Governor Adriana Kugler warned in a

Planeloads of some of America's best engineers flying to China to train its workforce in how to do advanced manufacturing. A jaw-dropping level of investment in China's development, which puts the Marshall Plan to shame. When Apple came to China, the company proved instrumental in helping the country become a manufacturing juggernaut. And now one of America's most valuable companies is awkwardly dependent on the production capabilities of a country that has become one of America's biggest adversaries.

A
new book
from
Financial Times
journalist Patrick McGee, titled
Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company
, offers the wild story of how Apple became so deeply entangled with China. Depending on your point of view, it could be the story of the wonders of capitalism in lifting a nation out of poverty while delivering the world cheaper, more advanced electronics. Or, if you're wary of China's geopolitical rise, it could be the story of how an icon of American ingenuity may have unwittingly threatened our country's national security and its lead in technological innovation.
An origin story for Apple's entanglement in China
In 1999, Terry Gou, the head of a then little-known Taiwanese company named Foxconn, made a fateful phone call to a young operations executive who'd just joined Apple: Tim Cook (yeah, the future CEO of Apple).
Apple was on the verge of what the company hoped would be a big comeback. Two years before, it had almost declared bankruptcy. Under pressure, Apple rehired (and acquired a startup of) their visionary co-founder Steve Jobs, whom they had unceremoniously pushed out a decade before. Everything was now riding on the success of a new personal computer Jobs and his team had developed: the iMac.
Sponsor Message
The iMac was not a typical computer. It wasn't rectangular or beige, gray, or white. It had a more round-ish, teardrop shape with a translucent plastic casing that came in a variety of bright candy colors. Like many other Apple products in the years to come, the iMac had a cutting-edge design that required meticulous manufacturing.
For much of its early history, Apple had manufactured its products in America. After the company was founded in 1976, McGee writes, it employed Steve Jobs' sister Patty to hand assemble its first computer's circuit boards. When it released the much more popular Apple II computer in 1977, the company reportedly turned to a woman in Los Altos, California, who enlisted a ragtag network of immigrants, including undocumented ones, to assemble circuit boards and power supplies in crowded apartments and houses around the Bay Area.
""No one ever mentioned minimum wage, or Social Security, or workplace safety laws,"" writes Michael Malone in
Infinite Loop
, a 1999 book about Apple. ""And thus, for more than a year, the Apple II, promoted as the machine to liberate people from the slavery of bureaucracies and office work, was in fact being partially assembled in sweatshops.""
When the money started pouring in, Apple set up a more legitimate factory in the Bay Area. While it did work with overseas suppliers on certain parts and products, the company was much slower and less willing than other computer companies to completely outsource and offshore production. Apple had more creative designs than other computer brands (sometimes called ""PC clones"") and was obsessed with a level of quality that, for a long time, they believed only they could deliver in their own factories.
But, after its financial troubles in the mid-1990s, Apple began increasingly contracting out manufacturing work in an effort to slash costs, increase efficiency, and boost its stock price. Its competitors — who were winning at the time — already had.
Sponsor Message
In 1999, when this call between Cook and Gou happened, Apple was making products in a mix of its own factories and other companies' factories across three continents, from California to Ireland to Japan.
The iMac's monitor, which made up most of the computer, was initially manufactured by the South Korean conglomerate LG. As demand for the iMac exploded, LG struggled to keep up. Apple wanted the company to replicate their three-continent production strategy, McGee writes, and LG agreed by setting up new factories in Wales and Mexico. Each factory proved to be a disaster, leading LG to drop the ball on production at a critical time for Apple's business. Meanwhile, LG was proving to be stubborn when it came to contract negotiations.
Somehow word of these troubles got to Foxconn's Terry Gou. Foxconn had for years been a small-time supplier of cheap component parts for Apple, but it had recently proven itself in making the external housing for Apple's Power Mac G4 desktop. Gou dreamed of a much grander relationship with the American company. And, with LG struggling, he saw an opening.
That's when he called Tim Cook, whom he had previously worked with when Cook was at Compaq, an American computer company that was a big Foxconn client.
""I can fix this,"" Gou reportedly said.
McGee writes that it was the start of a much closer business relationship that would revolutionize not just both companies, but also the economic fate of China and potentially the geopolitical balance of power.
How Chinese manufacturing got much more advanced
Although Foxconn is headquartered in Taiwan, the company's success has long been dependent on its factories in mainland China, which it began to shift to in the 1980s as Taiwanese labor costs began to rise.
Starting in the 1980s, Foxconn's Terry Gou and other Taiwanese entrepreneurs — known as the ""Taishang"" in China — helped develop what became known as ""the Guangdong Model"" on the east coast of southern China (Guangdong is a province there). In this area, Beijing set up special, export-oriented economic zones, where industrial capitalism was encouraged to flourish.
Sponsor Message
""Local officials, earning fees from factory growth, were incentivized to work hand in glove with the Taiwanese entrepreneurs,"" McGee writes. ""They were empowered to subsidize land and machinery, to build infrastructure to aid logistics, and to facilitate the flow of migrant workers from China's rural areas.""
China had a very restrictive internal migration system that prevented their people from moving to new places without government authorization. It opened up that system to encourage migration into these special economic zones, allowing millions of desperately poor, rural residents to come and work. Foxconn built massive factory complexes that served as basically self-contained communities for these workers. It was a population willing to — or, given their political and economic circumstances, you might argue, forced to — toil on assembly lines for obscene hours and meager pay in a way that few Americans would probably accept. In fact, many Chinese workers couldn't tolerate these working conditions. Over the years, Foxconn factories saw suicides and other horrors. At one point, Foxconn installed nets around their factories to prevent people from killing themselves.
But McGee stresses that the attractiveness of China was about more than just cheap or exploited labor. It was also the sheer number of workers and the willingness of government officials and private contract manufacturers like Foxconn to basically bend over backwards in an effort to make Chinese factories succeed and keep their foreign clients happy. Apple, with its cutting-edge designs and perfectionism, was a pretty fussy and demanding client.
In 2000, when Apple's relationship with Foxconn intensified, Steve Jobs actually still harbored ambitions to keep a lot of manufacturing in-house at Apple and in America, McGee writes. But Jobs' perspective began changing around the turn of the millennium. First, came the dotcom bust and a financial squeeze for tech companies. And, in 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, which, through various measures, helped make China an even more attractive place to do business.
Sponsor Message
Foxconn — and China — proved to be an incredible partner for Apple. ""Once Foxconn started to work on building the iMac at scale, Apple engineers were astonished at what became known as 'China speed' — an ability to get things done at a rapid pace beyond the comprehension of Western visitors,"" writes McGee.
Foxconn's strategy, McGee argues, was to offer the Cupertino-headquartered company dirt-cheap, high-quality factory work in exchange for learning from the best in the business. ""Foxconn might not win much profit from Apple — it might even lose money at times — but the work itself, as well as the lessons Cupertino offered by having its engineers work side by side with locals in the factories, gave his team a deep education,"" McGee writes. ""Foxconn's goal was to absorb these lessons and apply the skills to its other, more lucrative clients.""
In the years to come, Foxconn proved indispensable in making Apple products. When Apple released the iPod mini, one of its most successful products ever, Foxconn — and an army of Chinese workers — went above and beyond in proving their capabilities to deliver huge volumes of high-quality gadgets at low cost. ""The experience fundamentally reshaped Steve Jobs's perception of what was possible from a manufacturing perspective,"" McGee writes. ""In 2000, he'd clamored for Apple's own factories to take on more production. But by 2005, Jobs grasped that there was no going back.""
Within a decade of the call between Tim Cook and Terry Gou, there was a dramatic transformation in how and where Apple made things. ""In 1999, none of Apple's products were made in mainland China; by 2009, virtually all were,"" McGee writes. He argues it was less globalization, and more ""Chinafication.""
The Legacy of Apple In China
Reading
Apple in China
, it's hard not to wonder whether Apple, in its pursuit of profit, may have inadvertently helped usher in a new world order helmed by one of America's biggest adversaries.

McGee offers some stunning facts and figures in his book about the role that Apple played in developing China's industrial base.
""Not a single manufacturing site bore the Apple name or displayed a bitten fruit outside, yet by 2012 the value of Apple-owned machinery in the country had soared to $7.3 billion — more than Apple's US buildings and retail stores put together,"" McGee writes.
""Internal documents obtained for this book reveal that Apple's investments in China reached $55 billion
per year
by 2015, an astronomical figure that doesn't include the costs of components in Apple hardware.""
But money may not have even been Apple's most valuable investment in China. It may have been teaching a massive workforce how to do advanced manufacturing. ""Apple itself estimates that since 2008 it has trained at least 28 million workers — more people than the entire labor force of California,"" McGee writes.
McGee details how Apple, obsessed with maintaining their quality standards, would literally send planeloads of their engineers and others to China to teach Chinese workers and executives how to properly make cutting-edge computers and electronic devices. Apple sent ""so many engineers to China on temporary trips,"" McGee writes, that the company ""convinced United Airlines to begin direct flights from San Francisco to Chengdu, three times a week, arguing that Apple would regularly buy enough of the thirty-six first-class seats to make it profitable. The 6,857-mile flight became United's longest nonstop flight.""
Apple in China
is the story of a dramatic transformation — of Chinese industrialists and workers learning from the best in the business, helping them to jump from low-end manufacturing to making cutting-edge tech.
""This rapid consolidation reflects a transfer of technology and knowhow so consequential as to constitute a geopolitical event, like the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" McGee argues.
But, really, it's less like the fall of the Berlin Wall, which ushered in greater freedom and democracy. It's more like if Corporate America had supercharged the economy of the Soviet Union.

China learned to emulate the Apple model with other American companies. For example, China enticed Tesla into building cars there and then took the learnings and quickly applied them to their own homegrown EV industry, which is now outcompeting Tesla.
As we said at the top, how you see all of this is largely political. When it comes to raw economics, there's not really any question that Apple's arrangements in China created a lot of wealth, innovations, and cheaper, more abundant electronic devices that consumers around the world love.
When Apple first began pursuing this strategy, the American political world was much different. At the turn of the millennium, leaders in both political parties were all about opening up China with the hope it would produce a better world, a better economy, and a better, more democratic China.
Around 2013, that began changing. China, under Xi Jinping, took a more authoritarian and nationalist turn. Meanwhile, the evidence of the downsides of free trade for U.S. workers had become more apparent. The election of Donald Trump in 2016 was a major turning point. And Apple has been in an uncomfortable position ever since. McGee paints the company as basically hooked on Chinese production and that there's no easy way to get the monkey off its back, even when politicians are screaming they better soon.
There are many questions over the future of Apple in China. Can it drop China, or, at least, diversify away from China, and make iPhones in America, or, more realistically, a country like India or Mexico? McGee suggests that it is much harder than it may seem. And it's not just because China has over a billion people and an authoritarian government with dictatorial powers over industries and workers. The supply chains they've developed are astounding. They now have a massive, skilled manufacturing workforce as well as a massive, poor population that has proven willing to migrate to industrial clusters. Beijing has been able to turn on this flow of labor like a faucet when and where needed. China's machines, robots, factories, and knowhow make their workers incredibly productive. Meanwhile, China's homegrown companies — having learned from companies like Apple and Tesla — are increasingly competing with Western companies on things like design and the development of tech.

Postscript: What
Apple In China
may teach us about the importance of manufacturing
We've been doing a manufacturing series in the
Planet Money
newsletter, looking for evidence for why this sector may be special. It gets a lot of attention in our politics.
In the course of reporting this series, we've encountered many manufacturing boosters who stress that domestic manufacturing is important for America for at least two big reasons beyond the ones we've already covered: national security and innovation.
Apple in China
adds evidence on both points.
First, national security. Even diehard free-market economists tend to believe that nations need capabilities to physically make things in order to defend themselves in wars or national emergencies like a pandemic. That has historically meant preserving the nation's ability to make tanks, planes, guns, bombs, and so on. Even if it's cheaper and more efficient economically to make these things abroad, the importance of having these production capabilities in America makes a lot of sense for national security reasons.
Apple in China
raises the specter that the dramatic offshoring of tech manufacturing, even if it's just smartphones, earbuds, and computers, may also threaten American security interests. As McGee makes pretty clear, the offshoring of manufacturing overseas helped China make leaps in economic development and become more innovative as a nation. It suggests that there are profound spillover effects from having a large manufacturing base.
Some argue, often quite convincingly, that the mass offshoring of manufacturing has atrophied America's ability to innovate in making physical stuff, as opposed to software and other services. We may now not have enough skilled manufacturing workers, or workers willing to work in manufacturing at the wages companies are paying. We may not have enough robots and advanced machines to make stuff efficiently. Our supply chains pale in comparison to China's. And some fear factors like these make America less competitive when it comes to developing the next wave of cutting-edge industries, in areas like robotics, clean-energy technologies, aerospace, and drones. These areas could be generators of lots of good jobs for Americans, and they could also be important for national security.

If you're on the first flight out, there's little chance you'll have to wait for that aircraft coming in from another city because it's likely been sitting at the airport overnight.
Don't let yourself get stranded. Keep moving.
If your airline can't quickly rebook you, look for creative ways to get to your final destination. Buy a one-way ticket on another airline (ask for reimbursement later), skip the flight altogether and take a train or bus, or fly into a nearby city and drive the rest of the way.
""Don't just be stuck,"" Dong says. ""As long as you get to a destination that's closer to you, you're better off. Figure it out when you get there.""
Book direct.
Beware of using a third party to book your flights. I bought my family's Hawaii tickets on a third-party site, and when my rebooked Hawaii flight was re-canceled, the third-party site wouldn't help me. What's more, the airline didn't even know the third-party site had told me I was rebooked (because apparently I never was).
""Book direct, always,"" Dong says, to set yourself up for success and assistance in case of delays or cancellations. ""In terms of pricing, there usually shouldn't be a difference.""
If you want refunds or flight credits, be nice to your customer service rep.
Your best bet to get a refund from the airline is to do some serious sweet talking, says Eulanda Osagiede,  director of operations at Black Travel Alliance and chief operations officer at Black Travel Summit.

If you originally booked a refundable ticket directly with your airline, getting your money back should be  no problem. But if, like me, you didn't (oops), your best bet to get that refund is some serious sweet-talking, Osagiede says.
Osagiede says she's gotten flight credits on canceled, non-refundable, zero-flight-credit trips just by being ""very nice, very friendly"" with the customer service representative on the phone. So
don't
start yelling at them. Treating reps like the human beings they are can make all the difference.

Avoid non-refundable tickets.
And speaking of non-refundable tickets, avoid them if you can, Osagiede says. Yes, they are cheaper, but they are a risk. They do ""not offer refunds or rescheduling, so you're rolling the dice.""

As for me, I did eventually get my money back — but not without weeks of emails, phone calls and frustration.

If nothing else, getting stranded taught me that what's worse than a canceled flight is not knowing what to do next.

The non-lethal bullet did not injure the veteran freelance photographer, thanks to that protection.
""It felt very very intentional,"" Nigro tells NPR of the incident at a rally against ICE raids last week, ""a chilling effect to convince us to go away and not document what's occurring.""
Press advocates say such episodes have been common at the

On Monday, the Los Angeles Press Club and the investigative reporting  site Status Coup filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles and the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department in federal court, alleging that officers at the demonstrations are routinely violating journalists' rights.
""Being a journalist in Los Angeles is now a dangerous profession,"" states the complaint, filed in the Western Division of the Central District of California. ""LAPD unlawfully used force and the threat of force against Plaintiffs, their members and other journalists to intimidate them and interfere with their constitutional right to document public events as the press.""
The messy protests that have unfolded in real time on cable television and social media carry a strong sense of theatricality but also the threat of violence — from both sides. In some instances, protesters have attacked and burned cars.
And at times, journalists have reported law enforcement exacerbated rather than simply encountered tensions with protesters — an assessment that contradicts official statements.

It's been a long day and a long week ... I think there has been respect between the media and law enforcement here. We have kept our distance.""
LAPD has not returned NPR's detailed requests for comment. Nor has the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.
L.A. Police Chief Jim McDonnell said the
No Kings protests
Saturday, which have built on the momentum of the anti-ICE demonstrations of recent days, started peacefully in Los Angeles.

""It went well until police officers started being attacked — the LAPD, the LASD and the [California Highway Patrol],""
McDonnell told a reporter
from local station KNBC. Protesters have said confrontational law enforcement officials changed the tenor of the encounters.
Even prior to the No Kings events, protests over President Trump's immigration policies popped up in cities across the country as ICE agents have seized and detained people suspected of being in the country without full legal status — many of whom have no criminal record and face no criminal charges.

In Los Angeles, Trump took the unusual step of nationalizing units of the California National Guard and also sent in U.S. Marines over the objections of Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor.
The state of
California is suing
the administration over the move, alleging the president is unlawfully using those troops ""for law enforcement purposes on the streets of a civilian city.""
Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act to do so. The last time U.S. troops were sent to handle protests and riots was 1992 — also in Los Angeles, when violent riots broke out over the acquittal of police officers charged with beating Rodney King. More than 60 people died in those riots. These protests have not matched that scale or ferocity.
Politics
Trump's immigration response poses political risks
Despite the controversy over the presence of federal troops, almost all of the incidents cited by press rights advocates have involved Los Angeles law enforcement.
History of tensions between police and journalists
""This isn't new here.
History repeats itself
,"" says Adam Rose, press rights chair of the press club. ""The LAPD — and often the L.A. Sheriff's Department as well — arrest and attack journalists. They will arrest them. They will detain them. And they will cause serious injury as well with these 'less-lethal' munitions.""
Decades ago,
the LAPD police and the LA press maintained a cozy relationship
. But that turned sour.
In 2021, the LAPD swept a major city park of a homeless encampment, as NPR has
previously reported.
Police detained at least 16 journalists in a single night. Two reporters and an independent news blogger were arrested and held at a police station for hours. Two other reporters were zip-tied at the scene. Officers shot two photojournalists with ""less-lethal"" rubber bullets.
Capt. Stacy Spell, at that time the chief LAPD spokesman, later told NPR that it was often hard for police officers to figure out whether someone was a journalist or not.

""Once upon a time there was a very traditional look as to what the media looked like,""
Spell said
. ""And now there are more independents and more people who post on social media or online or use some form of technology to express their views or their points or their stories."" He said the priority was to keep the public safe.
Over three dozen incidents tallied
Freelance visual journalist Michael Nigro, shown here at protests in Los Angeles' Koreatown neighborhood shortly after being struck in the helmet by a non-lethal bullet fired by a Los Angeles Police Department officer. His helmet bears a bright mark where the projectile hit him. Given he wears several labels marked ""press,"" Nigro says it felt like an effort to intimidate him from covering the protests.

In 2022, in part as a result of that incident, California legislators revised state law to specify that journalists have the right to be in public spaces during upheaval — even if others must disburse or follow a curfew.
Rose was part of an intense effort to secure those changes. At his initiative, the press club is once more compiling a database about incidents involving journalists and law enforcement in L.A. It has compiled more than three dozen such instances it says it has verified that have occurred since the protests over the ICE raids began in Los Angeles earlier this month.
""In order to have an informed public, we must have a free press,"" Rose says. ""When journalists can't tell that story — and can't tell that story safely — that prevents the story from being told. That right has been deprived, not just for the journalists, but for the public at large.""
The incidents have gained national attention. On Friday, a coalition led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent a letter of protest to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who until last fall was a Fox News host, and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as the Los Angeles police chief and the Los Angeles County sheriff.
""While we also recognize the important role of law enforcement to protect public safety and crowd control, the right and ability of the press to document law enforcement and other government activity safely and effectively is foundational to self-government and has long been recognized and protected by the courts,"" the letter stated. It was signed by 60 news organizations and press rights groups, including NPR.

Consider a selection of the episodes that the press club has compiled, including some that were captured live in the moment by the journalists themselves:
An Australian television correspondent was shot by a law enforcement officer with a rubber bullet
during a live shot
as she stood to the side of protests in downtown Los Angeles. The officer taking aim could be seen in the background as it happened.
A photographer for the
New York Post
was struck in the forehead by another rubber bullet, his
stunning
image capturing its path immediately before impact. ""I just got shot in the head,"" the visual journalist, Toby Canham, exclaimed in real-time as his digital camera was rolling.
A veteran
Los Angeles Times
reporter, by his account, says he was
shoved by a Los Angeles Police Department officer
after reminding him that journalists were exempt, under state law, from the city's recently imposed curfew. Several of his colleagues
reported being struck by ""police projectiles
.""
A student journalist says LAPD officers shot him twice with rubber bullets. One nearly severed the tip of his pinky, which required surgical reattachment.
A freelance journalist
says he believes he was shot by a deputy
from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. A CT scan showed what appears to be a 40mm ""less lethal"" munition embedded in a two-inch hole in the reporter's leg.
A
New York Times
reporter was assessed
at a hospital
after being struck by another non-lethal round.
Journalists for CNN were led from areas of protest and conflict with hands behind their back — though police told them they were being detained, though not arrested. A Fox crew encountered a ""flash bang"" projectile near their vehicle — but said they thought it wasn't aimed at them.
CNN and Fox News have played down the seriousness of those episodes.
Sponsor Message
Other journalists say they believe they were targeted; in other instances, they allege little discretion was exercised between subduing protests that might get out of hand and repelling the press.
While rubber bullets are considered ""less lethal"" munitions, they can do harm. A peer-reviewed article published in 2017 in the medical journal
BMJ Open
found that
rubber and plastic bullets caused ""significant morbidity and mortality""
as well as significant injury in many of those who survived being hit. The study concluded that those non-lethal bullets ""do not appear to be appropriate weapons for use in crowd-control settings.""
""I was like, 'Okay, somebody has it out for me,'"" says Nigro, the veteran photographer.
He says he's covered violent protests and combat, including the war in Ukraine. He says his helmet and flak jacket are each marked ""press"" on both sides and that he carries two professional grade cameras clearly defining him as a working reporter to authorities.
""We are not up in their faces. We are not preventing them from doing their job,"" Nigro says. ""When you have professionals that are gauging a situation as volatile as that, and there are press around, a head shot like that at close range feels like it's intentional."""

What was it like to work inside Elon Musk's DOGE? The cost-cutting initiative promised transparency, but most of its actions have been shrouded in secrecy.
For months, there were reports of software engineers and Trump loyalists entering agencies and accessing sensitive data. DOGE also helped the Trump administration lay off thousands of government workers. NPR reporters have been trying for months to get anyone from DOGE to talk on the record. Now, Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE staffer assigned to the Department of Veteran Affairs, is speaking.
Today, what drew Sahil to DOGE and what he learned about the inner workings, in a way we've never heard before.

It's Been A Minute
host Brittany Luse is in dire need of a new couch.
""I can feel the frame through the padding – it's rough,"" she said. ""I'm not even inviting my friends over because I don't want them to sit on this couch. They deserve better than this!""
But she said every time she finds a nice enough couch online, she chokes when she gets to the checkout page.
""Typing in my credit card number for a $4,000 couch just doesn't feel right. It's just a big commitment,"" she said.
And every time she
almost
clicked ""buy,"" she kept noticing something. Right under the options for a credit card, Apple Pay and PayPal were options that'd let her buy the couch and break her payment down into four installments using Klarna, Affirm, or AfterPay. These companies offer ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) loans.
Sponsor Message
Business
Who actually pays with buy now, pay later companies like Klarna and Affirm
As the
It's Been a Minute
team dug into it more, we found out that BNPL is gaining popularity – over one in five people has used BNPL
according
to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and most of those users have not-great credit.
""I'd split the user base into two main categories of heavy 'buy now pay later' users: young people and people with poor or limited credit history,"" said NPR
Life Kit's
Andee Tagle
, who's reported on this topic. ""And the reason for that is because the barrier to entry is a lot lower for 'buy now, pay later' loans than your typical credit card or bank loan.""
But when the news broke that Klarna was partnering with DoorDash so customers could ""eat now, pay later,"" there was a lot of
concern
about the prospect of financing burritos. And after finding out from a LendingTree
survey
that 25% of BNPL users use the loans for everyday purchases like groceries, Brittany wondered about the risks of a necessity like food entering the BNPL universe.
Business
Examining the pros and cons of the option to buy now, but pay later
So she called up Malcolm Harris, author of
Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World
. He said that's actually not what this is about.
""It's about the delivery itself, not the food; it's that convenience,"" he said. ""We saw the same pattern of activity with hotels and Airbnb, for example, or with like cab companies and Uber and Lyft, for example, where you had big deep pocketed investors who are financing these companies at a loss in order to build up market position and a user base and change people's habits at a really fundamental way into this phone-mediated, always on convenience access.""
Sponsor Message
And after hearing the
news
that Klarna has doubled its losses in the most recent quarter, compared to a year earlier – due in part to people not paying back their BNPL loans – Brittany wanted to know: are BNPL companies banks, or are they tech companies? How should they be regulated, and how will consumers stay protected?
Well – that's still up in the air.
Harris said that originally, BNPL companies didn't have to abide by some of the regulations that most financial institutions do.
""They call it disruption, right? Disruption is the nice gloss that you put on regulatory arbitrage, because so many of these business models are about continuing a previously existing business model, but dodging the regulations,"" Harris said.
""So Uber is a great example because Uber, when it was first founded, was called UberCab. And when they discovered that would mean that they were subject to all of these regulations that the cab industry was subject to, their strategy was to chop the name 'Cab' off. If they'd been subject to all the industry regulations, they never could have gotten off the ground. Same thing is absolutely true with Airbnb, which is not a hotel service – hotels are heavily regulated. We shouldn't be surprised to see a regulatory arbitrage strategy from 'buy now, pay later.'""
But last year, the CFPB essentially
said
BNPL companies are credit card providers. That meant that these companies had to comply with the Truth in Lending Act of 1968. And now, another wrench has been thrown in after Trump came into office.
""They
issued
a new interpretation in May of 2025 saying, 'never mind about that other thing, we're not going to focus on 'buy now, pay later' providers, and in fact, we're looking at repealing that whole interpretation,'"" said Harris.
And in
the past
, if you did get behind on BNPL payments, it wasn't going to be reported to the credit bureaus. But as of the past few months, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are trying to change this. So potentially, consumers are approaching a situation with BNPL where if you get behind payments, you could potentially end up with bad credit. And now with changes at the CFPB – they might not have any protections, either.
Sponsor Message
But the rise of BNPL might also be related to what some have
called
the ""millennial lifestyle subsidy."" Some tech companies – like the ones Harris mentioned – were described using that phrase because for a long time, they offered services we already had with a newer, more convenient, and often cheaper model. But their prices have been
rising
for a while.
Here & Now
Adding up the real cost of buy now, pay later products for consumers
""I think Klarna and Affirm and any of these other 'buy now, pay later' companies are really inserting themselves as a solution to this problem of: how do you pay for the rising costs that come with Airbnb and come with Uber? And I think 'buy now, pay later' is a button you can click at the end to make it that much easier to afford those things,"" said Harris.
Harris said lifestyle subsidies are not new.
""We can look at the Boomer generation, for example, as heavily subsidized: by housing loan subsidies that provided a whole generation with cheap houses that they can own, and government programs of highway building, a whole road complex that they could drive on and enjoy. And we see the whole lifestyle that's built on that, right?"" Harris said.
""There was a whole generation that came to understand itself in relation to cars and the highway system, and that was heavily subsidized by the state decision to build that highway system. I don't think we're the Uber generation because we loved taking Ubers, we were the Uber generation because capitalists saw an advantage in investing tons and tons and tons of money in these cab services, and we absorbed that, and it changed our lifestyle.""
Who pays for lifestyle subsidies when the bill comes due? According to Harris, it's the consumers who are now reliant on formerly cheap services. BNPL services may help people afford them in the short-term, but more people are
having trouble
paying their BNPL loans back.
Sponsor Message
If we can't afford Uber or DoorDash as easily anymore – even with BNPL – that might require all of us to rethink the price of convenience (or push us to relearn how to hail a cab, or how to make our own burritos).
As for Brittany, she's going to a store to pick out her next couch – when she's ready to pay in full."

Oil prices jumped and stocks tumbled Friday following Israel's attack on Iran, which raised fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.
Crude oil prices saw their biggest increase since Russia's invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, pushing the U.S. benchmark close to $73 a barrel. If sustained, that could reverse
the downward slide
in gasoline prices, which has helped to keep inflation in check. The Labor Department said Wednesday that
gas prices had fallen 12%
in the last twelve months.
Stocks fell sharply Friday as investors weighed the potential fallout from the conflict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell close to 500 points, or 1.1% in the first two hours of trading.

This week, the Treasury Department reported that the federal deficit had topped $1.2 trillion, with four months still to go in the fiscal year."

HONG KONG — Markets in Asia opened lower early Friday while oil prices surged after
Israel attacked Iran's capital

That helped offset a 4.8% loss for Boeing after Air India said a London-bound flight crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad airport Thursday with 242 passengers and crew onboard. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a residential area near the airport five minutes after taking off. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known.
Stocks broadly got some help from easing Treasury yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Thursday's update said inflation at the wholesale level wasn't as bad last month as economists expected, and it followed a report on Wednesday saying something similar about the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.
Wall Street took it as a signal that the Federal Reserve will have more leeway to cut interest rates later this year in order to give the economy a boost.
Sponsor Message
The Federal Reserve has been hesitant to lower interest rates, and it's been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it's waiting to see how much President Donald Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation. While lower rates can goose the economy by encouraging businesses and households to borrow, they can also accelerate inflation.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35% from 4.41% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.
Besides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs across the country.
""We believe that were it not for the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, the combined information coming from the inflation and labor-market data would have compelled the Fed to have resumed cutting its policy rate by now,"" according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.
The Fed's next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it's likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.
Trump's on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20% below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.
Many of Trump's tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point ""saying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.""

Information is still emerging about the crash. Here are some key questions:
Who was on the plane?
Flight 171 took off with 242 passengers and crew on board, according to Air India.
The airline provided a breakdown of the passengers who were on the Boeing 787-8:
169 Indian nationals;
53 British nationals;
7 Portuguese nationals;
1 Canadian national
Air India has
set up two hotlines
for families and loved ones to call for information about passengers.
What type of Boeing jet was involved?
Flight 171 was a 787-8, registered as VT-ANB. The aircraft was manufactured in Seattle, Wash., and delivered to Air India on Jan. 28, 2014, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.
The 11-year-old jet had accumulated more than 41,000 hours of flying time, and almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, which is average for an aircraft of its age, according to Cirium.
Loading...
In the past week alone, the airliner had completed at least 11 international trips, with destinations ranging from Paris and Frankfurt to Melbourne and Tokyo, according to the tracking site
Flightradar 24
.
Departing early Thursday afternoon local time, Flight 171 used ""the full length of Runway 23 at Ahmedabad,"" having ""backtracked to the end of the runway before beginning its take off roll,""
Flightradar 24
said via Bluesky.
The Boeing 787-8 is the smallest and oldest version of the Dreamliner series, able to carry up to 248 passengers,
according to the aircraft maker
. The model's fuel efficiency and long range have made it popular with airlines. While the variants differ in length, all Dreamliners have the same wingspan of nearly 200 feet, Boeing says.
Boeing and Air India have a long-standing relationship, with the airline taking delivery of its first Boeing jet, a 707-437, in 1960, according to India's
Ministry of Civil Aviation
.
""We are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them,""
Boeing said
after the crash. ""Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.""
Sponsor Message
What happened to the airliner?
It's far too early to know what caused the devastating crash. But aviation experts say they're able to draw some information from watching footage of the plane's brief flight — and point to questions that investigators will likely explore.
Guzzetti says he sees several potential explanations.
""Perhaps the engines were not putting out the amount of power they needed to be putting out,"" Guzzetti said, ""although I don't see smoke or burping or flames coming from the engines. So it could be just a computer programming issue with the engines.""
Loading...
Some aviation experts also noted that the wing flaps on the Dreamliner did not appear to be extended. Those flaps are normally extended during takeoff to help increase lift and lower stall speed.
""They need to be extended a little bit before takeoff,"" Guzzetti said, ""But it might be just very, very difficult to discern that from the video.""
The National Transportation Safety Board
said Thursday morning via  X
that the agency will lead a team of U.S. investigators to assist in the crash investigation.
What about Boeing quality concerns?
There have been quality and safety concerns about the Dreamliner in the past — but none of the planes had ever crashed before.
Federal regulators grounded the entire 787 fleet worldwide for more than three months after
lithium ion batteries caught fire
on two of the aircraft in 2013, leading to smoldering fires in the cargo hold. Boeing had to craft a workaround and created a metal box to surround the batteries to prevent fires from spreading.
Business
FAA is investigating Boeing for apparent missed inspections on 787 Dreamliner
There have also been concerns about the plane's carbon fiber fuselage. Last year, a whistleblower
said he had observed problems
with how parts of the plane were fastened together. The longtime Boeing engineer warned that production ""shortcuts"" could significantly shorten the lifespan of the plane, eventually causing the fuselage to fall apart in mid-flight.
But Boeing pushed back on those allegations. Engineering executives at the company
defended the integrity of the 787's fuselage
, saying they had conducted extensive testing with no findings of fatigue in the composite fuselage.

Between January and May, the number of claims was nearly 18% higher than during the same period last year.

""The question I have is, are these largely people who were planning to retire like six months from now, who have accelerated by a short period of time?"" Smalligan says. ""Or are they people who are making a much more fundamental shift in their retirement plans, in terms of claiming years earlier than they had been planning?""
Social Security is financed through
a payroll tax
. During your working years, you and your employer pay into the system. When you retire, your benefits are based on how much you (
or your spouse
) paid in and your age. The earliest anyone can claim benefits is age 62, and full retirement is
between age 66 and 67
. Once you reach age 70, the monthly benefit stops increasing, even if you further delay taking it.

So what accounts for the uptick in claims? There are several factors at play.
In a statement to NPR, the Social Security Administration wrote that it had identified ""three key reasons"" that people are filing claims now: a peak of retiring Baby Boomers;
a rule change
that increases Social Security benefits for some people with pensions; and a bump in people who had been collecting spousal benefits re-filing to claim a higher benefit based on their own records.
But there appears to be another big factor among those in their 60s: worries about their economic future under the Trump administration.
'We better get it while we can'
A slide from a now-deleted
agency operational report in late April
showed significant year-over-year increases in claims by 62-year-olds — the earliest age you can file.
Bill Armstrong is one of them. He lives in Berthoud, Colo., and says he ""recently decided it was in my best interest to retire.""
His career was in IT, testing software. In recent years he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, was laid off from his tech job, and then weathered the ups and downs of government contract work. By last fall, he was applying for jobs, with no luck.

The November election result spurred Armstrong to consider filing for early Social Security benefits, he says. He worried about the direction of the economy, and his inability to get a job as the federal government cuts staffing and jobs in the private sector get harder to find. And he worried that the government would raise Social Security's minimum retirement age.
""With the election and the impetus of
Project 2025
, I thought my career might be over as I know it,"" he says. ""I'm battling cancer, I'm married with a spouse, I'm single income. And I decided I better get in the system before they move that age higher.""
National
How tax cuts on Social Security benefits would impact the program's longevity
The last time Congress shifted the retirement age was in 1983, when full retirement was raised from 65 to 67, a change that was
phased in over decades
.
And although Social Security payments are called ""entitlements,"" Armstrong notes that they are earned.
""We all paid into those things. In my case, 42 years now,"" he says.
President Trump has said he won't touch Social Security. But that's not putting everyone's mind at ease. Armstrong says he knows plenty of other people making the same decision he did.
""We feel like that may be taken away from us, so we better get it while we can,"" Armstrong says.
The former head of the Social Security Administration acknowledged those worries in a late March meeting that
was posted on YouTube
but later removed.
In the video, Leland Dudek, who was then the agency's acting commissioner, says to another official, ""So what you're telling me is that [the pension rule change] put a strain on us being able to process claims. We have normal seasonal highs that are in that mix as well. And that fear mongering has driven people to claim benefits earlier, because they're afraid they're not going to claim benefits at all.""
Sponsor Message
""Yes, you're exactly right,"" the official replies.
'I'll just put it in the bank'
Karen Mccahey, 66, moved up her timeline once Trump took office.
""I was originally not going to claim until I was like 70. That was my goal. Because then when you claim it at 70, you get, of course, more money,"" she says. But Mccahey, who lives in suburban Chicago, no longer wants to wait that long.

Some of her calculus is rooted in her fears of the Trump administration. She worries about how the administration would respond to another pandemic, and that potential cuts to Medicaid will make it harder than it already is to see a doctor. She used to anticipate living into her 80s, but not anymore.
""I know several people who died during the pandemic,"" she says. ""Plus I know people who are dying left and right of cancer, you know, around my age.""
So she figures she might as well get her benefits now: ""I really don't need the money, but I'll just put it in the bank.""
But Mccahey knows that choice has financial repercussions: Her benefit will be lower for the rest of her life. And while Social Security benefits rise with inflation, money kept elsewhere may not.
Mccahey says her financial advisor always tells his clients to wait until age 70 to file. ""And I agree with him,"" she says. ""But not now.""
'A very consequential decision'
The analysis in late April by Social Security Administration staff found that the uptick in claims was especially pronounced among high-earning 62-year olds.
That's likely because high earners can generally afford to put off claiming until later, when their benefit is higher. So an uptick in claims from this group could indicate that something other than financial need is behind their decision to claim now.
Sponsor Message
This decision can be even more important for women, who have a longer life expectancy than men.
For each year that you wait, your monthly benefit
grows by 8%
, notes Kathleen Romig, who directs Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
""So it's a very consequential decision. It can mean hundreds of dollars every month and many thousands of dollars over your lifetime,"" Romig says.
Smalligan says there have been very few proposals to raise the early retirement age — and changes like that would be a big deal.
""That would be years in the making before that happens,"" he says. ""I would not be advising people to act now on the basis of that fear. If Congress was to do something like that, they basically always build in a lot of lead time. So a change like that would not be made effective immediately, it would be made effective in five or 10 years from now.""
Romig says that she understands why people are anxious. Yes, there are long-term questions about sustaining the current level of benefits. But Social Security won't just go away, she says.
""It's in the law and only an act of Congress can change that,"" says Romig. ""And Congress would be foolish to try to take Social Security away at this point, when it's so important in the fabric of American society.""
And, she says, ""as long as people are paying into Social Security, then the benefits will be paid out. That's how it works.""
Smalligan says while Congress needs to address the long-term funding of Social Security, ""there's no reason to think that people's benefits are at risk.""
""I don't think people should be claiming early because they think Social Security's going to go away,"" he adds. ""It's a very popular program for beneficiaries, as well as for Congress.""

One thing to note: If you do decide to file to receive benefits earlier than planned, and later regret it,
you can withdraw your claim in the first 12 months
after approval.
You'll have to
pay all the money back

The House of Representatives
narrowly approved legislation Thursday to eliminate the next two years of federal funding for public media outlets.
It did so at the direct request of President Trump, who has accused NPR and PBS of bias against conservative viewpoints as part of his broader attacks on the mainstream media.
The measure passed largely along party lines,
214 to 212
, with two key Republican lawmakers switching their votes from ""no"" to ""yes"" to push it over the finish line.
The
legislation
is the first request by the Trump administration for Congress to claw back money it already has approved through annual spending bills. The bill reflects a list of cuts totaling $9.4 billion that were requested by the Office of Management and Budget. The bulk of the cuts — $8.3 billion — are to foreign aid programs addressing global public health, international disaster assistance and hunger relief.
Sponsor Message
The remainder would
slash $1.1 billion
allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which distributes nearly all of the funds to local television and radio stations, for the next two fiscal years.  By law, that money is supposed to be approved in advance as part of an effort to insulate public broadcasting from political influence over fleeting issues. That spending had been approved by both Republican-led chambers of Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this year.
CPB, which is privately incorporated in Washington, D.C.,
is suing the Trump administration
over his efforts to exert control over its board. CPB, PBS and NPR put out separate statements decrying the vote. Executives from the two networks urged the Senate to put a stop to the legislation.
""Americans who rely on local, independent stations serving communities across America, especially in rural and underserved regions, will suffer the immediate consequences of this vote,"" NPR Chief Executive and President Katherine Maher said in a statement. ""If rescission passes and local stations go dark, millions of Americans will no longer have access to locally owned, independent, nonprofit media and will bear the risk of living in a news desert, missing their emergency alerts, and hearing silence where classical, jazz and local artists currently play.""
Sponsor Message
Similarly, Paula Kerger, PBS's chief executive and president, said the fight to protect funding for public media does not end with Thursday's vote. She said the services provided by public television ""cannot be replaced by commercial media.""
""If these cuts are finalized by the Senate, it will have a devastating impact on PBS and local member stations, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets,"" Kerger said. ""Without PBS and local member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.""
A coalition of local public media officers, emergency readiness officials, Native American tribal representatives, educators and others had joined with listeners and viewers to lobby lawmakers against the bill.
Support for public media has, historically, been fairly bipartisan. But the idea of getting government out of the business of subsidizing public media has always struck a chord in more conservatives parts of the Republican party, and it has been increasingly resonant in recent years.
The Republican majority prevailed on Thursday with a paper-thin margin, however, relying on the flipped votes of Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Nick LaLota of New York.
LaLota and Rep. Mike Lawler, both of whom represent the suburbs of New York City, have bucked party leadership over the separate issue of whether a new budget would return property tax deductions for pricey mortgages. LaLota could be seen on the floor conferring with House leaders just moments before reversing from ""no"" to ""yes.""  Lawler's vote was among the last cast.
Heated partisan debate before the vote
When House Majority Leader Steve Scalise formally introduced the legislation last week, he said it ""codifies President Trump's cuts to wasteful foreign aid initiatives within the State Department and USAID, as well as woke public broadcasting, including NPR and PBS, at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is a business the federal government shouldn't even be in.""
Sponsor Message
Republicans attacked the programs they targeted for cuts in speeches Thursday before the vote. ""Don't spend money on stupid things and don't subsidize biased media,"" Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said.
Democrats defended public broadcasting as providing essential services. They cited the need for local information during natural disasters and balanced news coverage.
""NPR and PBS are targeted here today precisely because they are so good at delivering the truth,"" Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said. He pointed to Trump's social media attacks on the outlets, saying, ""Trump doesn't want a country of engaged, informed Americans. He prefers those who salute on command.""
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has accused Republicans of rubber stamping Trump's agenda despite their own misgivings, held up a doll of Elmo, the Sesame Street character, on the House floor.
""The letter of the day is 'C'. How appropriate because this bill is cruel, and it cuts children's programs all across the country,"" he said.
After the vote, Rep. Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who is co-chair of a bipartisan caucus supporting public broadcasting, condemned the outcome.
""Before we trigger major consequences for our local public broadcasting stations throughout the West and other rural areas, we need more discussion—rather than railroading folks over the East Coast's editorials and indiscretions,"" Amodei said in a statement. ""I agree we must make meaningful cuts to shrink our federal deficit; however, I would be doing a disservice to the thousands of rural constituents in my district if I did not fight to keep their access to the rest of the world and news on the air.""
While a handful of Congressional Republicans have joined Amodei in supporting their local public radio and television stations, there is intense pressure on them to side with the president. Heritage Action, a grassroots conservative group, designated the vote on the rescissions bill as the first ""key vote"" included on their scorecard tracking lawmakers' voting records this session of Congress.
Sponsor Message
Some of Trump's supporters have been frustrated that Congress has not moved sooner to officially back the cuts recommended or put into motion already by the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, launched by Elon Musk. Musk initially vowed to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, then scaled back to $1 trillion. The
actual amount
so far has been a small fraction of the trillion promised. But Musk's imprint slimming down or gutting some federal agencies has already reverberated in fallout in the U.S. and around the world.
Musk's recent departure from the administration and public feud with the president haven't affected the plans of top GOP leaders on Capitol Hill to schedule votes to formally wipe out spending for the targeted agencies and programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he expected additional votes on rescissions requests based on DOGE's efforts.
After the heads of both NPR and PBS testified before a House oversight panel in March, the speaker argued in a statement on social media that NPR and PBS ""have consistently and knowingly betrayed the public trust. Instead of fair and balanced reporting, they routinely ignore facts to advance a far left agenda.""
""The American people support the free press, but will not be forced to fund a biased political outlet with taxpayer funds,"" Johnson said.
Conservative views on public media have changed
Two former Republican lawmakers say that the GOP sentiment toward public broadcasting has shifted over time — from frequent support to skepticism to open hostility.
""I always supported PBS on the rationale that 'just because Barnes and Nobles sold books didn't mean public libraries were no longer needed',"" former Oregon Sen. Gordon Smith, who served from 1997 to 2009, tells NPR. ""But even in those days, I would admonish my friends in PBS to strive for better political balance. This, they haven't done.""
Sponsor Message
Smith says he gave the same advice after later becoming chief of the National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group to which PBS and NPR do not belong. ""Given the size of the public debt and PBS's ability to find other financing and sell advertising, well, they've left themselves vulnerable,"" Smith says.
Former U.S. Rep. Charles Bass came to office with former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich's big Republican wave. Bass went on to represent New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District for 14 years.
""The debate over whether to fund public television or public radio networks is more divisive than it was,"" Bass says. ""By that process, it is likely to be more imperiled.""
""To some extent it's influenced by the perception that it's more liberal than it actually is,"" Bass says. ""There is a bent to it, but it's not as significant as the commercial networks — Fox and MSNBC on either end and CNN in the middle. They really are.""
Bass says public broadcasting stands apart for avoiding commercial priorities. But, he says, technological changes in how people consume media have raised valid questions about the need for federal subsidies.
He says that the shift in formats from music to all news and public affairs talk by many NPR member stations increased content that has proved controversial and attracted scrutiny by critics, especially on the right.
Yet he also says the lines have hardened within Republican ranks toward public broadcasting as cultural warfare has become increasingly important to the party faithful: first with Gingrich, then with the Tea Party, and now MAGA Republicans with Trump at the lead, each of which have sought to present public media as unworthy of taxpayer dollars.
""I would be pondering this seriously. I wouldn't be a lock-step supporter or opponent of public radio or television funding,"" Bass says. ""That's true even though I probably listen to [New Hampshire Public Radio] as a news source more than any other source of news.""

A bumpy history of public media funding
Congress created CPB, a private nonprofit entity, in 1967. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law making CPB the entity to oversee federal grants to more than 300 public television stations and more than 1,000 public radio stations.
In the early years, there were questions about the federal role for CPB. In 1969, Fred Rogers, the host of the popular children's show ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,""
testified
about the benefit of continued federal funding. His defense of CPB was credited with changing the mind of a key senator, John Pastore, a Rhode Island Democrat who had pressed Rogers on the value of public television.
Rogers described themes in his half-hour program addressing children's feelings and offering ways to handle them. He told the congressional panel, ""I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable we will have done a great service for mental health.""
Lawmakers from both parties frequently appear on their local public stations for interviews. They participate in debates hosted by local stations during House and Senate campaigns.
But for decades, Republicans in Congress have vowed to defund public media outlets. In 1994, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich
argued
for zeroing out CPB's budget. That didn't advance, but in more recent years Republicans have included provisions in annual spending bills to strip all federal money for NPR and PBS. But these have failed to be included in final versions of government funding bills enacted by presidents of both parties.
In 2011, the GOP-controlled House
approved a bill
to bar NPR from receiving any additional federal funding, but that measure failed to advance in the Senate. Seven House Republicans
voted against
that bill, including then-Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy, who now serves as Trump's transportation secretary.
More recently during years of divided government, GOP leaders had to rely on Democrats to approve must-pass funding bills to avoid shutdowns. The debate over the issue of federal funding for public media became more of a backburner issue. CPB received $535 million for 2025. The spending bill approved with bipartisan votes in the House and Senate and signed by Trump in March approved the same level for the next two years.
Sponsor Message
Just two months later, Trump
issued an executive order
to block funding for NPR and PBS. And this first effort by the Office of Management and Budget to ask Congress to rescind federal money lumped in public media with foreign aid — two areas the GOP base frequently holds up as priorities Washington needs to scale back or eliminate altogether.
Concern for rural areas
Earlier in the week, Amodei and Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York released a joint statement urging the Trump administration to ""reconsider"" clawing back money for CPB.
The two pro-public broadcasting lawmakers touted public media's news coverage and its role in communicating during emergencies, and pointed out that rural areas are ""particularly vulnerable"" if funding is cut.
""Public broadcasting represents less than 0.01% of the federal budget, yet its impact reaches every congressional district,"" the two noted. ""Cutting this funding will not meaningfully reduce the deficit, but it will dismantle a trusted source of information for millions of Americans.""
Goldman told NPR that Trump's role in pushing this issue is ""100%"" making this a tough vote for GOP lawmakers to break with the president. ""I think if they looked at the merits of it they would recognize it's essential funding — and public media, independent journalism plays an essential role,"" Goldman said.
He argued that Trump objects because ""independent media that exposes facts that may look unfavorable to him is therefore somehow biased, but the First Amendment protects freedom of the press specifically because the press is an essential form of accountability in our democracy.""
Some Republicans have defended their own local public television and radio stations and expressed a willingness to work with Democrats to avoid cuts that would force them to scale back coverage or staffing.
Alabama GOP Rep. Robert Aderholt, pressed by Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse in a hearing on the bill on Tuesday, said Alabama Public Television ""has not been subject to these woke policies that some of these other states have,"" and suggested he could join a bipartisan effort to continue grants to local stations.
Sponsor Message
But Aderholt noted ""NPR is in a different category"" and said most GOP lawmakers have had concerns about the outlet for some time.
Even so, most of the cuts will fall on the local stations, which receive by far the lion's share of the funds. Some of that money makes it back to PBS and NPR in the form of fees to run the networks' programs on the air.
Public television and radio stations have mounted a grassroots lobbying effort to urge lawmakers to oppose the package. The Protect My Public Media campaign says more than 2 million messages have been sent to House and Senate offices. ""This support is driven by the deep connections Americans have to their local public media stations and the essential services stations provide to their communities.""
The rescissions package now moves to the Senate. Under the rules, it needs a simple majority to pass and must be approved within 45 days of the president sending the request to Capitol Hill. That means if the Senate — where Republicans also have a slim majority — fails to pass the bill by mid-July, the administration would be required to release the $9.4 billion in funding for the foreign aid programs and CPB. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated the Senate would take up the rescissions request soon.

Michele Santa Maria was 18 and a year out of high school when she landed a job at the Social Security Administration's field office in Chula Vista, Calif., in May 1990.
She started out answering phones and sorting mail. From there, she worked her way up to customer service, helping people resolve problems with their payments or get new cards. Later, she learned how to process all kinds of claims — retirement claims, survivor claims, family claims, disability claims.
Eventually, she became a claims technical expert, training others and working on complicated cases. She says the work was hard, and the antiquated computer systems added to the tedium.
Sponsor Message
""It's a thankless job sometimes, but we're going to stick it out because we believe in what we do,"" says Santa Maria. ""And yes, we want to get to that finish line.""
The finish line being retirement. The government's formula for retirement benefits is complicated, but typically, federal workers who have put in at least 30 years can retire at age 57 with their full pensions.
""It was the reason why I stayed so long,"" she says.
Politics
Trump's bill adds $2.4 trillion to deficit over 10 years, per nonpartisan analysis
But now, Congress looks to be chipping away at those benefits. A provision in the version of President Trump's
""Big, Beautiful Bill"" passed by the House
last month would cut deeply into the retirement income she's been counting on.
""It puts me in a really bad situation,"" says Santa Maria.
Staying for the benefits
Federal employees across the country perform complex, critical work that Americans depend on. The jobs are not the most exciting, nor the best paid. Still, many federal workers stay for decades, in part because of the government's retirement package, which far outpaces what most companies provide.
The Federal Employees Retirement System, known as FERS, is often described as a three-legged stool. It includes a pension, a Thrift Savings Plan akin to a 401(k) and — like nearly all U.S. workers — Social Security benefits.
Sponsor Message
In addition, those who retire before they're old enough to collect Social Security can receive a special retirement supplement between the ages of 57 and 62. It's a portion of what they'll be eligible to receive at 62, meant to be a financial bridge for those five years.
Law
Supreme Court grants DOGE access to confidential Social Security records
That supplement would disappear under the House-passed bill. Federal employees who are younger than 57 on Jan. 1, 2028 would be out of luck.
""I was in shock,"" says Santa Maria. ""I thought to myself, 'There's no way they're going to do this to us.'""
She retired because she feared she'd be laid off
Like so many federal workers, Santa Maria's career was thrown into upheaval after Trump took office.
She had not planned to retire until she turned 57. But fearing she'd be fired amid
Trump's massive government overhaul
, she took an early out.
As part of the downsizing, the Social Security Administration offered her a $20,000 voluntary separation incentive to retire at age 53. Her last day was April 19, just three weeks shy of her 35-year mark.
""Nobody knew anything. Management didn't know anything. Nobody really knew if your job was safe,"" she says. ""I thought, better just to take it voluntarily than being forced out.""
Michele Santa Maria received a pin from the Social Security Administration after working there for 30 years.

Only after she had made that irrevocable decision did she learn of the retirement supplement's impending demise. Now, if the Senate agrees to the cut, Santa Maria estimates she'll lose close to $110,000 over five years, money she was counting on to support her in retirement.
""I just can't understand why at the end of someone's career, they would take that away,"" she says.
""A pure windfall benefit""
Originally, the legislation moving through Congress included bigger cuts to the government's retirement benefits, including changing how retirement income is calculated. Instead of basing it on an employee's highest three consecutive years of pay, the earlier proposal would have changed that to the highest five. That was dropped before the bill went to a vote.
Sponsor Message
Earlier permutations of the bill also would have eliminated the special retirement supplement as early as this summer, before the date was pushed to 2028.
""What ended up getting passed was really watered down from the original version,"" says Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. She has long argued that federal retirement benefits are unnecessarily generous, far outstripping what most Americans get.
She was glad to see the House act on the special retirement supplement, calling it ""a pure windfall benefit.""
""It essentially gives them access to Social Security benefits long before every other American has access to Social Security benefits,"" she says.
Tens of thousands could lose out
John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), says it's hard to calculate how many people would lose retirement income under the House version of the bill. He estimates it could be in the tens of thousands.
""It impacts a lot of people,"" he says, including many like Santa Maria who are taking early outs now because of the threat of mass layoffs.
NARFE has strongly opposed cuts to federal benefits, calling the clawback of benefits earned from past work ""a real red line.""
Politics
Officially, 59,000 federal jobs are gone under Trump. There's more to the picture
""I find it analogous to if you had a 401(k), and your employer put in contributions toward the 401(k), and they vested it as part of that vesting schedule,"" says Hatton. ""Then after the fact, they start pulling back some of your 401(k) balance because they decided, 'I didn't really want to give you that much money.'""
The White House did not answer NPR's questions about the proposed cut or its impact on longtime federal employees.
An important retention tool or golden handcuffs?
Hatton argues that the retirement benefits serve as an important retention tool for the government. But Greszler says the perks may be keeping too many federal workers locked in.

""That might be a good thing if you're retaining the right workers, but it might not be a good thing if you're preventing people from pursuing something that they would be better at,"" she says, adding that churn in the workforce can be helpful.
Santa Maria disagrees. She says Americans need civil servants who can expertly navigate the government's complicated systems. And that expertise takes years to build.
""If people are going to come in for three to five years, the quality is just — it's not going to be there,"" she says.
Santa Maria says ""the government should keep its promise to us"" and not remove retirement benefits for longtime federal employees.

Santa Maria, who voted for Trump in the 2024 election, says she'd hoped that his

would bring technical expertise and upgrades to the Social Security Administration.
""But what they're doing now is just eliminating the people and leaving the rest with the outdated computer system,"" she says.
And now, with part of her retirement on the chopping block, she's even more disappointed.
Politics
How DOGE's push to amass data could hurt the reliability of future U.S. statistics
""I can understand new people — new hires. People who haven't spent a decade with the government. You can make changes at that point. People have the ability to adjust,"" she says. ""But when you have someone who's been there for 34 years and then just to pull the rug out from under you, that's devastating.""
She's shared her concerns with California's Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff but knows there's little they can do to stop the budget bill, given Democrats are in the minority on Capitol Hill. Under the reconciliation process Republicans are taking to get the measure passed, they need only a simple majority of votes.
Santa Maria also started a Change.org petition asking lawmakers to grandfather in those who, like her, made the decision to retire based on the promise they'd have the supplemental income at 57.

When President Trump announced his sweeping new tariffs this year, many trade law experts were startled. Typically, presidents don't have the authority to impose broad tariffs with a snap of their fingers.
But Trump's advisors have an unusual new legal theory. They say that as long as there's a national emergency of some kind, Trump may be able to create whatever tariffs he wants. This is a creative interpretation of a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. To justify his latest tariffs, the president declared national emergencies involving illegal immigration, the fentanyl crisis, and the trade deficit.
Sponsor Message
But no president has ever tried to use the law in this way.
Now, the fate of Trump's tariffs — and the creative legal theory behind them — lies with the courts. About a dozen lawsuits have challenged his tariffs, claiming that they are unlawful and possibly even unconstitutional. And some judges have started to agree.
On today's show: What are the President's powers when it comes to tariffs? Where do they come from? What are their limits? And, what will be the fate of Trump's tariffs?

Members of the Supreme Court press corps
released a public letter
Wednesday asking that the audio of the court's opinions and oral dissents be streamed online. The letter was originally sent to Chief Justice John Roberts privately one year ago, and has not received a response.
The signatories were representatives from all the major radio and TV networks as well as the newspaper and news agencies that cover the court, including NPR.
As it stands now, over the coming days as the U.S. Supreme Court announces a variety of highly significant decisions from the bench, only the lawyers, public attendees and members of the press corps who happen to be in the courtroom will hear directly from the justice of the opinion as he or she reads a summary of the decision.
Sponsor Message
The audio of that announcement will not be available until the next term begins in the fall, when it can be listened to at the National Archives or on
the Oyez website
.
The letter notes that the court began providing live audio of oral arguments in 2020 when the pandemic prevented the justices from hearing oral arguments together. Until then the court had resisted broadcasting oral arguments except in very rare cases, such as Bush v. Gore, the case that decided the 2000 election. But after the pandemic subsided and normal arguments resumed, the court continued the practice of live-streaming oral arguments — though continued to bar live streaming of opinion announcements.
The letter argues that while the justices would like people to read their opinions in their entirety for themselves, most people will not devote the hours needed to do that. It goes on to say that ""in this era of misinformation, providing live audio of opinion announcements would allow the Court to speak directly to the American people on issues of extraordinary importance.""
It concludes that ""just as the Court's live streaming of oral arguments has made your work accessible to a much wider audience, taking the next stop to allow the court's opinion announcements to be heard in real time will lead to greater understanding and appreciation of the court's final decisions."""

Trump tariff revenue soars 78%. Who's paying them?
Consumer prices in May were up 2.4% from a year ago, according to a report Wednesday from the Labor Department.  That's a slightly larger annual increase than the month before.
But prices rose just 0.1% between April and May — down from 0.2% the month before.  Falling gasoline prices helped to offset the rising cost of rent and groceries.
Trump's tariffs may have contributed to the rising price of some goods in May, such as appliances and toys. But overall goods prices held steady last month.  Forecasters expect the cost of tariffs to become more evident in the months to come.

The president has imposed an import tax of at least 10% on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries, and that tax rate could increase next month, at the conclusion of a 90-day window for trade negotiations.
Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that Trump's tariffs could reverse some of the progress that's been made on inflation over the last two years.
""We are already seeing the effects of higher tariffs, which I expect will continue to raise inflation over 2025,"" Kugler

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to
stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
Weeks after wildfires
burned more than 16,000 homes and buildings
around Los Angeles this winter, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered Congress a grim view of America's insurance markets.
Premiums across the U.S. have jumped 24% on average in the past few years,
according to the Consumer Federation of America
, in part because climate change is driving
more intense
storms, floods and wildfires. Insurers and banks have already retreated from some of the riskiest parts of the U.S., Powell told lawmakers, like coastal communities and areas prone to blazes, including parts of California.

""If you fast-forward 10 or 15 years,""
Powell said
, ""there are going to be regions of the country where you can't get a mortgage.""
Climate
How climate change could cause a home insurance meltdown
The consequences of that kind of meltdown would be profound. People
need insurance to get a mortgage
to buy a house. If people can't get mortgages, property values fall. That strains local governments, which depend on property taxes — linked to home values — to fund public services like police and firefighters. As insurers drop customers in high-risk areas, a lot of Americans have been pushed onto
expensive state-run plans with limited coverage
. That means homeowners who lose insurance often struggle after disasters to rebuild or move.
""Everything has a price,"" says Ben Keys, a real estate and finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And so, it's not that areas become uninhabitable. It's that it's so wildly unaffordable to find insurance that only the very wealthiest people could afford to live there — to bear those kinds of risks themselves.""
For insurers, the bill for disasters keeps growing. One way to lower the cost is for homeowners and communities to better protect themselves from storms and fires by investing in things like fortified roofs and by thinning forest vegetation. That kind of work has already started. However, insurers rarely consider what has been done to make a property more resilient when deciding to offer or renew coverage, says Dave Jones, California's former insurance commissioner and the director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at UC Berkeley Law.

""Insurance is the climate canary in the coal mine, and the canary is gasping for breath right now,"" Jones says. Investments that help communities endure more extreme weather are ""a path to keep insurance available,"" he says. ""But the insurers need to account for it in their modeling. They're not.""
Here's what you need to know about the state of America's shaky insurance markets and what's being done to try to fix them.

At its core, this is about the cost of disasters.

The amount of money insurers have paid out when extreme weather damages or destroys property has grown by between 5% and 7% annually in recent years,
according to Swiss Re
, a major reinsurer, which essentially sells insurance to insurance companies. If that trend holds, the industry will face close to $145 billion of insured losses globally in 2025, Swiss Re said in an April report. The Los Angeles wildfires alone inflicted around $40 billion of insured losses, the firm said.
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
Why knowing your neighbors can be an important climate solution
Disaster costs are rising for several reasons. People
continue to move
to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to forested areas prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. When homes get damaged or destroyed, inflation has made it more expensive to rebuild. All the while, the rising temperatures that fuel more extreme weather are caused primarily by burning fossil fuels that
insurance companies themselves continue to underwrite and invest in
.
Insurers have responded by increasing their prices to reflect the growing risks. That has raised insurance costs for homeowners and would-be homebuyers across the United States. In some places, including parts of California, Florida and North Carolina, insurers have gone further,
dropping customers
to shield themselves from ballooning losses.
Almost 2 million Americans had their home insurance policies dropped between 2018 and 2023, with the biggest impact in places at highest risk of disasters,
according to Keys
, of the University of Pennsylvania.
California Wildfires
Some Los Angeles homes made it through the firestorm. Here's how
""We have an insurance-availability challenge that we're facing in some states, as well as growing affordability concerns,"" says Karen Collins, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group.
Insurance experts, industry representatives and consumer advocates interviewed by NPR largely agree that to shore up insurance markets, homes and communities have to become more resilient. That means they have to be located and built to better survive the extreme weather being amped up by climate change. But there's deep disagreement about how that should happen.

Who's responsible for making homes and communities more resilient?
Consumer and industry advocates say everyone bears responsibility to make housing more resilient: homeowners and communities, insurers, and local, state and federal lawmakers. But getting the different players to agree and take action gets tricky.

on home insurance that everyone talks about protecting communities when disasters happen, but then the issue is forgotten until the next catastrophe.

Faced with rising temps, Las Vegas is embracing a simple climate solution: More trees
""We've got to stop talking about resiliency and then you go home, you get political pushback, you don't do it,"" Tillis said. ""We need local and state officials to have the courage to tell their communities what they need to do to be more resilient. And the federal government needs to reward those who will, and deny funding for those who don't.""
Alex Epstein, a fossil fuel advocate at the same hearing, offered a different view: Preparing for disasters should be the homeowner's responsibility. And insurers should charge whatever they think is appropriate. The idea, Epstein said, is that if premiums skyrocket, it signals to the public where it's safe to live and what people need to do to protect themselves.
""You just need to allow total freedom of insurance markets to act in response to risk,"" Epstein said.
But just letting insurers raise prices for something most Americans have to purchase for homeownership isn't a solution, says Douglas Heller, insurance director at the Consumer Federation of America.
""You can't require people to buy something and then make it impossible for them to afford it,"" Heller says.

As disaster costs and insurance premiums have risen, Heller says, a lot of homeowners and communities have tried to do their part by making their properties more resilient. The problem, he says, is that insurers do little to account for those efforts.

Among the places hardest hit by insurance market turmoil is Lake County, California. Located about 130 miles north of San Francisco, more than 5% of the area's housing stock has burned in wildfires in the past decade, Jessica Pyska, a county supervisor,
said at the May Senate hearing
on insurance markets. The loss of more than 2,000 homes has been especially devastating in a county where residents are
older and poorer
than the
national average
. Still, Lake County has managed to become ""a model for disaster mitigation and community preparedness,"" Pyska told lawmakers.

Homeowners have installed fire-resistant roofs and noncombustible siding. Pyska said vegetation has also been cleared to create what's called defensible space around homes and fuel breaks to protect critical infrastructure.
But despite those efforts, ""we continue to be crushed by the insurance crisis plaguing our nation,"" Pyska said at the hearing. Insurance options in Lake County keep dwindling — the area had one of the country's
highest rates of insurance nonrenewal
in 2023. And residents who can find coverage have seen premiums double or triple, she said. As a result, new housing development has stalled, and more homes sit vacant because buyers can't get insurance.
""We are doing as much as we can right now,"" Pyska said, ""and everything is on the line.""

Is anyone trying to help communities like Lake County?
That's exactly what a group of homeowners, insurance experts and environmentalists is trying to do in the forest of Northern California.
In the Sierra Nevada, a homeowners association called Tahoe Donner said this year that it had convinced an insurer to provide
coverage that accounts for the community's efforts to reduce threats from wildfires
, including by thinning trees and
conducting prescribed burns
.
""We convinced an insurer, based on our demonstration that forest management reduces risk, to write insurance in an area in the middle of the forest where other insurers are not writing,"" says Jones of UC Berkeley Law, who owns property in Tahoe Donner.

But it's just a first step. The policy covers only the association's forested and recreational land — not homes — and it's still ""incredibly challenging"" for residents there to get insurance, says Annie Rosenfeld, Tahoe Donner's general manager.
However, Rosenfeld says the policy should serve as a test case for the home insurance industry.
""For [insurers], they need to have some assurance that not only you've hardened your home, but the community has done that larger, broad-scale risk mitigation — [and] that we can quantify it,"" says Jason Hajduk-Dorworth, Tahoe Donner's director of administrative services and a former fire chief in Santa Cruz, California.

If insurers refuse to account for those kinds of initiatives, then Jones says state lawmakers should force the issue. He pointed to a law that Colorado Gov. Jared Polis
signed in May
requiring insurers that use risk models to consider actions that homeowners and communities take to protect themselves — including home hardening and forest management — when they assess the risk that a property will burn in a wildfire.

What do insurers say?
Collins, of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, disputes that insurers ignore investments that homeowners and communities are making to protect themselves.
Battered by surging costs, insurers have been regrouping, Collins says, limiting how much coverage they can provide in certain markets.
""It's not a matter of [investments in resilience] not being recognized,"" Collins says. ""It's a matter of each company is in a different place with what their capacity is to lean into the market.""
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
How climate change is reshaping life on the Mighty Mississippi
Once insurers are in a position again to grow their business in those areas, ""you better believe that they're going to be looking at what are the most attractive risks,"" Collins adds. ""And if your home has been mitigated and shows clearly that it has taken steps to reduce the likelihood or extent of damage, it is going to be more attractive.""
An industry-backed group working on resilience is the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. Michael Newman, the group's general counsel, told Congress that when homeowners make verifiable, science-based investments to reduce risk, ""insurers will pay attention.""
But that's not translating into action, says Jones, of UC Berkeley Law. ""The industry is well aware of the risk-reduction benefits of home hardening, defensible space and landscape-scale forest treatment,"" he says. ""What's frustrating is that so far, except for what we've done with this insurance product [at Tahoe Donner], it's not being accounted for.""
Sponsor Message
The question, then, is how to encourage more of those kinds of arrangements. Susan Crawford, a senior fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, doubts state legislation forcing the industry's hand will be effective.
Insurers have plenty of places to do business, Crawford says, and ""it may not be in their interest to spend money to differentiate among communities that have invested in particular ways.""
Ultimately, there would need to be a sort of grand bargain between the public and private sectors, she says. If states and localities strengthen building codes and land-use policies, for example, insurers could help obtain government grant funding to aid lower-income homeowners in making the necessary upgrades to their property. Then, Crawford says, insurers would be encouraged to offer more attractive coverage in that area.
So far, though, there haven't been enough incentives — or pressure — to hammer out that kind of deal. State and local officials face blowback when they call for measures that could make communities more resilient, because they often cost constituents money. Meanwhile, insurers don't think it's their job to push for building-code and land-use reform, Crawford says. And housing developers worry about changes that could drive up home prices and hurt demand.

Are there limits to how much communities and insurers can adapt to climate risks?
There are limits, according to Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz, a German financial company with a big insurance business. And those limits are approaching fast.
""The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay,"" Thallinger wrote in a
March LinkedIn post
that went viral in climate and insurance circles. As temperatures keep rising, ""adaptation itself becomes economically unviable.""
That leaves one option, Thallinger said: Reduce heat-trapping emissions by burning less fossil fuel or by capturing climate pollution before it's released into the atmosphere.

That same month, in an article
in the journal
Nature
about soaring insurance costs, Scott St. George, head of weather and climate research at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson, also concluded that drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential.
Insurers talk a lot about raising premiums so they can return to risky areas and operate profitably, ""and I feel like that overlooks the aspect of the problem that the issues will still be here next year and the year after that,"" St. George told NPR.
""I think we need to be up-front with ourselves and with the next generation,"" St. George said, ""that this is a very hard problem to solve without getting to the root of things.""

LONDON — Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a framework to get their trade negotiations back on track after a series of disputes that threatened to derail them, Chinese state media said Wednesday.
The announcement followed

Further details, including any plans for a potential next round of talks, were not immediately available.
Li and Wang Wentao, China's commerce minister, were part of the delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. They met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.
Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, said the disputes had frittered away 30 of the 90 days the two sides have to try to resolve their disputes.
They agreed in Geneva to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that sparked fears of recession. The World Bank, citing a rise in trade barriers, cut its projections Tuesday for U.S. and global economic growth this year.

Cutler said it would be unprecedented for the U.S. to negotiate on its export controls, which she described as an irritant that China has been raising for nearly 20 years.
""By doing so, the U.S. has opened a door for China to insist on adding export controls to future negotiating agendas,"" she said.

The popularity of recession indicators on social media is just the latest manifestation of a very old phenomenon. For generations, people have looked for small, informal signs that a recession is coming or already here. Here is a sample:

This theory was developed by an economist, George Taylor, during the Roaring 1920s (when skirt lengths tended to be short). ""The theory suggests that when the economy does well, hemlines creep up to match the feel-good vibe of the period, only to fall back down with recessions, reflecting the somber mood of empty bank accounts,"" writes

""During the 2008 recession, for example, cardboard-box manufacturers' operating revenues fell by more than 50%,"" wrote Michael Sincere
over at Marketplace

could also serve
as a recession indicator. If you see a bunch of empty parking lots, it could be a sign that consumers are cutting back spending and the economy is in a rough patch.

Recession-indicator mania: A reason to worry?
It's possible all the recent talk of recession indicators is an indicator a recession is coming.
After all, as the legendary economist
John Maynard Keynes theorized
, people's feelings or emotions about the state of the economy — their ""animal spirits"" — are
an important factor
behind the booms and busts of the economy. Those animal spirits influence spending and investing decisions, so if the mood gets bad, that could cause a recession. In other words, fear the vibe shift (
read this old
Planet Money
newsletter about economic theories of why recessions are even a thing
).
Since World War II, recessions have tended to happen about every six years, on average. The last one, during the COVID-19 pandemic, happened about five years ago …
Of course, we doubt whether any serious economist or forecaster is closely watching pizza sales or skirt lengths to make recession calls.
What they do really look at is at the heart of

Wall Street is getting
more and more worried
about the potential loss of America's superpower status. Now its CEOs are cycling from denial and bargaining to public anger and depression.
Since President Trump started unveiling his chaotic tariffs this spring,
sparking waves of panic
among global investors, the country's business leaders have been facing massive — and unrelenting — uncertainty.
The ongoing tariff tug-of-war is already
hiking prices for both consumers and businesses
, while
fraying
some of the country's international relationships. Meanwhile, executives and investors are also eyeing
the surging national deficit
, which
will be worsened
by the president's proposed budget. The massive bill has already passed the House and
is being considered by
the Senate.
Sponsor Message
Now many of the most powerful business leaders in America are warning that the country's global financial standing is at risk.
""We have to get our act together. We have to do it very quickly,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told the
Reagan National Economic Forum
last month.
Dimon said he's specifically worried about the power of the U.S. dollar — which has been the
world's dominant currency
since the end of World War II.
Almost 60%
of foreign-exchange currency reserves held by central banks around the world are in dollars.
""I always get asked this question, 'Are we going to be the reserve currency?' No!"" Dimon said at the conference. ""If we are not the pre-eminent military and the pre-eminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency.""
Dimon and the other executives who run the country's banks wield a vast amount of power over our financial system. They're usually among the first to see what's happening in our economy. And this spring, they've been going through a process perhaps best described as ""the five stages of tariff grief.""
CEOs started out in denial about tariffs
Anyone who's endured a significant loss may be familiar with
Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's model
for
processing death and dying
. She described a cycle of five emotions: Denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and acceptance.

Since President Trump took office again in January, Corporate America's top leaders seem to have cycled through them all.
Many started out in
denial
. Back in February, soon after Trump had first announced and then first delayed some new tariffs, the Conference Board surveyed the heads of the largest U.S. companies. The business-focused nonprofit found that CEO confidence was actually
at a three-year high
.
""They are not thinking so much about tariffs. They are thinking about deregulation [and] lower taxes,"" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board,
told NPR
at the time.
Now CEOs are thinking a lot more about tariffs. Their confidence has plummeted in the last three months, the Conference Board
reported in late May
. It was the worst quarter-over-quarter dropoff since the organization started tracking it, 49 years ago.
""Shame on the administration.""
In recent weeks, some Wall Street leaders seem to have moved on to
anger
and
depression
.
""The administration's attempts to use tariffs comes at a dear price to the U.S. economy and … to the U.S. consumer, who will undoubtedly face higher prices in their day-to-day life because of these actions,"" billionaire investor Ken Griffin, a Republican donor and
Trump supporter
as recently as December,
told a
Forbes
conference
last week.
Citadel CEO Ken Griffin speaks during the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025 in Washington, D.C., on April 23, 2025. The billionaire investor and Republican megadonor is warning that President Trump's tariffs will hurt the U.S. economy, and U.S. consumers.

Griffin, founder and CEO of the hedge fund Citadel, also rebuked the president
for lashing out at Walmart
, after the retailer's CEO warned investors that it would have to raise prices as a result of the tariffs.
""We should not criticize CEOs for being honest, right? And that's all the CEO of Walmart was doing,"" Griffin said. ""Shame on the administration.""
White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an emailed statement to NPR that Trump's budget bill will ""further turbocharge America's economic resurgence.""
""Despite endless doomsday predictions about President Trump's tariffs, economic indicators have continued to improve,"" he added.

Wall Street hopes the White House will do more bargaining on trade deals
Griffin's comments reflect a lot of the emotional roller-coaster that Wall Street executives — and the rest of the country — are on, when it comes to figuring out what's going to happen to the U.S. economy.
Some CEOs are trying to call for more
bargaining
, especially with China. Dimon, for example, recently warned the United States against continuing to escalate its trade war with one of its largest trading partners.
""I would engage with China,"" he told the Reagan conference in late May, adding that he'd just returned from a trip to the country. ""They're not scared, folks.""
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon speaks in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 24, 2024. ""We have to get our act together. We have to do it very quickly,"" he said at a recent economic conference.

Administration officials are currently doing just that: Officials from the U.S. and China
are currently in London
for a new round of trade negotiations.
But
many questions remain
about the final shape — and costs — of the taxes that the United States has now added to virtually all imports.
""We do have a lot to lose.""
Some on Wall Street are warning that the United States might need to practice
acceptance
of an economic downturn.
For example, Goldman Sachs currently predicts that the U.S. has a 35% chance of falling into a recession in the next year. That's
an improved outlook
from April, when Trump's initial tariffs plans sent global markets into a tailspin and led Goldman's predicted recession risk to spike to 45%.
But as Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius told a conference hosted by his bank last month, ""35[%] is still a sizable number. And I think a lot of it is around the fact that…the president loves tariffs.""
Many leaders on Wall Street and throughout Corporate America
have been cautious
about criticizing President Trump too directly, in part due to fears of stoking Walmart-style public retribution from the White House.
Sponsor Message
But as Griffin's comments demonstrate, even some of his allies are increasingly worried about how his policies could affect the United States' economic outlook — and its longtime global superpower status.
TCW chief executive Katie Koch, for example, recently pointed out that the United States accounts for less than 5% of the world's population — but accounts for
25% of its gross domestic product
, and
70% of global stock markets
.
""There's this narrative that we need to embark on these policies because somehow we were losing,""
she said
at a conference hosted by the Milken Institute last month.
As Koch warned, ""We've done a lot of winning already — and we do have a lot to lose."""

Several proposed taxes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would shift how money flows from the U.S. to other countries
Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images
For four decades, the US has maintained a consistent policy position: money should be fairly free to come and go in and out of the country. That's changing.
Two sections in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would add friction. First is a 3.5% tax on immigrants sending money home, commonly known as remittances. Second is what's known as Section 899 or, colloquially, the 'revenge tax'. This one is making Wall Street wary. It would slap extra taxes on people and businesses investing in the U.S. if their home countries were deemed to tax Americans unfairly.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia on Monday filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court seeking to block the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.
Planet Money
How 23andMe's bankruptcy led to a run on the gene bank
Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person's express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.
23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and find long-lost relatives. Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. In March it laid off 40% of its staff and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Missouri, raising concerns about the safety of customer data.

Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive and president David Zaslav yielded to the reality of the digital age and to the skepticism of Wall Street investors on Monday by announcing he would split the company into two: one focusing on streaming, the other on its cable networks.
Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, which will include HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie and television studios. The cable business, including CNN, TBS, TNT and Discovery, is to be run by the current corporation's chief financial officer, Gunnar Wiedenfels.
""The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world. It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history,"" Zaslav said in announcing the split.
Sponsor Message
""By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape.""
Under Zaslav, the new digital company will seek to continue building subscribers in countries around the world for its own streaming service while creating content for its bigger competitors - Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime.
Debt weighs down Zaslav's ambition
The break-up represents a collapse of Zaslav's ambitions and aspirations for the mega-media company.
Just three years, two months and one day ago, Zaslav completed the acquisition of Warner Media in a deal valued at $43 billion to create Warner Bros. Discovery. He said the combined company would have the scale and caliber of offerings to compete with digital streaming giants. It didn't. That deal required taking on more than $50 billion in debt. While a significant amount has been paid off, much remains.
Warner Bros. Discovery's history since has been marked by a series of moves to pay down that debt, including the killing of CNN's nascent streaming service (which is just now being rebuilt), bids that failed to win renewal of NBA rights for Turner Sports, and layoffs at various properties.
Sponsor Message
The company has lost nearly half its market valuation since the merger, though shares bounced up by nearly 10% in the hours after Monday's announcement. Zaslav had a compensation package valued at $52 million last year - making him one of the country's highest-paid corporate chieftains,
according to a study published by Harvard Law School
. (
Shareholders voted against it
in a symbolic vote.)
What's CNN's fate?
The transaction is supposed to close by the middle of next year, though it is contingent on an assessment from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that it can proceed free of taxes. President Trump has made clear in his first few months back in office that he is willing to deploy what are supposed to be non-partisan levers of government for political and ideological aims.
Most recently, Trump suggested he would seek to revoke governmental contracts with Tesla after a public falling out with its controlling owner, Elon Musk, who had previously served as his adviser on slashing federal budgets. In the case of Warner Bros. Discovery, Trump has repeatedly blasted CNN as unfair, partisan and ""fake news.""
""These are two much smaller companies than the grand vision [Zaslav] anticipated when he bought the assets from AT&T,"" former CNN US president Jonathan Klein tells NPR. ""The question is: now that they're small enough to be bought, who buys each of these units?""
Comcast really underwent
much the same transformation
- splitting its broadcast, movie and broadband properties from its cable channels.
Several former television executives asked whether the new parent for MSNBC and CNBC – named Versant – might be a natural buyer for Warner Bros. Discovery's cable channels. Or private equity investors intent on maximizing profits might decide to pick up Warner Bros. Discovery's cable networks, Versant - or both.
In any of those scenarios, a new owner would almost certainly have to pick between retaining MSNBC or CNN.

Apple on Monday announced an overhaul of its operating system interface, introduced an app for games and unveiled a live translation feature, but only glancingly acknowledged last year's as-yet-unfulfilled promises on artificial intelligence.
At the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last year, executives introduced plans to use AI to make the virtual assistant Siri more interactive and able to perform complex tasks. Some features have been delayed, though, raising questions about what many analysts see as Apple's relatively slow approach to adopting AI.
On Monday, during the keynote address kicking off this year's WWDC in Cupertino, California, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said the company was continuing work to make the virtual assistant Siri ""more personal.""
Sponsor Message
""This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar,"" he said, adding the company would share more ""in the coming year.""
In a big step, Apple said it will open its ""Apple Intelligence"" AI model to developers so they can better integrate it into their apps. Federighi said this would ""ignite a whole new wave of intelligence."" He showed an example of an app helping prepare a practice test for a student based on class notes.
Much of the presentation on Monday was a demonstration of a new operating system interface that is more tightly linked across Apple devices, with enhanced functionality and a look the company describes as ""Liquid Glass."" The new design, which will be incorporated into everything from phones to watches to iPads, is meant to make every element on screen appear more fluid and reactive to movement.
""I'm happy with the redesign of the operating system, how they brought the operating systems together in a very cohesive way, because that lowers the barrier of entry for users to use multiple devices at the same time,"" said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst at Creative Strategies.
Apple occasionally announces hardware updates or new devices at WWDC, but there were none on Monday.

And on AI more broadly, some observers have criticized Apple's approach.

Apple's AI woes are just one of many challenges the company is facing.
The threat of tariffs looms large, because Apple's products are largely made in countries on which the Trump administration has imposed steep, albeit temporarily suspended, import levies. President Trump has also said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones will
face additional tariffs
if they are not made in the United States.

Some analysts say Apple needs to step up on AI, but is far from out of the game. ""The AI race, as much as we like to talk about it as a race, is a marathon and it's a marathon that changes pace very quickly, pretty much on a monthly basis,"" said Milanesi.
Analysts note that historically, Apple has had great success with products that weren't necessarily the first of their kind, but were hailed as the best.

President Trump has been promising his tariffs will help make America more prosperous.
There's already evidence that tariffs are helping the government's bottom line. The federal government collected $68.9 billion in tariffs and excise taxes during the first five months of the year, according to Treasury Department
data collected by the Bipartisan Policy Center

That's a 78% increase from the same period a year ago.  Much of the additional revenue came in April and May, after Trump imposed tariffs of at least 10% on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries.

Wall Street CEOs are cycling through the five stages of tariff grief
But whether the tariffs are making Americans more prosperous is another question. The tariff windfall isn't coming out of thin air. Nor is it being paid by foreign governments, as Trump often argues.
Tariffs revenue is coming from Americans' pockets
The tariffs are mostly being paid by American businesses and families.
""It's a tax on the backs of people who are importing either raw materials or, in my case, wine"" says Patrick Allen, a Columbus, Ohio-based importer who sells French wine throughout the country. ""And eventually it gets built into the price everybody is paying for goods.""

The White House touted that forecast as a partial answer to the

that would be racked up by the president's tax cuts in the sweeping Republican bill that passed the House last month.
But the CBO also acknowledged that the tariffs will result in higher inflation this year and next, as well as slower economic growth.
The overall drag on the economy is hard to estimate, because the U.S. hasn't had tariffs this high since the Great Depression era. But some experts think the damage could be substantial.

""Some are forecasting larger impacts and potentially pushing us into recession,"" says Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""We won't know until we see the fallout.""
Thousands of jobs cut in manufacturing
A
survey from the Institute for Supply Management
suggests tariffs are a substantial drag on the manufacturing sector, which
cut 8,000 jobs last month
.
""Most suppliers are passing through tariffs at full value to us,"" a purchasing manager of a chemical factory said in the report. ""The position being communicated is that the supplier considers it a tax, and taxes always get passed through to the customer.""
One big issue for business owners: cash flow
For importers like Allen, tariffs are also a cash-flow challenge, because he has to pay the tax in advance, before making any sales.
""Say if I order $100,000 of wine from France, if there's a 20% tariff, I'll have to pay $20,000 to get the wine out of customs before I sell a bottle,"" Allen says.
Trump initially announced a 20% tariff on imports from the European Union. He later reduced that to 10% for a 90-day period, but has since threatened to increase the tariff on European goods to 50%.
Allen would typically be ordering wine now to sell in the fall and the run-up to the Christmas holidays. But many of his customers are sitting on their hands because they have no idea what the tariff will be.
""Importers are afraid. They don't know when the other shoe is going to drop,"" Allen says. ""We're going to be out of stuff on the shelves. But the thing is, all of those out-of-stocks on the shelves represent money we would have been making that we won't be making.""
Customs broker Margie Shapiro used to pay tariffs in advance for her clients and collect the money later, which was possible when the average tariff rate was under 3%.  With today's much higher levies, she can't front the cost any more and importers are having to make those payments themselves.

business,"Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, was surprised when a team of NPR journalists asked to talk.
""If you told me I'd be on NPR and in a political leaning podcast like five years ago, I'd be like: You're crazy,"" he said during a conversation in a podcast studio near his home in Miami.
Politics
Republicans can't stop using the word 'woke'. But what does it really mean?
Portnoy is of interest after an election in which men voted heavily for Trump — and that included Portnoy, who is sometimes identified with ""Barstool conservatism,"" a brand of politics that, according to
National Review,
is a non-religious ""potpourri of sexual libertinism, anti-authoritarianism, anti-wokeness, and lots of f-bombs.""
His business rose along with the internet and sports gambling. Barstool podcasts carry many, many gambling ads. As its creator, Portnoy has made enough money to own houses on Nantucket and near Miami while making million-dollar bets on football games and cryptocurrency. He's also received years of criticism for remarks about unions, race, women, and even rape that he insists were jokes. He feuded with, and sued,
Business Insider
after it published
stories alleging sexual misconduct
, ultimately dropping an appeal in 2023 after his lawsuit was dismissed.
Sponsor Message
As a star figure in a media company that caters to a large male audience, he's also seen as part of the ""manosphere,"" internet figures who speak to the interests, and sometimes the grievances, of male voters.
Portnoy spoke to
Morning Edition
as part of a series meant to put real questions to controversial or influential figures — people who may seem different at length than they do in our frantic, distracted, overheated national discourse. Previous guests include
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, podcaster
Steve Bannon
and Harvard president
Alan Garber
.
Below are a few key points from the interview, which you can watch above.
The style matters as much as the substance
Portnoy seemed most focused on culture and attitudes. He said his vote for Trump was more ""an indictment of the Democrats than an endorsement of Trump's politics."" The indictment of Democrats centers on a lack of ""blunt talk,"" an excess of ""woke politics,"" and what he perceived as a desire to ""shame"" men in general and him in particular.
He differs with Trump on several issues
If politics was purely about issues, Portnoy might be closer to Democrats. He favors abortion rights, and when he talks about immigration, he seems a bit more lenient than the Trump administration.
Sponsor Message
""I don't necessarily think you should go back in time,"" he said. ""If somebody isn't here legally, but they're a productive member of society with no issues, I don't think that you go say, 'Get out of here.'""
He's very successful and feels looked down upon
In explaining his tilt to the right, Portnoy talked of founding Barstool as a four-page paper newspaper on sports gambling in the early 2000s.
""I started a business from scratch and really didn't get any help, moved home, worked, didn't take a vacation day for 10 years and grinded my ass off to get where it is. And I felt that I should somehow have shame as being a white person who wants to make a lot of money and live a great life. And that bothered me.""
His language seems to have evolved, a little
During our conversation, Portnoy mentioned a word suggesting society was becoming more feminine that he ""would have used back in the day.""
He also recounted a moment that, he says, still leads him to be labeled racist: He sang the N-word in a social media post years ago, one of a number of times he used the word. ""I would never do it again,"" he says now. ""But different times …. I didn't realize the impact that it would have on some people. I won't do it again. But there is context to things. There's more texture to things. And a lot of times I feel like in this internet age, it has blown out. I mean, that clip still gets used against me. If someone doesn't like me, I hear that every time.""
More recently, the free speech advocate has made news by denouncing the use of a slur against Jews in a Barstool bar in Philadelphia.
He could vote for a Democrat
""I would vote for a Democrat. And I have voted for Democrats,"" he said, but added that he didn't want to be ""demonized"" by the party for his language and views. ""Not everything is nearly as serious as it may seem,"" he said. ""Guys can say a girl is pretty without being sexist."""

They've pushed for that dream with tariffs and tax breaks and subsidies. But what happens when one multinational company actually responds to those incentives, and tries to set up shop in Small Town, USA?
Today on the show – how a battery factory ignited a political firestorm over what kind of factories we actually want in our backyard. And what happens when the global economy meets town hall democracy.

For the last couple of years, U.S. labor productivity has been on the rise. And economists don't know exactly why. So today on the show, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago plays economic detective and helps us investigate some different theories about why U.S. workers seem to be more productive than in prior decades.

Hiring slowed last month, as President Trump's tariffs and federal job cuts began to weigh on the U.S. economy.
Employers added 139,000 jobs in May, according to
a report released Friday
by the Labor Department. That's a modest downshift from the previous month.  Job gains in March and April were also revised down by a total of 95,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, but the workforce shrank by 625,000 people.
Hospitals, restaurants and transportation companies continued to add workers in May. The federal government cut another 22,000 workers, although that was largely offset by hiring in state and local governments.  Federal employment has fallen by 59,000 since the beginning of the year.
Politics
Officially, 59,000 federal jobs are gone under Trump. There's more to the picture
Factories also cut 8,000 jobs in May.  A
survey of factory managers
released this week by the Institute for Supply Management showed Trump's tariffs are a considerable drag on the manufacturing sector, where orders, output and employment all fell.
""We have entered the waiting portion of the wait and see, it seems,"" one manager wrote. ""Business activity is slower and smaller this month. Chaos does not bode well for anyone, especially when it impacts pricing.""
Average wages in May were up 3.9% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department report.  That's likely more than enough to outpace price increases.

CBO says Trump's tariffs could cut U.S. deficit by $2.8 trillion over 10 years
If the tariffs remain in place, they're expected to reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2035, according to
a CBO letter released Wednesday
. The money would also offset the cost of the sweeping budget bill passed by the House last month.
""The distributional effect of tariffs, because it's a sales tax and economists have long said sales taxes are regressive, they hit low and middle income people much harder than upper income people,"" Kaine, who sits on the Senate Budget Committee, said.
""Is it fair to reduce the deficit off the backs of everyday folks rather than make the wealthiest carry a fair share,"" he added.
Kaine further discussed his concerns over the effects of tariffs and their projected impact on the budget deficit with NPR's Steve Inskeep.
The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Steve Inskeep
: You have been concerned about the budget deficit, the amount that we borrow every year, the federal debt, the amount of borrowing or debt that accumulates over time. According to the CBO, the tariffs would reduce the deficit. Is that useful even if you dislike tariffs?
Sen. Tim Kaine
: Steve, you've described one piece of the puzzle. The CBO said this Trump tariff regime, which is essentially a sales tax, is going to raise a lot of revenue. And that raising of revenue will do three things. It will reduce the deficit. It will raise costs on everyday Americans for groceries and building supplies, home supplies [and] clothes. And it will also shrink the economy. But it's not the only piece of the puzzle, because basically what the tariff revenue is doing, it's being used to finance a huge tax cut for the wealthiest, together with cuts in everyday programs that people rely on like Medicaid and nutrition assistance.
Sponsor Message
Inskeep
: So, it would pay down federal debt, but it would cause someone making $70,000 or $50,000 a year to pay it rather than somebody making $70 million or $50 million. Is that what you're saying?
Kaine
: Absolutely. The distributional effect of tariffs, because it's a sales tax and economists have long said sales taxes are regressive, they hit low and middle income people much harder than upper income people. Because lower and middle income people spend more of their income on purchasing things rather than socking it away in savings or the stock market. Is it fair to reduce the deficit off the backs of everyday folks rather than make the wealthiest carry a fair share? So, again, the piece of the puzzle, reduce deficit, sure. But raise costs on everyday people and shrink the economy. Is it worth it? You add to it this reduction of all the key programs people rely on this reconciliation bill. And now you see Donald Trump is trying to do and turn to what he did in term one, a tax break that benefits the wealthiest at the expense of everybody else.
Inskeep
: I have to ask you about this other news, the break up at the White House. President Trump and Elon Musk very publicly breaking up just after Elon Musk left government service. What do you make of this?
Kaine
: Well, you know, no surprise, but surprise. So, I think anybody who kind of is aware of the personalities of these two individuals would have predicted the breakup. [...] Musk is concerned about some features of this bill, the deficit effect of the reconciliation.And so there are many things about this bill that caused grave concern. And that's why the House product is taking on an awful lot of water in the Senate. And if the Senate does pass this back to the House, I think it's going to be in dramatically different form.
Sponsor Message
Inskeep
: Dramatically different form, meaning lower deficits, among other things?
Kaine
: For my sake, I'm going to try to offer amendments and say, 'Hey, if you don't extend deep estate tax cuts for the wealthiest, you don't have to cut food assistance to poor families. So, everybody in the chamber, let's vote on that.' We're going to put up amendments like that. And I think some of these amendments would be pretty darn salient.

Jose Luis Magana/AP
At times, President Trump's senior adviser Kari Lake has said she wants to shut down Voice of America, arguing it is
rife with ideological bias and waste
. Now, Lake says she'll keep the federally funded international network staffed at levels above those required by the law.
In her view,
spelled out to Congress earlier this week
, that means two people apiece to run foreign language services for Afghanistan, China and Iran and 11 people for Voice of America itself. The sister network that broadcasts to Cuba would retain 33 staffers.
In all, Lake envisions the agency that encompasses the international broadcasters with 81 people after mid-August — a sliver of the 1,300 she first put on paid leave in March. Lake says she is taking the actions to comply with Trump's
March executive order
that it be reduced to the minimum statutory requirements.
Sponsor Message
That very contention is being tested in federal court.
Yet the first few layoffs of the 800 permanent staffers — almost all of whom have been on indefinite paid leave for most of Trump's new term — began Thursday, according to three employees with knowledge of events. (They asked for anonymity to share developments, citing the lack of job security.) The roughly 500 contractors were paid through May 30, but their positions have been terminated.
""It's humanly impossible""
Former Voice of America leaders said that Lake's move to gut the workforce would be almost tantamount to killing the network.
""When you punch someone and leave them in the street for dead, how can you expect them to come back?"" said Kelu Chao, who served in top positions at both Voice of America and its federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. ""It's humanly impossible.""
""Nobody should be under the illusion that with a staff that small, anything really effective can be done,"" former Voice of America Director David Ensor said. ""It's an important source of soft power for the United States. And we are crazy to get rid of it.""
Voice of America journalists expressed a fresh wave of outrage at the job cuts.
Politics
From bromance to breakup: How Elon Musk and Donald Trump blew up
""The idea that you can make staff this size fulfill our mandate to provide accurate, objective, and comprehensive news to a global audience, is absurd,"" Patsy Widakuswara, who had been a White House bureau chief, said in a statement. ""It would be comical if it weren't so tragic. My colleagues and I are not just losing our jobs and journalism, we are abandoning the 360 million people around the world who depend on us weekly for independent news and abdicating the United States' voice and influence in the world.""
Sponsor Message
Widakuswara is a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit filed against Lake and the Trump administration by a coalition of Voice of America employees, contractors, unions and press-rights advocates.
""This plan seeks to end a decades-long mission of providing news and information in repressive media environments around the world, particularly those targeted with propaganda by America's adversaries,"" said Kate Neeper, the director of strategy and performance at the U.S. Agency for Global Media. She, too, has been placed on indefinite leave and is suing Lake in the same case.
Lake sent her letter Tuesday
to Sen. James Risch of Idaho and Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the Republicans who lead the two Congressional committees on international matters. In that note, Lake said the plan to wipe out the workforce was devised by senior career leaders at USAGM, including its general counsel, Royce Min.
Interview highlights
Former DOGE engineer says federal waste and fraud were 'relatively nonexistent'
Min left the agency in early May. (Lake and Min did not respond to separate requests for comment.) According to materials attached to the memo Lake sent to Congress, the agency's chief financial officer signed the plan on March 18 — just days after Lake first put nearly the entire workforce on leave.
Back and forth in court
Lake was rebuked by the federal judge overseeing the VOA lawsuit and several related cases, but
given a reprieve
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It lifted an injunction preventing her from carrying out her plans while it considers the substantive merits of the appeal.
Nonetheless, Lake is under order to ensure the agency and the network maintain the ""statutory minimum"" staff and services. The appellate court said that the Voice of America staffers suing Lake therefore could urge the federal judge on the case, Royce C. Lamberth, to compel the agency to show how it was meeting its statutory requirements, which include serving ""as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.""
Politics
Partisan battle lines form over Trump's plan to defund NPR & PBS
Late last week, the Voice of America plaintiffs did just that. ""VOA sat silent for over a month until May 27, when VOA broadcast a mere five minutes of content to only three provinces in Afghanistan,"" the filing read. ""That blip of activity is not enough to fulfill VOA's statutory mandate, and it does not mitigate Defendants' thus far inexorable march to shut down VOA.""
Under Lake, the U.S. Agency for Global Media has canceled contacts with three major international news wires, set up an accelerated schedule to sell off its D.C. headquarters, and canceled a long-term lease in its new headquarters. Lake has
struck a deal
to offer programming from the far right One America News Network for use by Voice of America's remaining programmers and news executives.
Sponsor Message
Since the founding of the Voice of America during the early days of American involvement in World War II, Congress has funded it as an exercise in soft power: by having credible news coverage of the war, the Voice of America was intended to both put the lie to enemy propaganda and advertise U.S. values of political pluralism and tolerance for debate and dissent.
That philosophy was expanded to support its subsequent sister networks, which include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. (These networks are technically privately incorporated and receive grants allocated by Congress and administered by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.)
The appellate court ruled that Lake and the agency must provide the money Congress allocated for Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks in a timely way; they have embarked on mass furloughs as money has been withheld. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has received an infusion of millions of dollars from the European Union to keep it going temporarily. The agency says it will start doling out those funds.
Even so, the U.S. Agency for Global Media has canceled multiple satellite contracts for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, according to the network, including the ones that carry a popular round-the-clock Russian language service

Musk's companies have long been fueled by taxpayer money, whether in the form of massive government contracts, low-interest loans, tax breaks and other support that helped make Musk one of the world's richest people.
Over the past two decades, companies run by Musk have received tens of billions of dollars in federal backing.

Trump threatens to cut Musk contracts as feud quickly escalates
In turn, the U.S. government has become reliant on Musk, from space travel, to national security to the future of green transportation.
So when President Trump on Thursday
threatened to end
Musk's government subsidies and contracts in a spiraling feud between
the former political allies
, it was greeted with some skepticism.
Musk has deep ties to the U.S. space program and intelligence community
Musk's companies have become inextricably tied to the federal government, particularly SpaceX's crucial role in the U.S. space program.
The company's rockets now provide the only way for U.S. astronauts to get to and from the International Space Station.
""While their political partnership appears to be at an end, it is difficult to imagine the government canceling SpaceX contracts anytime soon,"" said Dan Grazier, senior fellow and program director at the Stimson Center, a think tank focused on national security.
""It will be some time before any of the company's competitors will be able to take up the slack, so it looks like the president and the tech mogul will have to find a way to get along,"" he said.
It's unclear if Musk was trolling or being serious, but he responded to Trump's threats by
saying
SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft, which has been used for years to ferry crews and cargo to the space station.

there are now
astronauts at the station. They were taken there by a SpaceX capsule.
Walking away from the federal government would strand those crew members and complicate the Trump administration's goal of landing astronauts on the moon in the coming years.

Federal support for Tesla and electric vehicle infrastructure in doubt
Tesla, the biggest electric vehicle company in the U.S. (which also controls the country's largest charging network), has been a major beneficiary of federal support.

The version of the bill passed by the House
would chop
consumer tax credits for buying electric vehicles and slash federal funding for charging stations.

Musk has previously opposed the EV tax credits, viewing them as mostly benefiting his competitors, but he changed his tune as Tesla's profits and sales plummeted globally since Musk began overseeing mass layoffs and other shake-ups to the federal government through the cost-cutting unit, the Department of Government Efficiency.
The end of federal programs aimed at growing the EV sector would not damage Tesla as severely as other problems the automaker is confronting, said John Helveston, a professor at George Washington University who studies the electric vehicle industry.

Trump administration pauses $3 billion marked for electric vehicle charging stations
During the Biden administration,
Congress devoted
billions of dollars to expand electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. A major pillar of this plan was having Tesla make its chargers compatible with other vehicles, something Tesla agreed to in exchange for a slice of the federal funds. That plan
has been halted
by the Trump administration, even before Congress tried to pass the Trump-backed tax policy bill that would roll back support for EVs even more.
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, said further pain for Tesla could eventually plunge Musk's riches.
""Tesla is hugely reliant on federal largesse for the build-out of EV charging infrastructure, not to mention federal regulatory approval for his continued autonomous driving and robotics experiments,"" Sonnenfeld said.
""His wealth is highly precarious,"" he said, noting that most of Musk's fortune is tied to his stake in Tesla. ""The reality is that Musk's position is far weaker than many realize.""
Subsidies or not, Musk will ""continue to thrive""

Trump buys a Tesla with Elon Musk in tow, at the White House
The acrimonious Trump-Musk implosion on Thursday came only months after Trump
transformed
the driveway of the White House's South Lawn into a Tesla showroom, and after the White House
tapped
Starlink to help expand internet across the White House campus.
Both were performative gestures that crystalized the billionaire's cozy relationship with the president, who was willing to shill for Musk after he dished out
more than
a quarter-billion dollars to support Trump's run for president.
So will the Trump-Musk breakup cut the opposite way and inflict pain on Musk's companies?
Sponsor Message
Paul Levinson, a professor at Fordham University, said perhaps it will lead to more short-term stock market drops for Tesla and a hit to his wealth. But even if some of the federal money that flows to Musk's business empire disappears, it will not likely hamper the billionaire in the long run, he said.
""Musk has ample resources to sustain those losses, reshuffle and rebuild his companies and holdings, and come out ahead and on top,"" Levinson said. ""Bottom line: if all the Trump government does in its feud with Musk is attack his financial interests, Musk is very likely to not only survive but continue to thrive."""

Staffing shortages have forced the U.S. federal government to scale back the price checks it uses to calculate the inflation rate. Economists are warning that could lead to less accurate cost-of-living reports.
Every month, hundreds of government employees check the price of goods and services in cities around the country and those numbers are crunched to produce the inflation measure known as the consumer price index, or CPI.
This week, the Labor Department said it had cut back on price checks nationwide and suspended them entirely in some cities because it didn't have enough people to do the work.

The agency suspended data gathering altogether in Lincoln, Neb., and Provo, Utah, in April and halted it in Buffalo, N.Y., this month.
Federal government hiring freeze
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said in
a statement
that it ""makes reductions when current resources can no longer support the collection effort.""
The federal government has been under a hiring freeze since President Trump took office. And since January, the overall federal workforce has been cut by 26,000, according to the Labor Department's own tally — though the true size of the cutbacks is
somewhat unclear
.
Economy
How reliable is the government's economic data? Under Trump, there are real concerns
The department said it expects the reduced data gathering to have ""minimal impact"" on the overall inflation rate, but warned it could cause more volatility in regional cost-of-living reports or the price information on particular items.
Government making educated guesses on prices of more goods
The cutbacks come as economists are on the lookout for signs that Trump's tariffs could rekindle inflation.
""This is the worst possible time to make staffing cuts to the CPI of all data sources,"" economist Ernie Tedeschi of the Yale Budget Lab
wrote on social media
.
""Note that staffing cuts don't necessarily mean CPI will come in lower! The error could just as easily be a CPI that's too high, and that's also bad. We want accuracy as we try to navigate the uncertainty,"" wrote Tedeschi, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration.

With steel tariffs doubling today, a North Carolina manufacturer wonders how to compete
Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed taxes of 10 to 50% on nearly everything the U.S. imports. Those taxes have already raised tens of billions of dollars in revenue.
If the tariffs become permanent, they're expected to reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2035, according to
a letter released Wednesday
by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
A separate CBO forecast out earlier in the day shows the combination of tax cuts and spending cuts in the House-passed budget bill would
increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion
over the same period.
Sponsor Message
There are big unknowns, however
The tariff forecast includes a number of caveats.
""Because the United States has implemented no increases in tariffs of this size in many decades, there is little relevant empirical evidence on their effects,"" writes CBO director Phillip Swagel.  The high taxes might discourage imports more than expected, which would result in lower revenues. On the other hand, if imports drop less than expected due to tariffs, the government could end up raising more money.
Business
Sellers of dog leashes and mom gear hope court rulings lead to tariff relief
The forecast assumes that most of the tariffs in place in mid-May are made permanent. It does not include the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, or the prospect that higher tariffs, which have been temporarily suspended, might return.
Many of the tariffs were imposed under a novel reading of a 1977 law, and they are
being challenged in court
, though they remain in effect for now.
In addition to cutting deficits, forecasters project the tariffs will result in higher inflation this year and next and slower economic growth.
Forecasters say tariffs will likely raise prices for both rich families and poor families, although the CBO is still sorting out which end of the income ladder would be hit hardest."

As GOP congressional leaders are vowing to move full steam ahead to approve President Trump's request to eliminate all federal funding for public media for the next two years, a group of 29 Senate Democrats are warning the broadcast outlets should be ""protected, not decimated.""
In a
letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune
, these senators argue the proposed clawback of money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) ""would have detrimental effects on local stations, which rely on this funding to provide critical services to millions of Americans across the country.""
The effort comes a day after the Trump administration
formally requested
Congress approve a $9.4 billion rescissions bill. The proposal includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion in cuts to public broadcasting. CPB distributes that funding to NPR and PBS and their member stations across the country. Congress approved the funding for the next two years for the public-private entity as part of the government funding bill Trump signed in March.

Most Capitol Hill Republicans express support for the package, but a few have raised concerns about some of the cuts to State Department programs. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters she could not back the proposed cuts to PEPFAR, a public health program created by President George W. Bush to address HIV/AIDS. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the chamber would act on the package soon. Under the rescissions rules, Congress has 45 days to act. The House is scheduled to vote first next week. The Senate can then approve the package with a simple majority. With the GOP holding a 53-seat majority in the upper chamber, it's unclear if there are four Republican votes to block the package.
House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Wednesday ""these are common sense cuts."" He criticized news coverage by both NPR and PBS as ideologically biased, asserting, ""There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds. We're in a different era now.""
GOP leaders say the House will vote on the package next week. Senior Republicans told NPR they believed the bill would pass.
The Democratic senators' letter notes the ""vast majority"" of CPB money is allocated to local public radio and television stations. They say the cuts ""will have an immediate and significant impact for stations in rural communities that heavily rely on CPB funding to provide critical services and could likely result in the elimination of programming or outright closure of stations in areas already faced with limited connectivity."" They urge Thune to maintain ""full funding"" for CPB.

Trump has called NPR and PBS ""
THE RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS'
"" and denounced their news coverage and cultural programming. NPR's chief executive, Katherine Maher, hinted on Tuesday that the network might consider filing suit if Congress passes the rescissions package. NPR would not address what its legal strategy would be if that happens.
""The proposal, which is explicitly viewpoint-based and aimed at controlling and punishing content, violates the Public Broadcasting Act, the First Amendment, and the Due Process Clause,"" Maher said in a statement.
No Senate Republican signed the letter, led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., but Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski voiced support for public media in an editorial in the
Fairbanks Daily News Miner
earlier this month. She said the loss of funding for local stations in her home state would be ""devastating.""
""Not only would a large portion of Alaska communities lose their local programming, but warning systems for natural disasters, power outages, boil water advisories, and other alerts would be severely hampered. What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska,"" Murkowski wrote.
A group of 104 House Democrats led by New York Rep. Dan Goldman, sent a
letter
on Tuesday to the top Republican and Democrat on the House spending panel that oversees CPB. ""Without federal support for public broadcasting, many localities would struggle to receive timely, reliable local news and educational content, especially remote and rural communities that commercial newsrooms are increasingly less likely to invest in,"" the lawmakers wrote.
Trump separately moved to defund public broadcasting outlets by
issuing an executive order
last month instructing CPB to stop releasing money to NPR and PBS. NPR and a group of local stations sued the administration, arguing the order was unconstitutional. Separately PBS and one of its member stations in Minnesota also filed suit to block the order.

Heads of both NPR and PBS
testified
before a House oversight panel and maintained that cutting funding for CPB would especially hit rural stations the most - where communities don't have other private media outlets to report on national news, but also on important local stories like natural disasters.

The last time a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump moved to slash Medicaid spending, in 2017, a key political force stood in their way: GOP governors.
Now, as Congress steamrolls toward passing historic Medicaid cuts of about
$1 trillion over 10 years
through Trump's tax and spending legislation, red state governors are saying little publicly about what it does to health care — even as they face reductions that will punch multibillion-dollar
holes in their states' budgets
.
Medicaid, a program jointly run by states and the federal government, covers more than 70 million low-income or disabled people, including nearly half of the nation's children. Republicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say
don't deserve government assistance
, and they have long sought to scale it back.

5 ways Trump's tax bill will limit health care access
Some of the biggest health cuts in the legislation Trump calls the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" are achieved through new policies that would reduce enrollment by imposing more paperwork demands on enrollees, including a requirement that many prove they're working. Those policies would affect only states that expanded Medicaid to more low-income people under the Affordable Care Act.
Nineteen of those states are
led by Republican governors
. Their silence on the bill's health measures is giving political cover to GOP lawmakers from their states as they seek to cut Medicaid coverage for millions of people who gained it within the last decade.
KFF Health News contacted all 19 governors for comment on the legislation's Medicaid cuts. Only six responded. Most said they backed imposing a work requirement on adult Medicaid enrollees.
""Implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults is a good and necessary reform so that Medicaid is being used for temporary assistance and not a permanent entitlement,"" said Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.
""Governor Rhoden supports workforce participation as a requirement of Medicaid expansion eligibility,"" said Josie Harms, a spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, adding that congressional lawmakers have the governor's support: ""South Dakota has an excellent federal delegation, and Governor Rhoden trusts them to fight for South Dakota's priorities while delivering on President Trump's promises.""

In a sign of how the political winds have changed, none of the governors said anything about the legislation's crackdown on another significant cut, to
provider taxes
— a tool that nearly all of their states use to help pay their share of Medicaid and gain additional funds from the federal government. That change is expected to cost states billions.
A bipartisan issue no longer
In contrast to the radio silence from GOP governors, Democratic governors have campaigned against the megabill for weeks.
Interview highlights
Maine can't afford to lose federal funding, governor says
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro posted
on the social media platform X
that Trump and congressional Republicans were misleading Americans by saying they were cutting only waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.
""They're rushing to kick hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians off their healthcare — and lying about it,"" he posted. ""The damage this will do here in Pennsylvania and across America is staggering and will be felt for years to come.""
In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul on July 1 charged that Trump's legislation would devastate hospitals and could lead to more than 34,000 job cuts in her state.
""The collective impact of the GOP reconciliation bill in Washington, D.C., could force hospitals to curtail critically needed services such as maternity care and psychiatric treatment, not to mention to downsize operations, and even close entirely,"" she said
in a statement
.
In 2017, the chorus was bipartisan, as Republican governors in
Ohio
,
Nevada
, and
Massachusetts
spoke out against cutting Medicaid. Trump's bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and roll back its Medicaid expansion narrowly failed in the Senate.
""It's been surprising that red-state governors, particularly those in Medicaid expansion states, haven't spoken out against Medicaid cuts,"" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. ""Republican governors were a potent political force in the failed 2017 effort to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion.""
Interview highlights
Republicans' big bill could hit rural hospitals hard
What's changed since 2017, policy experts say, is that there are fewer moderate Republican governors, and GOP state executives who advocated for Medicaid expansion over a decade ago are no longer in office.
Additionally, seven of the then-red states that expanded Medicaid
did so via ballot initiative
, mostly over opposition from their governors.
In fact, the Medicaid work requirement is backed by many Republican governors, even if it means less federal Medicaid money and leads to fewer people covered.
Several states, including Arkansas and Ohio, have already passed state laws to implement a requirement that adults enrolled under the ACA's Medicaid expansion work, volunteer, go to school, or participate in job training. Most states have yet to bring work requirement programs to fruition because they are waiting for federal government approval.

Charles ""Chip"" Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group of investor-owned hospitals, said that while fewer governors have engaged publicly in trying to block Medicaid cuts under the bill, federal lawmakers are hearing from legislators in their states.
A political dilemma for Republican governors is that, unlike in 2017, the bill before Congress is not legislation aimed expressly at repealing Obamacare. Its scope is broader than health care, and would extend many of Trump's tax cuts, and direct billions in new spending toward border security, immigration enforcement, and the military, while also cutting health care spending.
""It's like playing multidimensional chess rather than focusing on one issue,"" Kahn said.
Larry Jacobs
, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said some Republican governors may have expressed concerns privately to their states' GOP senators but are not speaking out publicly for fear of drawing Trump's wrath.
""Why are they being cagey? Trump and not wanting to be 'Liz Cheney'd,'"" Jacobs said, referring to the Republican former Wyoming lawmaker whom Trump helped oust after she served as vice chair of an inquiry into his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
Walking political tightropes
The political peril Republican lawmakers face in publicly challenging Trump remains explicit. On June 29, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he would not run for reelection after he voiced concerns about the bill and the president threatened to back a primary challenger. Tillis was one of three GOP senators to vote against it on July 1, though it still narrowly passed.
In addition to the work requirement, the biggest Medicaid cuts in the bill stem from its restrictions on provider taxes — levies that states impose on hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care institutions to help increase their federal reimbursement. Much of the additional money is then returned to the health care providers in the form of higher payments for their Medicaid patients.

The practice, which has been adopted in every state but Alaska,
has been criticized

The Senate bill would limit the money states could raise — a move that would mean billions in funding cuts to states and their hospitals.
The states with Republican governors that expanded Medicaid are Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Utah.
One of the governors who expressed concerns about repealing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in 2017 was Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Democrat at the time.
In a
June 2017 letter
to West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, Justice wrote: ""Since so many of our people count on Medicaid, any cut to Medicaid would destroy families in West Virginia."" He added that ""the consequences would be beyond catastrophic.""
On July 1, Justice — elected to the Senate as a Republican last year — voted for Trump's megabill, including its Medicaid cuts.
""The Senator believes this bill strikes a good balance between protecting the most vulnerable and those who rely on the program while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure the program is run efficiently for those deserving,"" William O'Grady, a Justice spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday.

""I try to walk at least four or five times a week,"" says Freeman, who's a well-known potter in Alpine, Texas. ""I also work about 20 hours in the studio.""
But in the past year or so, Freeman hasn't felt like herself. She's been more tired and sluggish. And she has had more trouble shedding a little extra weight. ""I try and I can't lose it,"" she says.

On the first day, she uncovered a big clue: About two hours after lunch, her blood sugar nosedived below her baseline levels.
Dips trigger overeating
Studies
have shown conclusively
that these monitors greatly help
people manage diabetes
. But in 2024,
the FDA approved
the first continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Now, two companies, Dexcom and Abbott, sell and market the devices to anyone who wants to track their blood sugar. They cost about $50 and last for a couple of weeks.
But scientists are still trying to figure out if — and how — these monitors could help people without diabetes. Can the data motivate people to eat a healthier diet by helping them learn how food affects their bodies?

Should you track your blood sugar with a continuous glucose monitor?
One of the scientists leading this effort is
Sarah Berry, a nutritionist
at King's College London. She's also chief scientist at the
company Zoe
, which sells personalized nutrition plans that incorporate these devices.
In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University, Berry and her colleagues led two
large studies
in which thousands of people without diabetes wear continuous glucose monitors while they eat tens of thousands of meals.
After analyzing all of their data, Berry says one finding stands out: ""A big proportion of people are what we call dippers,"" she says.
Sponsor Message
If you're a dipper, your blood sugar sometimes acts in a specific way: After eating carbohydrates, it rises quickly, and then about two to three hours later, it sometimes plummets low, below your baseline, or fasting, level.
""So you'll have this big increase followed by this big crash,"" Berry says. ""Not everyone gets these dips, but we see that quite a high proportion of people do.""
These dips can trigger overeating, their study found, so it may make it harder to lose weight.
""If you are dipping, then you feel
more hungry more quickly
, and on average you tend to eat 80 calories more at the next meal and 320 calories more over a whole day,"" she says.

Less snacking, more satisfaction: Some foods boost levels of an Ozempic-like hormone
But eating more wasn't the only problem with dips. Berry's team has found that the sugar crashes also correlated with a person's mood. During a dip, people tended to feel less alert and more fatigued, she and her colleagues
reported in the journal
Nature Metabolism
.
These conclusions line up with previous studies on people with diabetes, says
Dalia Perelman
, who's a research dietitian at Stanford University and wasn't involved in this research.
""When your blood sugar is high, people tend to be lethargic, fatigued, and thirsty,"" Perelman says. ""You're just like, ugh.""
When your blood sugar is low, you're jittery. You can have heart palpitations. And you become super hungry. ""Low blood sugar gives your body very strong signals,"" she says. ""You really feel terrible,""  which brings us back to Judy Freeman in Alpine, Texas.
The first day Freeman wore the glucose monitor, she ate lunch as usual. About two hours later, she started to feel horrible. ""I had this really sinking feeling. It was a sort of anxiety or depression. I felt like if I don't get up, I'm just going to stop breathing and die. It was so overpowering,"" Freeman says.

When Freeman glanced at the monitor, she could hardly believe what she saw: ""My blood sugar had shot up at some point, and then it plummeted down to the lowest point.""
This sinking feeling wasn't new to Freeman. She's had it from time to time. ""I just never, ever thought it was in any way correlated with what I ate or anything like that.
""
If you are concerned that your blood sugar may be fluctuating wildly and you want to even things out, here are three things you can try:
1. Put some clothes on those carbs
Don't eat meals and snacks that consist mostly of carbohydrates, Perelman says. ""Don't eat naked carbs.""
Instead, eat them with protein and healthy fats. That means oils from vegetables, seeds and nuts, but also fats from fish. So add eggs to breakfast, canned fish for lunch or tofu for dinner.

We've heard we need more fiber in our diets. Here are 8 easy tips for getting there

""Fiber and protein together
put a speed bump
on your digestion,"" says clinical
nutritionist Karen Kennedy
. ""They really stabilize your blood sugar.""
2. Sprinkle the carbs throughout the day
To prevent dips, you want your gut to slowly drip carbs into your blood, not douse it with a deluge of sugars, Perelman says. So don't eat a bunch of carbohydrates all at one meal.
For preventing dips, ""it doesn't matter how many carbs you ate throughout the day,"" she says. ""It matters how many carbs you've had at each meal.""
3. Pay attention to what you eat first at a meal
With food, order matters, too. Eat the protein, fiber and fat
first
at a meal and the carbs
last
, Kennedy says.

If your blood sugar keeps a more even keel, then your mood and hunger will do the same.
And here's the great part: You don't need to buy a glucose monitor to figure this out, says Sarah Berry at King's College London. Simply pay attention to how you feel about two hours after a meal. If you get moody, anxious or super hungry, you're probably a dipper.

MILWAUKEE – Supporters of reproductive rights are celebrating a win in Wisconsin. After years of litigation over an
1849 law
that conservatives argue criminalizes abortions in the state, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the law does not ban abortion.
This means abortions can continue in the state.
It marks the end of a saga that began when
Roe v. Wade
was overturned in 2022, ending federal constitutional protections for abortion. While it was clear in some states that abortion would be banned, and in others that abortion would be protected, Wisconsin found itself in a legal gray area.
Sponsor Message
Because of the 1849 law, abortion providers in the state stopped offering the procedure. But Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued at the time, challenging the law, and the issue of how to interpret the 1849 statute has been in the courts since June of 2022.
In December 2023, the trial court found that the law doesn't outlaw abortions, that it is actually a feticide law that makes it illegal to attack and kill a woman's child without her consent. Since that ruling, people have been able to get abortions in Wisconsin, up to 20 weeks or beyond if necessary to save the life or health of the mother, according to a
law passed in the 1980s
.
The ruling, the dissent and what's next
On Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled—along ideological lines—that the law does not ban abortion. The court has a 4-3 liberal majority, which it maintained after some
highly publicized and heavily funded elections
for its open seats in 2023 and 2025.
In its ruling, the majority found that the Wisconsin Legislature functionally repealed the 1849 law by later laws regulating abortion. ""We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion,"" writes the majority.
Sponsor Message
In a dissenting opinion, conservative Justice Annette Ziegler writes, ""the majority picks and chooses which abortion statutes remain in force,"" and calls the opinion ""a jaw-dropping exercise of judicial will.""
Last year,
the court accepted
a separate case from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin that argued the statute is a ban and that it's unconstitutional. Wednesday, though, justices dismissed that case because they could only get to the constitutional question if they ruled the law does ban abortion.
Planned Parenthood had posited that the 176-year-old law conflicts with the provisions in the state constitution establishing a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as well as equal protection. So, the constitutional question goes unresolved, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
""And so, I think there will be continued conversations about what constitutional protections we have in Wisconsin,"" says Godar. She says that could be future court cases or constitutional amendment ballot questions.
Right now, citizens
don't have a way
to initiate constitutional amendments via ballot measures in Wisconsin; only the Legislature can do that. Wisconsin currently has a divided government, made up of a GOP-controlled Legislature and a Democratic governor. So, it's unlikely that the legislature will initiate any ballot questions to establish constitutional protections for abortion within the next year or, conversely, that the Democratic governor would sign any additional bans into law.
But all this could change after the 2026 midterm elections in Wisconsin, when many state legislative seats and the governor's office will be up for grabs."

The tax and spending legislation the House voted to send to President Donald Trump's desk on Thursday, enacting much of his domestic agenda, cuts federal health spending by about $1 trillion over a decade in ways that will jeopardize the physical and financial health of tens of millions of Americans.
The bill,
passed in both the House and the Senate
without a single Democratic vote, is expected to reverse many of the health coverage gains of the Biden and Obama administrations. Their policies made it easier for millions of people to access health care and reduced the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows, though Republicans say the trade-off was far higher costs borne by taxpayers and increased fraud.
Sponsor Message
Under the legislation Trump is expected to sign on Friday, Independence Day, reductions in federal support for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause nearly 12 million more people to be without insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.
Politics
House Republicans pass Trump's megabill, sending the package to his desk to be signed
That in turn is expected to undermine the finances of hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers — which will have to absorb more of the cost of treating uninsured people. Some may reduce services and employees or close altogether.
Here are five ways the GOP's plan will affect health care access.
1. Many people will have to work to stay on Medicaid
The deepest cuts to health care spending come from a proposed Medicaid work requirement, which is expected to end coverage for millions of enrollees who do not meet new employment or reporting standards.
In 40 states and Washington, D.C., all of which have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child. The new requirement will start as early as January 2027.
The bill's requirement doesn't apply to people in the 10 largely GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to nondisabled adults.
Sponsor Message
Health researchers say the policy will have little impact on employment. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees who don't receive disability benefits already work or are looking for work, or are unable to do so because
they have a disability
, attend school, or care for a family member,
according to KFF
, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
State experiments
with work requirements have been plagued with administrative issues, such as eligible enrollees' losing coverage over paperwork problems, and budget overruns. Georgia's work requirement, which officially launched in July 2023, has cost more than $90 million, with
only $26 million
of that spent on health benefits, according to the
Georgia Budget & Policy Institute
, a nonpartisan research organization.
""The hidden costs are astronomical,"" said Chima Ndumele, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
2. Less cash means less care in rural communities
Belt-tightening that targets states could translate into fewer health services, medical professionals, and even hospitals, especially in rural communities.
The GOP's plan curtails a practice, known as
provider taxes
, that nearly every state has used for decades to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers and to private managed-care companies.
States often use the federal money generated through the taxes to pay the institutions more than Medicaid would otherwise pay. Medicaid generally pays lower fees for care than Medicare, the program for people over 65 and some with disabilities, and private insurance. But thanks to provider taxes, some hospitals are paid more under Medicaid than Medicare,
according to the Commonwealth Fund
, a health research nonprofit.
Hospitals and nursing homes say they use these extra Medicaid dollars to expand or add new services and improve care for all patients.
Rural hospitals typically operate on thin profit margins and rely on payments from Medicaid taxes to sustain them. Researchers from the
Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research
who examined the original House version of the bill concluded it would push more than 300 rural hospitals — many of them in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma —
toward service reductions or closure
.
Sponsor Message
Republicans in the Senate tacked a $50 billion fund onto the legislation to cushion the blow to rural hospitals. The money will be distributed starting in 2027 and continue for five years.
3. ACA coverage will become harder to get and keep
For those with Obamacare plans, the new legislation will make it harder to enroll and to retain their coverage.
ACA marketplace policyholders will be required to update their income, immigration status, and other information each year, rather than be allowed to automatically reenroll — something more than 10 million people did this year. They'll also have less time to enroll; the bill shortens the annual open enrollment period by about a month.
People applying for coverage outside that period — for instance because they lose a job or other insurance or need to add a newborn or spouse to an existing policy — will have to wait for all their documents to be processed before receiving government subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Today, they get up to 90 days of premium help during the application process, which can take weeks.
Republican lawmakers and some conservative policy think tanks, including
the Paragon Health Institute
, say the changes are needed to reduce fraudulent enrollments, while opponents say they represent Trump's
best effort to undo Obamacare
.
Interview highlights
Republicans' big bill could hit rural hospitals hard
The legislation also does not call for an extension of more generous premium subsidies put in place during the covid pandemic. If Congress doesn't act, those enhanced subsidies will expire at year's end, resulting in premiums rising by
an average of 75%
next year, according to KFF.
4. Those on Medicaid will pay more to see the doctor
Many Medicaid enrollees can expect to pay more out-of-pocket for appointments.
Trump's legislation requires states that have expanded Medicaid to charge enrollees up to $35 for some services if their incomes are between the federal poverty level (this year, $15,650 for an individual) and 138% of that amount ($21,597).
Sponsor Message
Medicaid enrollees often don't pay anything when seeking medical services because studies have shown charging even small copayments prompts low-income people to forgo needed care. In recent years, some states have added charges under $10 for certain services.

The paperwork trap: A sneaky way to cut Medicaid in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'?
The policy won't apply to people seeking primary care, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. The bill allows states to enact even higher cost sharing for enrollees who seek emergency room care for non-emergencies. But if Medicaid patients fail to pay, hospitals and other providers could be left to foot the bill.
5. Some immigrants will lose access to subsidized ACA plans
The GOP plan could cause at least hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are lawfully present — including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking, and refugees — to lose their ACA marketplace coverage by cutting off the subsidies that make premiums affordable. The restriction won't apply to green-card holders.
Because the immigrants who will lose subsidies under the legislation tend to be younger than the overall U.S. population, their exit would leave an older, sicker, and costlier population of marketplace enrollees, further pushing up marketplace premiums, according to marketplace directors in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and health analysts.
Taking health care access away from immigrants living in the country legally ""will do irreparable harm to individuals we have promised to protect and impose unnecessary costs on local systems already under strain,"" John Slocum, executive director of Refugee Council USA, an advocacy group, said
in a statement
.
The bill reflects the Trump administration's restrictive approach to immigration. But because it ran afoul of Senate rules, the legislation doesn't include a proposal that would have reduced federal Medicaid payments to states such as California that use their own money to cover immigrants without legal status.

The Trump administration is making an unprecedented reach for data held by states
The data transfer, which happened last month, was
first reported
by The Associated Press. Top Health and Human Services officials directed the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) to share data with DHS from California, Illinois, Washington and Washington, DC, about millions of their Medicaid recipients, according to the AP's report.
Those jurisdictions allow some low-income immigrants, including some without legal status, who do not qualify for Medicaid to access state-funded health programs.
States routinely must share extensive data about Medicaid enrollees with CMS, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, immigration status and healthcare information — but say that data is supposed to stay confidential.
The suit, which was filed in federal court in San Francisco, asks the court to stop HHS from sharing Medicaid data with any other federal agency and to stop DHS, any other federal agency, or the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from using the data for immigration enforcement or ""population surveillance.""
It also asks the court to order the ""impoundment, disgorgement, and destruction of all copies of any Medicaid data containing personally identifiable, protected health information that has already been unlawfully disclosed to DHS and DOGE.""
Bonta and almost all the other state attorneys general bringing the federal lawsuit are Democrats.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin sent NPR a statement that said, in part: ""CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""
The Department of Health and Human Services said it does not comment on litigation, but last month, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the data transfer was legal, and that CMS is ""aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants.""
""This oversight effort — supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS — is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse,"" Nixon said in the same statement. ""We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars — we are restoring credibility to one of America's most vital programs.""
All states, however, receive
emergency Medicaid funds

, a health policy researcher at UCLA and study co-author. ""For that small amount, we've been able to translate that into saving up to 90 million deaths around the world.""
Since USAID was formed in 1961, it's funded a wide range of programs, from giving school lunches to children in Haiti to distributing HIV medication across sub-Saharan Africa. While many studies have analyzed narrower slices of USAID's portfolio, including
maternal mortality
and
child health
, no peer-reviewed research had attempted to take stock of the agency's overall impact.
As the Trump administration started cutting programs, Macinko and researchers from Europe, South America and Africa got to work assessing just what USAID's impact has been.
""What we really tried to draw out was, how did the funding from USAID influence a set of outcomes?"" says Macinko. ""We were most interested in looking at mortality, to really be able to quantify the impact of these investments.""
The team analyzed demographic and death data from 133 different countries that received aid between 2001 and 2021. By comparing deaths across countries that received low, medium and high amounts of USAID aid — while accounting for differences in population, income, education and other non-aid factors — the team was able to estimate the human effects of that aid.
Sponsor Message
And those effects were substantial. They found that high levels of USAID funding were associated with a 15% reduction in deaths from any cause, across all ages. For children under five, the percentage more than doubled to 32%.
""Once you translate that 15% reduction into the number of lives, it actually represents 91million deaths averted,"" says Macinko. ""When we saw that number, we were indeed surprised.""
Digging into the data further revealed that USAID programs were associated with the biggest reductions in deaths from
HIV/AIDS
, malaria, and
neglected tropical diseases
such as dengue or chikungunya. Smaller, but still statistically significant reductions in mortality were seen for tuberculosis, nutritional deficiencies, diarrhoeal diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions and lower respiratory infections.
The Trump administration's abrupt and steep cuts to foreign aid have halted most of USAID's programs. To estimate how many lives could be affected by the dismantling of the agency going forward, the researchers used what they'd learned in the retrospective analysis to estimate how many preventable deaths might occur if the current USAID cuts become permanent. If that happens, they estimate that somewhere between 8 and 19 million people could die, including 4.5 million children, by 2030.
""Even if you take the most conservative estimate, these are still really significant in terms of lives lost,"" says Macinko.
A State Department official who briefed reporters said that ""these sorts of studies are based on incorrect assumptions about what Secretary Rubio intends to and has done to foreign assistance. I think he's been very clear that a lot of the life saving work that we do will continue and will be made more efficient.""
Overall, the study fills a major gap in providing a ""birds-eye view"" of USAID's impact, says
Brooke Nichols
, an infectious disease modeler at Boston University who wasn't involved in the study.
""I like their statistical approach, it was really well done and robust,"" she says, noting that analyzing the impact of so many programs across so many countries is challenging. Death data isn't perfect in many countries, which adds some uncertainty.
Sponsor Message
While USAID is often the biggest foreign aid donor, other nations and organizations also contribute. If contributions from other groups are correlated with USAID funding in a particular country, it could be hard to parse the specific impact of USAID, she says. Still, she praises the timeliness of the study.
""The value of the retrospective work is helpful to show the world what can be done with concerted effort, bipartisan support … to show just how much impact you can have,"" she says.
Putting numbers to the lives that could be lost if funding isn't restored does something very important, she says. It highlights the costs that policy decisions can have on human lives."

Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a pronouncement that stunned the global health world.
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance
— which has vaccinated more than
half the world's children
in many of the world's lowest-income countries — was hosting a major event to solicit donations for its global vaccination efforts. RFK Jr. decided to take the opposite stance. He said the U.S. would cut off more than a billion dollars that had previously been promised over the next few years. In a video, he slammed Gavi, saying ""it has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.""
Sponsor Message
His evidence: A
study
from 2017.
This study looked at children in the west African country of Guinea-Bissau who had been given the DTP vaccine — for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, three potentially fatal diseases.
Although DTP vaccines have been
credited with saving over 40 million
lives globally, the study claimed that children who received the vaccine were more likely to die than other children who had not yet received it.
What do we know about the study that RFK Jr. cited? And does it make a convincing case that Gavi has indeed neglected safety issues? To answer these questions, NPR interviewed top vaccine researchers — including some tasked with looking at the very issue raised by this study about the safety of the DTP vaccine.
What to know about the 2017 study?
The 2017 study was published in the peer-reviewed journal eBioMedicine, which is part of
The Lancet
, a highly regarded medical publication. The researchers looked at just over 1,000 children who received the DTP vaccine in the early 1980s.
The issue is not whether the DTP vaccine works. It is universally acknowledged to be highly effective at preventing these three deadly diseases.
Instead, the researchers behind the 2017 study were fascinated by a different issue: Did the DTP vaccine cause children to get sick and die from other causes?
Sponsor Message
Their study looked at infants between 3 and 6 months. It claimed that children who got the DTP vaccine — as well as the oral polio vaccine — around the age of 3 months were five times more likely to die before they turned 6 months compared to infants that had not yet received their vaccines. According to the study, of these children a few died of respiratory issues, a few of fever, a handful of diarrhea. Still others died of unknown causes.
RFK Jr. called the 2017 report a ""landmark study"" by ""five internationally revered deities of vaccine research, all of whom are strong vaccine proponents.""
Four are researchers in Denmark and the other is from Guinea-Bissau.
Dr. Christine Stabell Benn
and
Dr. Peter Aaby
— who is also an anthropologist — are the two authors who have
published
on this topic over the past 25 years. They did not respond to NPR's requests for interviews.
Vaccine experts interviewed by NPR point to several problems with the study:
First: The data is old — really old
While the study was published less than a decade ago, the data it relies on is from the early 1980s — more than 40 years ago.
""The study is based on ancient data,"" says
Dr. Beate Kampmann
, a vaccinologist and pediatrician who is the scientific director of the Centre for Global Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin — one of Europe's largest university hospitals.
""During that time, vaccines were not commonly used in the country, and the risk of death in infants was extremely high,"" explains
Dr. Kate O'Brien
, the director of the Department of Immunizations, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO.
Since then, the number of youngsters who die has dropped precipitously.
According to data from the
World Bank
, in 1984 in Guinea-Bissau, 244 kids died before their fifth birthday out of every 1,000 kids born. In 2023, that number had dropped to 69.
Sponsor Message
O'Brien says this means any findings from back then aren't very applicable to today's world.
Second: Two of the key researchers later came out with a different finding
Stabell Benn and Aaby — who published the 2017 paper — published another
paper in 2022
. It looked at the same west African country and the same vaccine but the data was more recent. This time their data was gathered between 2010 and 2014. And, in this study, they found ""no effects on all-cause mortality"" for kids who got the DTP vaccine compared to those who got it later.
NPR sent Health and Human Services a detailed list of questions about this study — as well as all the other concerns outside experts raised with the 2017 study. The HHS spokesperson did not respond to the specific questions but sent a statement via email reiterating what RFK Jr said in his video.
""Secretary Kennedy believes that global public health recommendations must not rely on assurances alone, but on continuous, independent review and rigorous debate,"" read part of the statement.
Third: The study methods are not ideal
Outside researchers who have looked at the 2017 study say there are a lot of gaps in the information provided in the study and that the methodology is challenging to understand.
The gold-standard in research is a randomized controlled trial, where study participants are randomly assigned to get the vaccine or get a placebo. That didn't happen here. Instead, the researchers simply observed what happened naturally.
This approach is problematic, says
Dr. Paul Offit
, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and previously a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He says you can imagine parents might seek out the vaccine if their kids seemed sickly. But perhaps if they were more sickly, they were more likely to die anyway.
Sponsor Message
""You have to control for things like socioeconomic background, medical background, health care seeking behavior — this study didn't control for those things,"" he says.
Also, Offit says, researchers usually put forward an explanation about how the vaccine might be causing these deaths. But, he says, the authors of this study did not offer any theories. ""What is your proposed mechanism?"" he asks.
Several outside experts said they had a very hard time understanding what the researchers actually did and how the data was analyzed. ""[The] statistical methods are all over the place,"" says Kampmann.
While author Stabell Benn did not respond to NPR's requests for an interview, in a 2019 TEDx Talk, she said, her results haven't been accepted by the medical community. ""I've spent literally years, I think, pulling out my hair and speculating why it's so difficult."" She blames the polarized vaccine debate, saying both sides don't want to consider data that runs counter to their stance.
Fourth:  Today's vaccines are different
Outside vaccine experts say it's important to note that the DTP vaccine that was given in the 1980s — and was in use during the data-gathering for 2017 study RFK Jr. cites — is not the same as the current version.
Today's DTP vaccines ""are made in a completely different way,"" says Kampmann, explaining that the
pentavalent vaccine
is widely used. This vaccine not only protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis but also hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b. So any possible consequences from that older vaccine would not be relevant today, she says.
Fifth: ""
If there was a problem, we would probably know it""
The researchers who did the 2017 study raised their concerns about the DTP vaccine as early as
2000.
Since then, outside experts have been looking into the issue and reassessing all the data.
The
Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety
— which was established by the World Health Organization but operates independent of WHO — urged WHO to test this DTP vaccine by looking at data gathered in other countries. Studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. By 2002 the studies were complete, and the conclusion was in.
Sponsor Message
""The studies showed no negative effect of DTP vaccination,"" according to a report of the GACVS's June meeting published in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record on November 22, 2002.
GACVS has a special task force look at the issue, reporting back
in 2004
, that DTP helped child survival and did not hurt it. It was again considered in
2008
and then,
in 2014
, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) — a group of independent experts that advises the WHO — took it up.
The 2017 study author, Stabell Benn, was on this SAGE panel of experts, as was O'Brien who is now at WHO. The experts looked at all the studies on this question of DTP causing unrelated health consequences. Almost half the studies they looked at were from the Guinea Bissau team. These study results were mixed — some found a negative effect and others did not — but what was consistent, the SAGE team found, was that the studies had ""
significant methodological limitations
.""
O'Brien says these groups kept reevaluating the data because they were open to new information but the conclusion kept being the same.
""We have billions of people who have been vaccinated [with a DTP-containing vaccine] ... For decades, generations, people have been receiving this vaccine. If there was a problem, we would probably know it right?"" she said. ""If we step back from vaccination, we will cause harm. It will result in deaths.""
""People like Kennedy then put their little poker in and pull out the very specific study that suits their agenda,"" says Kampmann, noting the RFK Jr. has spread inaccurate information about vaccines in the past.
The aftermath of the RFK Jr. announcement
RFK Jr. said that all financial contributions to Gavi would be paused and the organization needs ""to re-earn public trust.""
Global health specialists say the consequences of this decision could be huge.

""Of all the global health programs that have been cut, this will likely mean more deaths than any [other cut],"" said
Dr. Atul Gawande

""It's just a travesty,"" says Offit from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""There is probably no better public health organization, more effective public health organization, and, frankly, more economical public health organization than Gavi."""

A storied US agency, one that began under President Kennedy in 1961 with the aim of providing global stability through a wide array of humanitarian aid and development programs, has now formally closed.
Since January, the Trump administration has systematically dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID), canceling thousands of contracts and firing or placing on leave thousands of employees within the U.S. and overseas.
In a public statement
issued in early February, the U.S. State Department wrote that USAID ""has long strayed from its original mission of responsibly advancing American interests abroad, and it is now abundantly clear that significant portions of USAID funding are not aligned with the core national interests of the United States.""
IN 1961, President John F. Kennedy created USAID by executive order.

To course correct, Secretary of State Marco Rubio was appointed as Acting Administrator of USAID. And as of July 1, the remainder of the aid agency will be
absorbed
into the State Department.

NPR interviewed four former high level officials within USAID, including previous heads of the agency during both Democratic and Republican administrations, to reflect on this milestone event: Atul Gawande, Dean Karlan, Andrew Natsios and Susan Reichle.
Goats and Soda
Why Dean Karlan, chief economist of USAID, resigned this week
Reichle says that the reorganization amounts to ""an absolute train wreck"" and Natsios calls it ""an abomination.""
In addition, they all expressed concern that the State Department is not equipped to manage what's left of the agency's programming and staff. NPR reached out to the State Department for comment on the July 1 transition and this critique but did not receive a reply.
Andrew Natsios
, the USAID administrator from 2001 to 2006 under George W Bush, thinks it will take at least five to seven years to tee up the infrastructure needed to run the complex global aid programs once managed by the agency.
""I think the State Department's the finest diplomatic institution in the world,"" he says. ""However, it's not an aid institution. That's completely different."" And with
94% of the some 13,000 USAID
staff now laid off, Natsios questions how everything will be managed.
""Who is going to run this system?"" he asks. ""Santa Claus?""
The potential growth of famine
One of Natsios' areas of expertise is famine. Part of that interest is personal. His great uncle died during the famine in Greece that was brought on by the Nazi occupation and that wiped out at least 300,000 people.
Two boys eat from a discarded can they found in an Athens street during the Great Famine, the period of mass starvation during the Axis occupation of Greece in 1943. Andrew Natsios, the USAID administrator from 2001 to 2006 under George W Bush, expresses great admiration for the agency's work in relieving famine, noting that part of his interest is personal. His great uncle died during the famine in Greece.

Natsios explains that deaths due to famine have dropped over the last 40 years ""and that's because of the evolution of [the] humanitarian response system in the world, which is dominated by [USAID]."" Since the late 1980s, the agency has used its
Famine Early Warning Systems Network
to predict food emergencies and deployed its Disaster Assistance Response Team to manage the crises. Natsios says that at least a quarter of the $35 billion USAID budget has historically been allocated for disaster response, most of which was for food emergencies.

With the effective dissolution of the aid agency, he worries that hunger and famine — already on the
rise for six consecutive years
— may continue to grow with devastating consequences.
""During any famine, people start moving when they're dying. And where do they go? They go to countries that are rich where there's food,"" he says. ""The way to stop migration, which President Trump ran for election on, is you stop the reason why people are moving."" He argues that can be achieved by improving life in those places facing food insecurity, a task that he believes that USAID was designed to accomplish.
In January, Afghan men loaded sacks of flour into a car for transport, largely supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Trump Administration has since canceled all U.S. contracts supporting humanitarian aid for Afghanistan.

More broadly, instability forces people from their homes in search of something better despite the severe risk that migration involves. "" I think we don't have the tools anymore to deal with these crises because we just eliminated them all,"" says Natsios, referring to the USAID shutdown.
""So by letting the international system collapse, we're going to increase the pressure on our borders,"" he says. ""It's not what the President wanted, but that's what's going to happen. It's madness.""
The slow death of USAID
Dean Karlan, who served as USAID's Chief Economist from late 2022
until February of this year
, says that since President Trump's inauguration, the agency has been dying a slow death. The July 1 date simply confirms what many have known: ""USAID stopped being what it was several months ago,"" he says. Currently, 83% of the agency's programs
have been terminated
.
During his time at USAID, Karlan and his team were tasked with designing more cost-effective programs. He believes the State Department may be able to save lives in a manner similar to USAID. ""We're still waiting to see what they put in place,"" he says.
However, he says he has reason to be skeptical. ""The political appointees leading State have done nothing to figure out what's working and what's not in order to fund the things that are more effective,"" he says. ""Every indication and everybody I've been talking to is telling me that they are not putting those processes in place.""

Take child mortality. For decades, there's been a steady year over year decline globally in the number of deaths of children under the age of five due to improvements in public health and reductions in poverty. The UN Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation calculates that since 1990, the under-five mortality rate has fallen by
more than half
. But 2025 may be a turning point.
Sponsor Message
""This is probably going to be the first year in decades that more children under five globally died than in the prior year,"" says Karlan, who's not confident that the absorption of what remains of USAID into the State Department will alter that projection. That's because programs focused on food insecurity
have been canceled
, including all of the $114.5 million of awards to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and $108 million for the agency's Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security, along with ""food sitting in warehouses literally going bad,"" he says. ""That happened from the moment those stop work orders were put in place. So there's death that has happened that cannot obviously be reversed.""
In addition, USAID staffing has been decimated since January.
Susan Reichle
, who worked as a Senior Foreign Service Officer with USAID in Colombia, Haiti, Nicaragua and Russia, says that fewer than 6% of the agency's original employees — 718 people — will be transferring into the State Department.
These individuals will help run the remaining programs, which represent a small fraction of the thousands that USAID was once responsible for. But many of those programs may well sunset in September, says Reichle, because the State Department does not currently have the authority or capacity needed to extend those contracts.
So in her new role running the
Aid Transition Alliance
, an initiative to support the USAID community of current and former employees through mental health, communication and career transition services, she has been focused on celebrating the many aid workers who've worked at USAID over the decades. ""They have served heroically for this country,"" Reichle says. She points to their containment of the Ebola epidemic of West Africa that began in 2013. ""They prevented migrants from migrating across the Western hemisphere by giving them opportunities for education. And they have
saved 25 million lives
just with PEPFAR,"" a program credited with helping to prevent HIV-related deaths that was started by George W. Bush and co-administered by USAID.

Fighting fights
Natsios points to one potential upside of the reorganization — navigating interagency politics.
""State knows how to fight fights with the Treasury Department, the CIA, the Defense Department,"" he says. ""Usually, we're allied with them, but [State] wouldn't take our policies up as their first priority. They might do that now.""
Still, Natsios doesn't think this merits the evisceration of USAID.
""Privately, if you talk to the State people, they want to control what [USAID] did,"" he says. ""But they don't want to run it because they don't know how to do it.""
Karlan and Reichle have both welcomed critical reviews of foreign assistance in the past to improve the effectiveness of programs and personnel. This merger, says Karlan, ""is not inherently a bad thing,"" but the hasty manner in which it's happening isn't consistent with the spirit of those reviews.
Natsios says it would be as improbable as fusing two disparate corporations like Exxon and Microsoft. ""I'm not comparing State and [USAID] to either of those companies, but the cultures are completely different,"" he says. That mismatch has led him to predict a failure at such a scale that within five years, there will be a call for a new independent aid agency.
A possible rebirth out of heartbreak
Atul Gawande
, who led global health at USAID during the Biden administration, finds the demise of the foreign aid agency ""heartbreaking.""
""It's enabled us to have enormous impact and influence around the world,"" he says. ""It's arguably saved more lives per dollar than any other agency"" through disease prevention and eradication, stabilizing conflict, disaster response and international development.
He allows that the State Department will be able to carry on some of USAID's work, but it will be ""a fraction of the impact and leadership that we have been able to provide around the world."" And he worries that the aid efforts will become more politically oriented or inspired once they're no longer housed within an independent agency. (Though Karlan admits that politics has long been a force that seeps into foreign aid to some extent.)

Reichle calls 1 July a pivotal day. That's because it's also the date that the severance payments for many who have been laid off will stop, marking an official end to their tenure in government. ""We are losing people that have developed decades of experience in how to not just manage these really important life saving programs but also how to build trust with with our partners on the ground,"" she says.

""It will be too late to save USAID, but I do pray that we can save development,"" she adds. ""We're a very resilient community and development is not going away. It's not over.""
Gawande agrees. He has spoken with foreign aid professionals who have told him, ""Who knows, I might well have an opportunity to return to government. And even after all this, I would return again in a heartbeat — to be able to have this kind of impact in the world.""
He argues that the chaos and destruction emerging from the changes to USAID are not necessarily permanent. That's why he says, ""I have faith that this work will come back. I don't know if it'll take six months, two years, ten years. But this is work that humanity has been pursuing for decades, if not centuries, so we will come back to it.""
Still, Gawande acknowledges that USAID as the world knew it will never return. ""You can't rebuild that network built up over 60 years and destroyed in a matter of weeks,"" he says.
He pauses to reflect on what an appropriate epitaph for the foreign aid agency might be — to be chiseled on its tombstone on July 1.
""It lifted us up,"" Gawande says at last, ""our country and the world."""

Hormones for menopause are safe, study finds. Here's what changed
People experiencing perimenopause and menopause symptoms —
which can range from
hot flashes and night sweats to mood changes, decreased libido and cognitive issues — often complain of unresponsive doctors and inconsistent care. Symptoms can impact quality of life in the moment, and long-term health.
Many doctors are ill-equipped to handle these conversations.

A needs assessment published
in the medical journal
Menopause
in 2023 showed just under a third of the residency programs in obstetrics and gynecology it surveyed offered training on menopause, even though half of the population experiences it.
That's led lawmakers in California and nationally to try to intervene.
In California,  legislators introduced two bills this legislative session on menopause education for doctors.
Assembly Bill 360
, which would have required a state agency to look into education gaps and how to fill them, was tabled last month. But
Assembly Bill 432
, which would require menopause coursework for doctors to renew their licenses — if at least 25% of their patients are women under 65 — is still moving through the legislature.
""It reflects my own experience having to go to three doctors before a doctor could adequately have a conversation with me about menopause,"" said Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who introduced the measure.
She says when she was going through menopause, her brain fog became so intense that she worried she might have early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Sponsor Message
And California's  efforts are part of a national trend.
""Thirteen states, including California, have introduced a total of 21 bills [related to menopause] this legislative session, which is pretty stunning actually for an issue that really wasn't on any legislator's radar, certainly three years ago,"" said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, who runs the Birnbaum Women's Leadership Center at New York University and
tracks menopause bills
.
Several of those bills also touch on doctor education. In New Jersey, for example,
one bill would allow
providers to use continuing education credits toward their license renewal.
Arizona
and
Massachusetts
introduced bills this year to provide more information on menopause to providers and patients.
In recent years,
Illinois
and
Louisiana
have started to mandate insurance coverage for some menopause treatments.
Treating symptoms instead of letting patients endure them
Training is available for doctors who want it — and treatments are available for people who need them.
""There's no reason that somebody should suffer with those symptoms,"" said Dr. Monica Christmas from the University of Chicago. She runs the menopause program at the Center for Women's Integrated Health.
Christmas, who has practiced gynecology for over 20 years, fell into the specialty because her colleagues kept sending her their menopausal patients.
""I didn't know the answers, but I listened,"" she said.
After hearing their concerns, she researched their symptoms before coming back with treatment ideas. They, in turn, told their friends at work, over coffee, and while waiting for the train about the doctor who took them seriously.
""And so very quickly, I got super busy,"" she said.
Christmas said the training a school offers on menopause usually depends on how well-resourced it is. Since few schools have a robust program, many physicians also seek out information and training elsewhere.
Christmas also works for
The Menopause Society
— a national organization that provides training for doctors on how to treat women at this stage of life.
Sponsor Message
Christmas said it's imperative that doctors know how to work with lots of different people — because symptoms vary, and so do people's tolerance levels and trust in the medical system.
""Black women like myself were very reluctant to take anything for the symptoms that they were experiencing,"" she said. She never understood why and heard myriad reasons when she asked. Some patients explained that menopause is simply a natural process meant to be endured. ""Yet, I could see in front of me them having hot flashes in the conversation.""
Specialized care for Black women
Kim Robinson, with the advocacy organization Black Women for Wellness, said Black women have to
navigate discrimination
on top of seeking helpful information from health care providers.
She added that doctors should be better versed in how Black women experience this time of life differently from other women.
For instance, Black women often experience fibroids, or benign growths in the uterus, at higher rates than white women, according to a
recent study
in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
As they reach menopause, Robinson said
many doctors suggest Black women get hysterectomy
, which is the removal of the uterus, without fully explaining the risks or alternatives.
According to the Mayo Clinic
, several alternatives exist, such as hormone regulation, but nearly 60% of women who receive a hysterectomy are offered other treatment first.
""It's not just this one invasive thing, remove your parts and the problem is solved,"" she said of the procedure.
Robinson knows from experience. When her doctor suggested she get a hysterectomy, she knew to push back and ask questions, eventually finding a less-invasive alternative.
But, she said, the burden shouldn't be on patients to advocate for themselves. Doctors, she said, should get more training and education on symptoms and treatments.
Challenges to passing a menopause education law
In California, the measure that would require doctors to study menopause builds off a bill that Democratic
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed
last year. In his veto message, Newsom said the bill was ""too far-reaching"" because it would have required health insurance plans to cover expensive and non-FDA-approved treatments.

However, Newsom encouraged lawmakers to ""continue to work towards a more tailored solution that can improve access to perimenopause and menopause care, inform patients of their options, and encourage providers to stay informed of the latest clinical care recommendations,"" he wrote.
But Bauer-Kahan, the assemblymember, kept the provisions that Newsom cited as a problem. However, she added education requirements, when last year's bill strictly focused on insurance.
""We've doubled down,"" she said. ""I think one of the things I learned last year through the hearings we held on menopause and this work is how little is understood about menopause.""
Newsom's office declined to comment on the measure.
Opposition within the medical field is also an obstacle.
Dr. Tanya Spirtos, former president of the California Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the bill is well-intentioned but misguided. Doctors generally know they must stay up to date and informed about the latest treatments, she said.
""We do the reading and the education, as I say, to stay one step ahead of our patients,"" she said.
Spirtos, a gynecologist, also said there are lots of areas — like diabetes or nutrition — where doctors need to stay current, but requiring training in each one would create too much of a burden. She said doctors should decide for themselves what kind of training is most relevant to their practice.
""Every area that touches on bones or brain or heart or vagina or hot flashes has literature available that's really easy for our physicians to get a hold of and educate themselves,"" she said.
NYU's Weiss-Wolf's says she hopes to see access to good menopause care take off. Her focus on women's health also includes advocating for making tampons and pads more accessible.
""Certainly when I started working on periods, people weren't talking about it in any sort of public and systematic way,"" she said. ""And I would say that 10 years later, that feels different to me.""

The massive budget bill that Senate Republicans are debating pays for some of its tax cuts by slashing hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending. The latest report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates nearly 12 million people will lose health insurance if the Senate version of the bill becomes law.
Trump insists the cuts come from eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. Democrats have said they break Trump's promise not to touch Medicaid — and over the weekend, Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina agreed. ""What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding's not there anymore?""
We asked Sarah Jane Tribble, the chief rural correspondent for KFF Health News, what the cuts will mean for rural residents of states like North Carolina — and the hospitals that serve them.

People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer.
More than two decades after researchers first
demonstrated
that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the
brain-computer interface
(BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product.
""We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready,"" says Michael Mager, the CEO of
Precision Neuroscience
. ""It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives.""
Sponsor Message
Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet.
Treatments
This new brain-mapping device could make neurosurgery safer
Elon Musk's
Neuralink
is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision,
Blackrock Neurotech
,
Paradromics
, or
Synchron
.
Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or
generate artificial speech
.
Neuralink's 'telepathy'
Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word.

Brain Implant Restores Sense Of Touch To Paralyzed Man
A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate.
""Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts,"" says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink.
The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability ""telepathy.""

Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis.

Researchers work to create a sense of touch in prosthetic limbs
A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device.
A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the
Barrow Neurological Institute
in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull.
A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California,
describing
his experience controlling a computer cursor.
""It's freakin' wild,"" he said. ""When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it.""
Science
Scientists recreate a pathway that senses pain, using nerve cells grown in a dish
A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X.
But the success was tempered by Neuralink's
announcement
a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had ""retracted,"" making the device less sensitive.
Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant.
A new technology, decades old
While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't.
Treatments
Can this nasal spray slow down Alzheimer's? One couple is helping scientists find out
Dr. Leigh Hochberg
— who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004.
Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull.
A research
video
from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email.
""It was exactly what was supposed to happen,"" Hochberg says. ""And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there.""
Sponsor Message
Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment.
BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis
reported
that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer.
""I. Am. Good,"" the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking.
Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says.
Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet.
Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity ""more accurately, more consistently and more reliably,"" Hochberg says.
In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate.
The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs.
There are even groups ""focused on putting information back into the brain,"" Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand.
Fingers that feel
The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface.
""You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone,"" says
Jennifer Collinger
, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way.""
With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling.
Sponsor Message
So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people.
One of those people is
Nathan Copeland
, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama.
Shots - Health News
Scientists Bring The Sense Of Touch To A Robotic Arm
In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand.
""With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact,"" Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. ""I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not.""
But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago.
""There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'"" Collinger says.
One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by
Ben Rapoport
, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink.
Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer.
""We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel,"" Mager says. ""If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work.""
Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain.
""We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain,"" Mager says.
Sponsor Message
That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA.
Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries.
All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says.
""We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous,"" he says.
It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data.
Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says.
Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product.
That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three."

Vincent Feuray/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images
PARIS — A restrictive
outdoor smoking ban
has come into force in France, a country where café culture, which often includes a glass of wine and a cigarette, is a way of life.
As of Sunday, smokers are no longer allowed to light up in public parks, at swimming pools, or at beaches, or ""anywhere children may be present,"" said French health and family minister Catherine Vautrin, who pushed for the ban.
Violators can face fines ranging from the equivalent of around $150 to several hundred dollars.
""Tobacco must disappear from places where there are children,"" said Vautrin. ""A park, a beach, a school — these are places to play, learn, and breathe. Not for smoking.""
Sponsor Message
Smoking is also prohibited within about 30 feet of schools, libraries, bus stops, and any other place where the government says it could hurt minors. The health ministry said it would soon reveal signs to designate such areas. Vautrin called it another step ""towards a tobacco-free generation,"" which she said France is targeting for 2032.

After 40 years of smoking, she survived lung cancer thanks to new treatments
A poll
out in May showed
that 68% of French are for tighter restrictions on smoking in public, and even bans at outdoor cafés and restaurants, which are exempt under the current ban.
Supporters included 29-year-olds Maya Martin and Joe Camara, who were sitting in the grass in a Paris park, talking and smoking the day before the ban went into effect.
""I think this is a good thing because it's not good to smoke around children,"" said Martin. ""That's why we're sitting away from all the kids, because otherwise we won't be a good example for them.""
Both said they started smoking at university because of stress and because it was what everybody did. ""Yeah, I started in the context of drinks and coffees at cafés,"" said Camara.
Both said they are planning to quit, though Martin said it might be hard. ""A glass of wine and a cigarette at a café, that's kind of part of French culture,"" she laughed. ""It's a mood and yeah, maybe that's why I started to smoke.""

The French government banned smoking inside restaurants and bars in 2008 and has raised the price of cigarettes over the years in an effort to reduce smoking. Today a pack costs around $15. But this is the most restrictive outdoor ban ever to be enacted.
Global Health
Tobacco use is going down globally, but not as much as hoped, the WHO says
Smoking rates have come down in recent decades. About 23% of French adults smoke every day,
according to government data
from 2023. Though that is twice as high as the smoking rate among American adults, which was
11.6% in 2022
, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Smoking and smoking-related diseases kill 75,000 people in France every year, and cost French society the equivalent of more that $180 billion annually, says
the OFDT
(l'Observatoire francais des drogues et des tendances addictives) a French addiction observation group.
The new law does not include e-cigarettes. Critics say this defangs the measure, as
e-cigarette companies attract young people
with different flavored vapes.
As the ban came into effect on a broiling hot Sunday, adults and children splashed away in a lake in the Burgundy village of Pont-et-Massène. Jeremy Brigon watched from the beach. The 69-year-old no longer smokes, but he thinks this law is excessive.
""It's too much,"" says Brigon. ""People shouldn't smoke near schools, but there's enough room on a beach for people to be able to smoke.""
Leila Guitry and Frank Chauvin were puffing away on their towels despite the ban. They say they knew nothing about it because they're too busy working and don't have time to watch the news. The 22- and 25-year-olds say they've both smoked since they were 16. And they're absolutely against the measure. ""We're outside and there's enough room to be able to smoke,"" says Guitry.
But what about influencing young people?
""It's always been like that,"" she says. ""Kids see people smoking. My parents smoke and I smoke now. That's the way it is."""

This year, more than
2 million Americans
will hear the scary words: ""You have cancer.""
Let's say it's someone you know. You may be wondering, What's the best thing to do or say? … Or
not
say?
All too often survivors and advocates say even well-intentioned people get some fundamentals wrong.
People might, for example, want to put a happy face on the bad news, or try to connect by offering stories of others with cancer — which can feel irrelevant or hurtful, says Kara Kenan, a spokesperson for the
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship
, who recovered from her own bout with breast cancer a dozen years ago.

""The number one complaint is when other people who are well-meaning and sharing, 'I know what you're going through; my grandmother had cancer … and, oh, by the way, she died,'"" Kenan says.
Life, after diagnosis
'Cancer ghosting' can be more painful than treatment, survivors say
What's worse though, is when people disappear without a word, perhaps because they
don't
know how to respond. Chelsey Gomez, a 7-year survivor of Hodgkin's lymphoma from Deland, Fla., experienced this with some of her closest friends and even the younger brother she doted on.
""I cried more about that than the cancer a lot of times because I just felt so alone,"" she says.
The phenomenon is so common that many cancer patients call it ""
cancer ghosting,
"" and several cancer survivors told NPR was more painful than the treatments themselves.
Explore
Life, after diagnosis,
a series on living with cancer today.
So what are some good rules of thumb for those trying to be supportive without inadvertently adding to the person's burdens?
Here is some advice compiled from some
patient advocates, doctors and survivors:
Do reach out
People often feel especially tongue-tied responding to someone's cancer diagnosis, in part because they're afraid to intrude or offend, or because it raises old trauma or new scary possibilities:
What if they die? Could I get cancer?
Life, after diagnosis
More young people are surviving cancer. Then they face a life altered by it
""All of these feelings come up for people and they don't know how to deal with it, so how they deal with it is running away,"" says social worker
Carissa Hodgson
, who directs community support programs at
Bright Spot Network
, a support group for parents with cancer. It's important to manage those anxieties and recognize that every experience is individual.
Maria Fabrizio for NPR
And remember, if it's scary for you as the friend or family member, recognize the person with cancer is facing a bigger fear. And they need connection and presence – even if you don't know what to say, just being there makes a difference, many experts and survivors say.
Kenan, the spokesperson for the cancer survivors group, was 35 and a newlywed with a 4-year old daughter when breast cancer reordered her life. Some friends disappeared, but others stepped up, she says.
Sponsor Message
""Friends from my childhood, from my adult life, from all over the country at different times reached out, and for me that made a huge difference,"" she says, in terms of keeping her from feeling somewhat normal, or at least not alone.
In fact, social isolation is one of the most common,
underappreciated side effects
of having cancer, and can affect not only a person's mental health, but their ability to fight disease.
Ask and listen instead of talking
It can feel very difficult and scary, broaching the topic of someone's diagnosis, says Kenan, which might be why some people opt to disappear.
Knowing the person can help guide you in understanding how they generally might handle difficult topics. But if not, or if it still feels awkward, Kenan says it's best to acknowledge the tension and simply
ask
whether the patient
wants
to talk about it. If they do, she says, just listen: Allow them space to vent.
Life, after diagnosis
Her cancer diagnosis made motherhood both harder and more sweet
""Be prepared to be there if they
do
want to talk about it,"" she says, which may mean sitting with their pain, anxiety, sadness or any other uncomfortable emotions that the person might express –
without
offering commentary or comparison.
She says, simply: ""That sucks"" suffices, she says, as a response that conveys uncomplicated sympathy and understanding.
""There's a difference between listening to respond, and listening to just listen,"" says Kenan who, a dozen years later, is cancer free and lives in Wilmington, N.C.. She now teaches others how to communicate and support cancer patients by teaching professional courses for ""cancer coaches,"" who help patients navigate various aspects of life during and after treatment.
Skip the comparisons and platitudes
Sympathetic people often want to convey their understanding by sharing their own stories or unsolicited advice, Kenan says, but that can feel like you're overlooking the person and the particulars of their experience. Peoples' experiences of cancer varies a great deal, so bringing up stories of others is not only irrelevant, it could stoke fears for the patient.
Maria Fabrizio for NPR
Kenan acknowledges it is uncomfortable to hear someone you care about having a hard time, and there is a natural impulse to want to make it feel better. But offering rosy platitudes like ""you'll beat this"" might land entirely the wrong way.
""It makes me feel like some of the darker stuff that I'm dealing with inside isn't OK,"" Kenan says. She could sense the person's eagerness to white-wash her pain, which made her feel more alone dealing with a situation.
Sponsor Message
Sometimes she wanted distraction, and to feel normal again, she says, but she also needed friends she knew could help her process the most difficult emotions.
Be specific in your offers of help
""Let me know if I can do anything to help,"" is one of the most common, well-meaning responses upon learning of a person's hardship, but it's actually not very helpful, because it leaves the burden on the patient to either ask, or to think up a list of ways the person can help, says oncologist
Arif Kamal
, chief patient officer with the
American Cancer Society
.
""Showing up in really specific, practical ways and knowing what you're willing to do and just offering that, you're way more likely to get someone to take you up on that than if you just say, 'Let me know how I can help,'"" Kenan says.
Food is a great example of a favor that can go wrong. Imagine: Five friends might show up the same day with lasagnas in trays that must then be washed and returned. Lasagna might not meet the dietary requirements of the patient, or perhaps their kids don't like it.
""I'm picking up a pizza for my family, do you still like pepperoni and could I drop one off,"" is a much more specific offer that requires little response or coordination can be far more effective, Kamal says. It also opens the door for the person to come up with an alternative: ""Not tonight, thank you, but next Tuesday would be lovely.""
Maria Fabrizio for NPR
In some cases, technology can be of assistance. Kamal says the American Cancer Society is looking into developing an app-based system that will allow cancer patients to connect with neighbors willing to volunteer to help them, by driving them to appointments, for example, or babysitting children so they can rest.
Kenan says she loves apps like
Meal Train
that allow users to select from a menu of dietary needs, preferred delivery times and methods, so families get exactly what they need.
Sponsor Message
Keep up support after treatment ends
More people are surviving cancer because of better medicine. But Kenan says it's important to remember that side effects and other challenges can persist long after the cancer clears.
Living Better
Diagnosed with 'dense breasts'? You may need more than a mammogram
""Everybody celebrates, they ring a bell,"" she says, of the typical fanfare in treatment centers to mark the end of treatment. ""Everybody's like, 'Yes! You beat it!,' and then they go back to their normal lives. And that survivor is like: 'This isn't over for me.' Their whole life has changed and they are going to continue to need support.""
Continued support, however, does not necessarily mean meal trains have to continue indefinitely; often it just means remembering to honor how cancer left its mark. Many survivors say they need to continue to be able to talk about their experience, or process how it affected them.
Kenan says one of her favorite forms of support comes from friends who tell her that they got their cancer screenings, or who continue to advocate for research.
""That is so powerful to me as the survivor to see other people stepping up for their own health and stepping up for others,"" she says. That feels to her like love."

Kraft Heinz to remove artificial dyes from all products, like Jell-O and Kool-Aid
Smucker said the majority of its products — including its Uncrustables sandwiches — are already free of synthetic dyes. But some products still have them, including sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings.
Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.
Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands — the parent company of Duncan Hines — both said they would phase out synthetic dyes.

And perhaps the only homes their parents have ever known, he said. ""Most of the deportees have lived in Pakistan for over three decades. A large majority of them have nowhere to go and no place to call home upon return.""

Similar scenes are unfolding at the western borders that Afghanistan shares with Iran. Social media has featured images of men walking with bags of their belongings — everyday items like blankets and kitchenware.
The reasons for the waves of deportations aren't fully clear. Representatives of the two country governments did not respond to an NPR request for comments.
One explanation is that the governments want to remove those immigrants who do not have proper documentation.
On June 7, Fatemeh Mohajerani, an Iranian
government spokesperson, told local media
: ""The government differentiates between legal and illegal residents. The decision is that those with valid legal documents will be allowed to stay in accordance with the law, while those without legal documents may leave.""
The deportations reflect a growing anti-immigrant sentiment worldwide, says Teresa Casale, executive director of
Mina's List
, a human rights organization working on resettlement and advocacy for Afghan women refugees. And the U.S. crackdown on immigrants under Trump makes it more difficult if not impossible for Afghan refugees in other countries to resettle in the United States.
And the Afghan refugees in Pakistan have no real rights to protect them. ""It's so unfortunate that Pakistan is not a signatory to any kind of international refugee protocols or conventions, so obtaining legal status for refugees there is virtually impossible,"" Casale added.
""In the worst-case scenario, more than three million people could be forced to return to Afghanistan by the end of 2025,"" said Jacopo Caridi, country director of Norwegian Refugee Council in Afghanistan.
A bad time to go back
One thing is clear to advocates: The timing couldn't be worse.
Afghans are returning to a country suffering a humanitarian crisis, which has grown more dire since the Taliban seized power more than three years ago.
""Afghanistan is a humanitarian crisis unto itself,"" says Ibrahim of the IRC. ""There are 23 million people in need.""
Sponsor Message
Millions of Afghans are unable to purchase food
and rely on charity to get by. But aid groups, including the U.N.'s World Food Programme,
scaled down their activities
after the Trump administration initially pulled back most aid that it had designated for Afghanistan, including for food and basic medical care. Aid from the U.S. amounted to just over 40% of all funding that reached Afghanistan.
In February and March, other major aid donors,
including the U.K.,
also announced they were curtailing their foreign aid budgets, forcing charities to curtail their activities in Afghanistan, which is among the world's most reliant countries on international donors. This year, foreign donors have only pledged 20% of what humanitarian groups say they need to offer basic services to Afghanistan, according to Caridi.
Then in early April, all U.S. humanitarian aid to Afghanistan was eliminated. The canceled contracts totaled $280 million with the World Food Programme, $24 million with the United Nations Population Fund and $257 million with other nongovernmental organizations.
What returnees face
Needs will not be met, says Ibrahim: ""The surge of numbers means that very few people are going to be getting the immediate support that they need.""
Many of the returnees are women on their own. She says: ""I've met women who've said to me, I've been separated from my family. I have nowhere to go. I can't walk around Afghanistan or travel to a community of origin because I don't have a mahram, which is the male companion — a blood relative who is a male.""
As families return to Afghanistan, aid workers say they expect to see a rise in child labor. Many of the deported families are headed by women — the Taliban does not allow them to work in most professions so ""families rely on children to earn a living,"" said Safi Nurzai, who also works at the Afghan aid group Aseel.

If the female heads of family can't work, Nurzai said, the children will try and earn money by cleaning cars on the streets or selling tissue paper and pens. Nurzai adds that the kids are ""often pushed into begging for survival.""

Health departments around the country have noticed there's something strange happening with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: It's not showing up on schedule and there's been no communication about why.
The federal public health agency doles out
most of the money
it receives from Congress to state and local health departments, which then contract with local organizations. That's how public health work gets funded in the U.S.
According to two CDC staff members with knowledge of the agency's budget, the CDC has yet to receive its full funding for the 2025 fiscal year. NPR agreed not to name the staff members because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Former CDC staff warn of 'a five-alarm fire'
Both CDC staffers say the funding is now months late, and it will soon be too late to disperse the agency's grants that local health departments are waiting on. In the interim, the CDC has been operating with just 30-days of funding at a time. The staffers say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding. One of them called it ""rescission by inertia.""
The Department of Health and Human Services did not answer NPR's questions for this story or respond to a request for comment on that characterization.
A big change from the usual process
""Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC,"" says
Dr. Scott Harris
, who runs Alabama's health department and is the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. ""Less than 10% of our money comes from state dollars.""
""Nothing really can happen if we don't know that we're going to get the money — if there's no notice of award,"" Harris explains.
This year, the CDC's notices of award are just not arriving on schedule. ""For example, one of our cardiovascular grants expires at the end of this month,"" he says ""We don't have any notice of award, so it's really risky for us to incur a bunch of costs over the next several weeks doing work in this program, not knowing if we have the ability to get reimbursed.""

Harris says he's heard from state health departments across the country who are in the same situation with CDC funding being mysteriously delayed.

Grants related to HIV prevention work in many states expired at the end of May with no information about future funding. In Ohio, that meant the state's HIV hotline and the delivery of free test-at-home-kits were
abruptly halted
. The San Antonio AIDS Foundation had to
pause its testing services
. And in Charlotte, North Carolina, the funding delays led to job losses at the local health department, explains Mecklenburg County Health Commissioner
Raynard Washington
.
""The majority of those six people that we sent home at the beginning of June were disease investigation specialist staff — contact tracers for HIV, syphilis and other STIs,"" Washington says, referring to sexually transmitted infections.
""The result on the ground is that our other staff that we have that do that work have to take on more workload, and then very often we end up getting behind,"" he says. Getting behind could mean that people who have potentially been exposed to something don't know it, he adds. ""The ultimate risk is that they are also then exposing other people and then the chain just continues from there to grow.""
Funding for more grants will expire soon, says
Dr. Philip Huang
, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. Huang says the state health department just warned them that if they don't receive notices of award for some immunization and emergency preparedness grants they would have to pause the activities funded by those grants.
""[That] is extremely distressing to us because we have like 60 staff on those grants and significant funding that are affected,"" he says.
Washington adds that North Carolina has not received a new notice of award for the
breast and cervical cancer screening program
either.

The CDC is operating with an ""eyedropper"" monthly budget
In March, President Trump signed a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which included $9 billion for the CDC.
""Once [a budget] is passed and signed by the president, there is always a lag,"" explained one of the CDC staff members who spoke to NPR who is a senior leader at the agency. There's an ""apportionment"" process to give each agency its money, which usually takes between 45 and 60 days.
During this period, to be able to make payroll and keep up with regular bills, the CDC is given money in 30-day increments.
This year? ""Forty-five days came and went. Sixty days came and went, more and more time came and went — no word, no information,"" the CDC senior leader explains. ""We keep asking — where's our money? Where's the money that's been approved by Congress?""
Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC can't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to continue their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.
Month after month of funding in 30-day increments is like receiving money ""with an eyedropper,"" the senior leader adds.
HHS did not answer NPR's questions about the reasons for these funding delays at the CDC by publication time.
The staffers at the CDC say they are running out of time to be able to spend the agency's 2025 funds before the end of the fiscal year in September because of all the steps involved in getting funding out the door.
""The money just doesn't flow from one account or the other — people have to actually do the manual work of connecting the funds that are provided to the actual accounts at the appropriate levels,"" the other CDC staffer explains.

""If they can delay until the end of September, then that's it,"" the staffer adds. ""Those projects are not going to happen. That money goes straight back to Treasury.""
That's why both CDC staffers who spoke with NPR say this amounts to impounding the agency's funding.

More than 400 CDC staff may be called back to work after being laid off in April
""At this point, it is absolutely our assumption that it is being done intentionally to grind us to a halt,"" the senior leader says.
HHS did not respond to a request for comment on that characterization.
HIV funds showed up late, but uncertainty remains
This week, state health departments received word that the
End the HIV Epidemic
grants that expired at the end of May were finally being awarded.
There was no explanation for the delay, says Washington, the health commissioner in Charlotte, N.C.
""Now I have to go figure out if the staff that we laid off are willing to come back to work,"" he says. ""If they're not willing, then we have to start hiring, have to train — we've lost months of work because of administrative delays.""
And the delays continue, he says. There's been no communication about what might happen with the many grants that expire on Monday, as June ends. ""Throughout this experience, we've just been told, 'We don't have any answers,'"" he says. ""That's the hard part when you're trying to plan.""
Harris of Alabama agrees. ""We have to get paid to do these things, whether it's tobacco prevention or diabetes work or public health preparedness or whatever it is,"" he says. ""We can't really do it without the funding."""

The Supreme Court on Friday
upheld a key provision of the
Affordable Care Act
, ensuring, at least for now, that some 150 million people will continue getting many free, preventive services under the act.
The vote was 6-3, with Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh joining the court's three liberal justices in the majority.
Siding with the government on Friday,
the court upheld
the
Affordable Care Act
, allowing the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to continue determining which services will be available free of cost to Americans covered by the Affordable Care Act.
Sponsor Message
At issue in the case was a lawsuit that sought to undo the preventive care provision by challenging the appointment process for members of a 16-person task force that determines which preventive services are to be provided for free under insurance policies. Two lower courts found that the appointments were unconstitutional, but on Friday, the Supreme Court disagreed.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Kavanaugh said the Department of Health and Human Services has the power to appoint members of the task force.
Law
Supreme Court limits nationwide injunctions in birthright citizenship order
""Task Force members are supervised and directed by the Secretary, who in turn answers to the President, preserving the chain of command in Article II,"" Kavanaugh wrote.
The ACA's preventive treatments have benefited millions of people since the health care law went into effect 11 years ago — a sufficiently long time for most people to take the free coverage for granted. Activists argued that if the court ruled for the groups challenging the law, the benefits could disappear.
Friday's case arose when the preventive care task force classified pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs as essential to preventing HIV. Preventive PrEP coverage under the ACA includes not only HIV testing and medication, but also clinic visits and lab testing without added cost-sharing. Without ACA coverage, PrEP care would be astronomically expensive for most Americans.
Sponsor Message
The suit was brought by individuals and businesses with religious objections to the PrEP mandate—they claimed that providing PrEP coverage encourages
""sexual behaviors and drug use""
antithetical to their Christian beliefs.
Braidwood Management, the case's named plaintiff, is led by Republican mega donor Steven Hotze who has referred to members of the LGBTQ+ community at different times as
""morally degenerate,"" ""satanic,"" and ""termites.""
Hotze, has challenged the ACA in at least two other federal lawsuits.
The court's decision on preventive care likely will protect other existing preventive services under ACA, including treatment for blood pressure screenings, as well as birth control, breast and lung cancer screenings, immunizations, and more.
Prior to the court's decision on Friday, proponents of the ACA's existing preventive coverage had worried that without it, the financial burden of out-of-pocket expenses for these services would have discouraged people from getting care to prevent or detect disease at an early and treatable stage.
""I cannot think of another health policy that impacts more Americans than the preventive services provision,""
said
Dr. Mark Fendrick, a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Michigan.
Two lower courts in Texas found that the government violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its task force members were appointed not by the president, but by the secretary of Health & Human Services.

What does a 2nd Trump term mean for the Affordable Care Act?
The Supreme Court, however, disagreed, declaring that the task force was not composed of principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Rather, the court said, the advisory panel is composed of ""inferior officers,"" who may be appointed by a department head if that power is designated by Congress. Moreover, as the government pointed out in its briefs, the task force members are directly supervised by the HHS secretary, and members can be terminated at will."

CLARKESVILLE, Ga. — Last September, Alton Fry went to the doctor concerned he had high blood pressure. The trip would result in a prostate cancer diagnosis.
So began the stress of trying to pay for tens of thousands of dollars in treatment — without health insurance.
""I've never been sick in my life, so I've never needed insurance before,"" said Fry, a 54-year-old self-employed masonry contractor who restores old buildings in the rural Appalachian community he's called home nearly all his life.
Making sure he had insurance was the last thing on his mind, until recently, Fry said. He had been rebuilding his life after a prison stay, maintaining his sobriety, restarting his business, and remarrying his wife. ""Things got busy,"" he said.

Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
Now, with a household income of about $48,000, Fry and his wife earn too much to qualify for Georgia's limited Medicaid expansion. And he said he found that the health plans sold on the state's Affordable Care Act exchange were too expensive or the coverage too limited.
In late April, a friend launched a crowdfunding campaign to help Fry cover some of the costs. To save money, Fry said, he's taking a less aggressive treatment route than his doctor recommended.
""There is no help for middle-class America,"" he said.
More than 26 million Americans
lacked health insurance
in the first six months of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The uninsured are mostly low-income adults under age 65, and people of color, and most live in the South and West. The uninsured rate in the 10 states that, like Georgia, have not expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults was 14.1% in 2023, compared with 7.6% in expansion states,
according to KFF
, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Health policy researchers expect the number of uninsured to swell as the second Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress try to enact policies that explicitly roll back health coverage for the first time since the advent of the modern U.S. health system in the early 20th century.
Politics
Medicaid changes don't meet Senate rules in 'big, beautiful bill' says parliamentarian
Under the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" — budget legislation that would achieve some of President Donald Trump's priorities, such as extending tax cuts mainly benefiting the wealthy — some 10.9 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034,
according to estimates
by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based on a House version of the budget bill.
A Senate version of the bill could result in more people losing Medicaid coverage with reductions in federal spending and rules that would make it harder for people to qualify. That
bill suffered a major blow Thursday
when the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber's rules, rejected several health provisions — including the proposal to gradually reduce provider taxes, a mechanism that nearly every state uses to increase its federal Medicaid funding.
Sponsor Message
The number who could lose  insurance could rise to 16 million if proposed rule changes to the ACA take effect and tax credits that help people pay for ACA plans expire at the end of the year,
according to the CBO
. In KFF poll results released in June, nearly two-thirds of people surveyed
viewed the bill unfavorably
and more than half said they were worried federal funding cuts
would hurt their family's ability
to obtain and afford health care.
Like Fry, more people would be forced to pay for health expenses out-of-pocket, leading to delays in care, lost access to needed doctors and medications, and poorer physical and financial health.
""The effects could be catastrophic,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Policy-ish
How Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' threatens access to Obamacare
A patchwork system
The House-passed bill would represent the largest reduction in federal support for Medicaid and health coverage in history, Tolbert said. If the Senate approves it, it would be the first time Congress moved to eliminate coverage for millions of people.
""This would take us back,"" she said.
The United States is the only wealthy country where a substantial number of citizens lack health insurance, due to nearly a century of pushback against universal coverage from doctors, insurance companies, and elected officials.
""The complexity is everywhere throughout the system,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, who worked in the George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations. ""The big bug is that people fall between the cracks.""
This year,
KFF Health News
is speaking to Americans about the challenges they face in finding health insurance and the effects on their ability to get care; to providers who serve the uninsured; and to policy experts about why, even when the nation hit its lowest recorded uninsured rate in 2023, nearly a tenth of the U.S. population still lacked health coverage.
Sponsor Message
So far, the reporting has found that despite decades of policies designed to increase access to care, the very structure of the nation's health insurance system creates the opposite effect.
Government-backed universal coverage
has eluded U.S. policymakers
for decades.
After lobbying from physician groups, President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned plans to include universal health coverage in the Social Security Act of 1935. Then, because of a wage and salary cap used to control inflation during World War II, more employers offered health insurance to lure workers. In 1954, health coverage was
formally exempted
from income tax requirements, which led more employers to offer the benefit as part of compensation packages.
Losing health coverage can lead to people getting less care. Kiana George lost Medicaid coverage in 2023 after she got a job at an after-school program that pays about $800 a month. The Camden, Ala., resident stopped her high blood pressure treatment and later landed in an intensive care unit.

Insurance coverage offered by employers came to form the foundation of the U.S. health system. But eventually, problems with linking health insurance to employment emerged.
""We realized, well, wait, not everybody is working,"" said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at the Columbia School of Social Work who studies the impact of social policies on access to care. ""Children aren't working. People who are elderly are not working. People with disabilities are not working.""
Yet subsequent efforts to expand coverage to all Americans were met with backlash from unions who wanted health insurance as a bargaining chip, providers who didn't want government oversight, and those who had coverage through their employers.
That led policymakers to add programs piecemeal to make health insurance accessible to more Americans.
There's Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for people with low incomes and disabilities, both created in 1965; the Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997; the ACA's exchange plans and Medicaid expansion for people who can't access job-based coverage, created in 2010.
As a result, the U.S. has a patchwork of health insurance programs with numerous interest groups vying for dollars, rather than a cohesive system, health policy researchers say.
Sponsor Message
Falling through the cracks
The lack of a cohesive system means even though Americans are eligible for health insurance, they struggle to access it, said Mark Shepard, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. No central entity exists in the U.S. to ensure that all people have a plan, he said.
Over half of the uninsured might qualify for Medicaid or subsidies that can
help cover the costs
of an ACA plan,
according to KFF
. But many people aren't aware of their options or can't navigate overlapping programs — and even subsidized coverage can be unaffordable.
Those who have fallen through the cracks said it feels like the system has failed them.
Yorjeny Almonte of Allentown, Pennsylvania, earns about $2,600 a month as an inspector in a cabinet warehouse. When she started her job in December 2023, she didn't want to spend nearly 10% of her income on health insurance.
But, last year, her uninsured mom chose to fly to the Dominican Republic to get care for a health concern. So Almonte, 23, who also needed to see a doctor, investigated her employer's health offerings. By then she had missed the deadline to sign up.
""Now I have to wait another year,"" she said.

New studies show what's at stake if Medicaid is scaled back
In January, Camden, Alabama, resident Kiana George, who's uninsured, landed in an intensive care unit months after she stopped seeing a nurse practitioner and taking blood pressure medications — an ordeal that saddled her with nearly $7,000 in medical bills.
George, 30, was kicked off Medicaid in 2023 after she got hired by an after-school program. It pays $800 a month, an income too high to qualify her for Medicaid in Alabama, which hasn't expanded to cover most low-income adults. She also doesn't make enough for a free or reduced-cost ACA plan.
George, who has a 9-year-old daughter, said she ""has no idea"" how she can repay the debt from the emergency room visit. And because she fears more bills, she has given up on treatment for ovarian cysts.

""It hurts, but I'm just gonna take my chances,"" she said.
Debating the high cost of care
Researchers have known for decades that a lack of insurance coverage leads to poor access to health care, said Tom Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.
""It's only more recently we've had really good, strong evidence that shows that health insurance really does improve health outcomes,"" Buchmueller said.
Research released this spring
by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that expanding Medicaid reduced low-income adults' chances of dying by 2.5%. In 2019,
a separate study
published by that nonpartisan think tank provided experimental evidence that health insurance coverage reduced mortality among middle-aged adults.
In late May, the House narrowly advanced the budget legislation that independent government analysts said would result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage and reduce federal spending on programs like Medicaid by billions of dollars.
A key provision would require some Medicaid enrollees to work, volunteer, or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month, starting at the end of 2026. Most Medicaid enrollees already work or have some reason they can't, such as a disability, according to KFF.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended the requirement as ""moral.""
""If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system,"" he
told CBS News
in the wake of the bill's passage.
A Senate version of the bill also includes work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients.
Fiscal conservatives argue a solution is needed to curb health care's rising costs.
The U.S. spends about
twice as much per capita
on health care than other wealthy nations, and that spending would grow under the GOP's budget bill, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank that supports less government spending on health care.
Sponsor Message
But the bill doesn't address the root causes of administrative complexity or unaffordable care, Cannon said. To do that would entail, for instance, doing away with the tax break for employer-sponsored care, which he said fuels excessive spending, high prices, and ties health insurance to employment. He said the bill should cut federal funding for Medicaid, not just limit its growth, to reduce excessive health care prices and spending.
The bill would throw more people into a high-cost health care landscape with little protection, said Aaron Carroll, president and CEO of AcademyHealth, a nonpartisan health policy research nonprofit.
""There's a ton of evidence that shows that if you make people pay more for health care, they get less health care,"" he said. ""There's lots of evidence that shows that disproportionately affects poor, sicker people.""
Labon McKenzie, 45, lives in Georgia, the only state that requires some Medicaid enrollees to work or complete other qualifying activities to obtain coverage.
He hasn't been able to work since he broke multiple bones after he fell through a skylight while on the job three years ago. He got fired from a county road and bridge crew after the accident and hasn't been approved for Social Security or disability benefits.
""I can't stand up too long,"" he said. ""I can't sit down too long.""
In February, McKenzie started seeing double, but canceled an appointment with an ophthalmologist because he couldn't come up with the $300 the doctor wanted in advance. His cousin gave him an eye patch to tide him over, and, in desperation, he took expired eye drops his daughter gave him. ""I had to try something,"" he said.
McKenzie, who lives in rural Fort Gaines, wants to work again. But without benefits, he can't get the care he needs to become well enough.
""I just want my body fixed,"" he said.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has spent years spreading doubt about the safety of vaccines and linking them to autism.
Dozens of studies have debunked the theory, but it has nevertheless persisted for years. Part of the reason why may be that autism diagnoses have soared over the last few decades.
Dr. Allen Frances is psychiatrist who led the task force that created the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which expanded the definition of Autism, which he says might have played a factor in that uptick.
Rates of autism have exploded in recent decades.  Could the clinical definition of autism itself be partly to blame?

An influential committee that shapes U.S. vaccine policy – a flashpoint under the leadership of Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – has recommended that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines containing trace amounts of a
preservative
that's rarely used anymore.
The discussion of thimerosal, a form of mercury that's sometimes added to vaccines for sterilization, dominated much of Thursday's public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The committee guides the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine schedule for children and adults.
The two-day meeting at CDC headquarters in Atlanta was unusually high-profile, given Kennedy's recent decision to boot the entire committee of experts a few weeks ago and replace them with
his own hand-picked roster
, which included some members
with a history
of making inaccurate claims about the safety of vaccines.
Sponsor Message
Public Health
RFK Jr. replaced everyone on the CDC's vaccine panel. Here's why that matters
While ACIP typically includes 17 voting members, Kennedy's overhauled panel only included seven of them, following a last-minute decision by one of them to step down.
On Thursday, a majority of the panel voted to reaffirm the existing CDC recommendations that anyone over six months receive the annual flu shot. They also voted 5-2 in favor of a monoclonal antibody shot made by Merck that offers protection against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, for infants younger than 8 months.
But in three separate votes the committee voted to recommend children, pregnant women and all adults receive single-dose flu immunizations with vaccines that don't have thimerosal.
Theories that the chemical could cause autism in children have
long been disproven
. Even so, manufacturers voluntarily removed it from childhood vaccines. While it's used
in some multi-dose vials
in several products, there are no vaccines on the pediatric vaccine schedule that contain thimerosal.
The ACIP votes could effectively ban use of the preservative, despite a preponderance of evidence that it is safe.
Dr. Cody Meissner
, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth College, was the only ACIP member who voted against those recommendations.
Health
RFK Jr. sent Congress 'medical disinformation' to defend COVID vaccine schedule change
""Of all the issues that ACIP needs to focus on, this is not a big issue,"" he said. ""The risk from influenza is so much greater than the non-existent, as far as we know, risk from thimerosal.""
He added: ""There is no scientific evidence that thimerosal has caused a problem.""
Meissner's comments came in response to a lengthy presentation on the preservative from Lyn Redwood, a nurse and former president of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine advocacy group that Kennedy founded and led for many years.

""Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable population is a good place to start with making America healthy again,"" she told the committee.
Much of what Redwood said about thimerosal was undercut by
a CDC document
that had been originally posted with the meeting materials — and then without explanation removed ahead of the meeting. It detailed peer-reviewed literature showing ""no association between prenatal exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccinations and autism spectrum disorder in children.""
In response to a question about why the document had been taken down, Dr. Robert Malone, an ACIP member, said his understanding was that it had not been ""authorized by the Office of the Secretary.""
Members of the committee questioned the analyses provided by CDC, and wondered whether they were ignoring data on adverse events that showed up in relation to the studies they presented, even after the staff explained they had parsed the data thoroughly.
Prominent medical groups welcomed the recommendations on flu and RSV, but expressed concern about the overall tone of the meeting.
Dr. Sean O'Leary, who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the ACIP discussion on influenza and RSV ""confirmed that this is an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in immunizations and the vaccine approval process.""
While the person serving as CDC director would typically sign off on ACIP recommendations, there is no one in the role currently, so the responsibility for signing off on these recommendations go to Health Secretary Kennedy."

Senate Republicans hit a major setback in their race to pass a massive tax and spending package on Thursday, as a chamber official ruled against a key Medicaid provision, putting in doubt plans for a vote by the end of the week.
The nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian, who plays a key role in determining what provisions can stay in the fast-tracked bill, said the GOP change to how states can tax Medicaid providers does not adhere to rules for passing the bill with a simple majority. This was a key provision to help offset the costs of the bill's tax cuts.

Senate Republicans a day earlier had proposed a $15 billion rural health stabilization fund to address the slashing of a provider tax that is a critical source of funding for many states.
Democrats, who are making arguments before the parliamentarian to slash key sections of the bill, called the ruling a win.
""With more decisions to come, this guidance results in more than $250 billion in health care cuts removed from the Republicans' big bad bill,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. ""Democrats fought and won, striking health care cuts from this bill that would hurt Americans' walking on an economic tightrope.
""This bill is rotten to its core, and I'll keep fighting the cuts in this morally bankrupt bill until the end,"" Wyden added.
Multiple Republican officials familiar with the discussions told NPR that Republicans will continue to rework some provisions to address the parliamentarian's guidance. Republicans are also downplaying the significance of the setback and the framing by Democrats.
Medicaid provisions have been among the most complicated provisions to negotiate in the bill. One issue is a directive Senate Republicans added that states cut and freeze the tax they impose on Medicaid providers from the 6% in the House bill down to 3%, effectively halving the amount that states will receive in tax revenue from those providers. Critics say the change will result in major challenges for rural hospitals that rely on that money because it becomes part of a big pot of tax revenue for states that plays into the complex formula that determines how much federal funding is received as part of the joint program run with states.
Sponsor Message
Other provisions were flagged by the parliamentarian, including one barring Medicaid from covering gender affirming care and denying coverage to some Medicaid recipients who are not U.S. citizens.
Senate Republicans had hoped to begin voting on the legislation this week, but it's unclear if they'll meet their deadline to send it to President Trump's desk by the July 4th deadline. They are also facing intense pressure from Trump to pass the bill this week, and several members of the conference are due for a White House meeting today.
Despite the new guidance from the parliamentarian, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump's July 4th goal remains in place.
""The President is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day,"" she said during a briefing at the White House Thursday afternoon.
When asked whether Trump thinks the parliamentarian should be removed, Leavitt said she had not spoken with the president about that and would ""let him speak on it.""
""He knows this is part of the process and the inner workings of the Senate,"" she added. ""He remains very much engaged in these conversations and in this process with lawmakers in both the Senate and the House side, and the whole White House does as well.""
The stakes are high for both Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, given that the legislation carries the bulk of the president's domestic agenda. The GOP leaders have has struggled to resolve major sticking points. While Senate committee leaders have made several significant changes to the bill in recent days, the issue of funding for rural hospitals emerged as a major roadblock.
The new Medicaid language was added to the House-passed bill in the Senate, drawing objections from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee put out the compromise stabilization fund that would direct $15 billion over a 5-year period to states in need. However, that fell short of what other senators say was needed.
Sponsor Message
Collins has said the fund needed to be closer to $100 billion, and warned colleagues from racing to a vote this week without carefully resolving the issue. Hawley has argued the Senate changes would force drawn-out negotiations with the House, delaying final passage of the legislation. Tillis, who is running for reelection in 2026, served in the state house in his home state before coming to Congress and warned states wouldn't be able to make up the gap in funding due to the new cuts in the bill.
After the GOP conference discussed the setback from the parliamentarian during a luncheon on Thursday, Hawley said leaders are reconsidering their options.
""I think that Senate leadership is trying to decide what direction exactly they want to go in,"" he told reporters.
But when asked for more details, Hawley wasn't sure.
""I don't think they know, it sounded to me like it was very fluid,"" he said.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., told NPR that he believes there is a path to keeping a provider tax in the spending bill.
""[The parliamentarian] had a technical issue with it. And we've got a technical response,"" he said, although he did not specify what was modified. ""We think it'll be addressed. It could change timelines a little bit. So you may see some change to it, but generally we think it was a technical issue with a technical fix.""
Hoeven also said that he believes the floated stabilization fund for rural hospitals will be upwards of $15 billion.
Senate GOP leaders are also waiting for a determination of whether major tax provisions in the bill meet the strict rules for what can be included. The parliamentarian is still reviewing those elements to make sure each has a direct impact on the budget, among other regulations. Several other provisions in the House version, such as one barring nationwide judicial injunctions, have already been cut in that review.
Sponsor Message
There is also lingering debate over the fate of energy tax credits in the bill, changes to the safety net program for low-income families known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or snap and a provision on public lands.
Senate Republicans are also navigating differences with House GOP lawmakers who represent districts in New York and California who insist they need to preserve a state and local tax break, known as SALT. That section of the bill was negotiated with House Speaker Mike Johnson for their constituents who pay high state and local taxes.
Senate Majority Leader Thune can only afford to lose three GOP votes in order to pass the bill.
Fiscal hawks in the Senate, such as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have raised concerns about new deficit spending and could both potentially vote against the plan as a result.
However, even if Thune is able to resolve all of the issues in his chamber, several different factions of House Republicans are warning they will oppose the latest bill that's emerging from the Senate. Thune has repeatedly called Trump the ""closer"" for the massive legislation, and he's betting political pressure from the White House will force Republicans to back the package.

The Supreme Court delivered a back-door blow to Planned Parenthood on Thursday, ruling that states may cut off Medicaid reimbursements for the organization's non-abortion medical services.
At issue was a provision of the federal Medicaid law that guarantees Medicaid patients the ability to choose their doctors, or in the words of the statute, they are entitled to ""any qualified and willing provider.""
South Carolina, however, maintained that it could disqualify Medicaid providers for ""any reason that state law allows."" Or as Republican governor Henry McMaster put it, ""Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize abortion providers who are in direct opposition to their beliefs.""
Sponsor Message
On Thursday, the Supreme Court sided with the state by a 6-to-3 vote, along ideological lines.
Writing for the court's conservative super-majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that particularly in cases that put conditions on how federal money is spent, Congress must ""clearly and unambiguously"" authorize the right to sue as an enforcement mechanism, and Congress, he said, did not do that here. Indeed, he noted, the statute nowhere uses the term, ""right to sue.""
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing for the dissenting liberal justices, countered that the words in the statute ""could not have been clearer.""
The court's decision, she said, ""will strip"" Medicaid recipients all over the country of ""a deeply personal freedom, the ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.""
A dark time for Planned Parenthood
Planned Parenthood's president and CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, in an interview with NPR, said the decision would have widespread ramifications and would allow seventeen states to strip Planned Parenthood clinics of the ability to provide non-abortion medical services to rural and low income people.
""It's a dark time [when] a health center has to close, any time a patient is not able to get the care that they need"" said Johnson, ""That is a dark time because we can provide that care for our nation's most vulnerable.""
Sponsor Message
These are undeniably tough days for Planned Parenthood, which also faces the possibility—or likelihood—that the Republican congress will soon cut off all its Medicaid funding in every state in the country. What's more, Planned Parenthood is facing financial difficulties nationwide — NPR
reports
that Planned Parenthood has closed at least 34 clinics since last year.
Support for the states' rights
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, however, sees Thursday's decision as a necessary correction to allow states to determine how they allocate federal funds.
""This is a really big deal for states that have been sucked into a lot of federal litigation,"" he said. ""And if states decide to adopt pro-life policies, then they should be free to determine that Medicaid dollars are spent consistent with that.""
Federal funds have long been banned for abortion, observes University of California, Davis Professor Mary Ziegler, author of seven books on the history of abortion and abortion policy. But, she notes that Planned Parenthood clinics serve as primary care providers in many underserved areas, including in South Carolina, where Thursday's case began.
In that sense, she says, Thursday's court ruling isn't about abortion, but it is likely to put a financial strain on many Planned Parenthood clinics, forcing some to close their doors. And if congress defunds Planned Parenthood entirely—as it may well do in the coming weeks-- she says, there would be ripple effects even in states where abortion is legal.
""Even in places like Southern California where Planned Parenthood does a pretty good job of fundraising,"" some affiliates there get 30 percent of their funding from Medicaid, ""so that would be a huge hit,"" she says.
'Supreme irony'
Ziegler sees "" a supreme irony"" in the attacks on Planned Parenthood in the aftermath of the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion.
Sponsor Message
""For years, the pro-choice movement thought it would need to defend its victories in court and the pro-life movement had this fantasy that if the courts were removed from the picture and Roe was gone, they would go from victory to victory,"" said Ziegler, ""And instead we've seen the long term trend since the end of
Roe
is that pro-choice groups are winning victory after victory with voters and it's the pro-life groups that have seen they really need the courts to win.""
How did we get here?
Since 1976, federal law has prohibited using federal Medicaid funding for abortion services with limited exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening complications. But the Medicaid program reimburses ""any qualified medical provider"" for non-abortion services, and in South Carolina, a state with a shortage of primary care providers, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic has long provided routine medical services for low-income residents — including physical exams and cancer screenings.
When the governor removed the clinics from the state's Medicaid roster, the clinics sued, arguing that Medicaid patients should be able to choose their own health care providers for services that don't involve abortion.
They won, not once but repeatedly, the lower courts ruled that Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is qualified and willing to provide Medicaid services. Writing for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge J. Harvey Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee, concluded that Congress had clearly conferred ""an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their health care provider.""
But on Thursday, the Supreme Court reversed that decision."

6 feel-good exercises to alleviate sore, achy feet
Tense pelvic floor muscles can cause constipation.
Correct.
Let's talk about some of the symptoms that can indicate pelvic floor dysfunction. What are common signs you might have pelvic floor tension or tightness?
Your muscles have to relax fully to empty your bowels. If they're not relaxing because they're overly tight or tense, you can have straining with bowel movements, hemorrhoids, fissures, incomplete emptying and even feeling like your stools are really thin.
Tightness can also lead to having a hard time starting your urine stream. You may feel like your bladder isn't emptying completely.
Another common symptom is painful intercourse. It can feel like something can't enter the vagina. You may also feel that with inserting tampons or during pelvic examinations.
What can you do to prevent or address pelvic floor tension?
Watch your posture. A lot of us sit too much throughout the day. Vary your movements. If you are sitting, keep your feet flat or cross at the ankles. Also, unclench your butt.
Take some big, deep breaths throughout the day to soften your pelvic floor muscles; then work on stretching with a deep squat or yoga poses like child's pose or happy baby pose.
There are also devices you can use at home for internal massage to the muscles, such as a
therapy wand
or
vaginal dilators
to help relax the muscles internally.
The other sign of pelvic floor dysfunction is weakness. What does that look like in the body?
Some of the things we commonly see are urinary leakage when coughing, sneezing, running and jumping.
Sponsor Message
Another is pelvic organ prolapse, where the pelvic organs aren't as supported by that hammock of muscles as we'd like them to be, so they start to drop or push into the vaginal canal.
If you feel less sensation with intercourse or urinate during intercourse or orgasms, those can be other signs of weak pelvic floor muscles.
How can we strengthen our pelvic floor muscles?
Work on pelvic floor strengthening exercises. Do quick Kegel contractions and longer-hold five- or 10-second Kegel contractions in different positions and during exercises like lunges and squats.
Tighten those muscles before activities that cause leakage. I always say, ""Kegel before you cough,"" or ""Squeeze before you sneeze.""
The biggest thing is to stop straining [when you go to the bathroom], because that can weaken your pelvic floor over time. For bowel movements, I recommend using a stool under your feet to put you in the squatting position [and make it easier to go].

If you are having these symptoms, what should you do?
In every state in the United States, you can access a pelvic floor therapist for an evaluation without a referral from a physician.
Your insurance may require [a referral], but you can at least have an evaluation, and they can tell you whether you have a pelvic floor muscle issue and connect you with a medical provider who can see you and/or write a prescription to continue treatment.
If you have common signs of infection of the urinary tract or the vagina, your first stop should be checking with a medical provider and getting things [like a urinary tract infection or a yeast infection] ruled out.
What should you look for in a pelvic floor physical therapist?
They should be trained and qualified to do a pelvic floor muscle internal assessment to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles. They should not just hook you up to devices like Kegel or electric stimulation machines.

The treatment should be a combination of exercise, manual therapy and education. They should also give you things at home to work on so you can do some self-treatment.

Child labor sounds as if it belongs to a long-ago era, but for 138 million children it is a daily routine.
""These are children who work under the hot sun in farms, tending crops when they should be in school,"" says Claudia Cappa, a senior analyst with UNICEF. ""They are scrubbing floors behind closed doors where they are extremely vulnerable to violence and exploitation, these children will carry very heavy loads in mines, breathing in fumes that damage their health.""
She's one of the authors of a new
report on child labor
from UNICEF and the International Labor Organization.
Sponsor Message
Despite the grim topic,
the report offers encouraging news
: Steady progress has been made in reducing child labor globally. In the past five years, the number of working children has dropped by 20 million.
But the goal to eliminate it is far from being met.
""We have nearly halved the number of children involved in child labor globally since 2000 from 246 million to 138 million children,"" says
Theresa Betancourt
, director of the program on children and adversity at Boston College. ""But that's still unacceptable, so we have a long way to go.""
Of the 138 million children, 54 million toil in environments that are harmful to their physical and mental health, according to the report.
That number includes children forced into armed groups or subject to sexual exploitation — the most extreme forms of child labor. Researchers say it's difficult to obtain reliable data on those issues.
Asia's successful strategies
The reason behind these startling numbers is straightforward. ""We have plenty of evidence that indicates that poverty is a key driver of child labor,"" says Cappa. Most children enter the workforce around the age of 5, often helping a family business, she says.
""So reducing poverty is a critical strategy for eliminating child labor. We also know that children need to go to school. Schooling has to be free. So we know what works.""
Sponsor Message
Asia has embraced that philosophy with positive results. The percentage of children who work has dropped from 13% in 2008 to just 3% in 2024 — from 114 million to 28 million.
Governments get credit for this improvement, says Betancourt. They've taken steps to aid poor families — giving them cash, for example — and they've taken measures to ensure that kids go to school.
""We have seen investments in Asia in quality education, universal access to education, compulsory education, which means children are spending their time learning and in school settings,"" Betancourt says. And there's an added benefit: Kids in school often get free meals.
Why rates are high in sub-Saharan Africa
In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest global rate of child labor — about 1 in 4 kids work. And the report points out there has only been a slight improvement, with the rate dropping from 25% in 2008 to 22% in 2024.
There are several reasons why child labor is harder to address in these countries.
Most of child labor overall is in agriculture, according to the report. And in sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture is the main livelihood, families often enlist their children in their farm work, according to Cappa.
And even if parents want to send their kids to school, there may not be a school they can enroll them in, says Betancourt. With a rapidly growing youth population in Africa, the number of schools has not kept pace. Betancourt says there's been an underinvestment in building new schools in sub-Saharan Africa in particular.
Ongoing and emerging conflicts are another reason for the higher rates of child labor in sub-Saharan Africa. This violence destabilizes economies, adding more pressure for struggling families to put their children to work.
An uncertain future
Future progress is in jeopardy in this era of aid cuts. Some of the world's wealthiest countries fund programs in low- and middle-income countries that aim to address poverty and access to education. But in the past year, countries like the U.S. and the U.K. have cut billions of dollars in funding for such programs. Experts are concerned that could slow down the advancements made in eliminating child labor as well, since the issues are so interconnected.
Sponsor Message
For UNICEF's Claudia Cappa, the matter of child labor is a personal one. Her own mother worked cleaning houses and farming in the south of Italy when she was 9 years old, because her parents thought she would be more useful to the family if she worked rather than went to school.
Cappa's mother is now 75 years old, and Cappa often thinks of the opportunities she herself had that her mother did not, just one generation away.
""I didn't have the same level of pressure,"" she says. ""I was able to go to school, I was able to graduate, to apply for a position in UNICEF, to come to the United States and to speak to you today."""

Republicans are facing a conundrum.
They want to cut taxes with their ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" But the tax cuts they want will explode the federal debt. So they've been looking for spending cuts. One big area where they want to slash: Medicaid, which provides
over 75 million Americans
— including low-income families, seniors and disabled people — with health insurance.
The conundrum: Medicaid is
widely popular
, including among many Republican voters in their now more working-class coalition forged by President Trump.
So how can they cut Medicaid while sheltering themselves from the political fallout of cutting Medicaid?
Sponsor Message
Their answer: work requirements. Draft versions of the bill have
included provisions
that would force millions of working-age, able-bodied adults to work to receive Medicaid — and every six months show the government proof they work to remain on the program.
It's sort of a brilliant answer politically because, on the face of it, the idea that able-bodied adults should have to work to receive government benefits is
widely popular
. Sure, progressives argue that health care should be a right available to all. But conservatives argue
these
requirements are necessary to fight ""waste, fraud, and abuse."" And, more broadly, that work requirements incentivize people to work and prevent able-bodied, working-age people from freeloading off of hard-working Americans. Some argue that work requirements may even help this nonworking population, pushing them to find gainful employment and achieve greater prosperity for themselves or their families. There is some
peer-reviewed economic evidence
that suggests kicking people off of government health insurance programs can encourage them to work more.
"" I certainly think it's reasonable to impose work requirements for Medicaid,"" says Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Corinth says he supports Medicaid and also the many work-requirement exemptions found in the One Big Beautiful Bill, including for disabled people, children and the elderly. As for those who can work, he suggests, they should work, and he thinks ""there is a pretty good chance you'll see real employment gains"" if work requirements get implemented. This nudge to work, he says, could ultimately prove to be beneficial for many in this population.
Sponsor Message
However, a
growing amount
of
evidence
suggests that adding work and other eligibility requirements to social programs fails to do much to actually encourage work. The majority of people who use these programs
already work
. Or, if they don't work, it's often because they're disabled or elderly or children or have issues that adding work requirements to a government program won't usually help with.
One of the biggest sources of cost savings from work requirements may not come from eliminating benefits for those who aren't working. Instead, studies suggest that, in practice, work and other eligibility requirements achieve a lot of savings in a sort of sneaky way. It's that the eligibility requirements themselves create a bureaucratic rigmarole that many
who are eligible
for benefits struggle to navigate. A
ton of them
get lost in the maze of paperwork and get kicked off the program. Call it the paperwork trap (h/t to
Planet Money
's Erika Beras for helping coin this term).
In economics, this sort of red tape that makes it harder for people to do or get something is known as ""administrative burdens"" or ""ordeals"" (although the behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
offer
a more fun name for it: ""sludge"").
A back door for cutting the social safety net?
Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy, is a leading scholar of administrative burdens.
"" Bureaucracies can often generate administrative burdens inadvertently,"" Moynihan says. ""But they can also be deliberately created by policymakers who want to reduce the cost of programs by making it more difficult for people to access them.""
The federal government has a wide variety of social programs that vary in difficulty to prove eligibility and obtain benefits. Moynihan points to Social Security as a program that's more easily accessible, so a much higher percentage of people eligible for it actually use it. Almost all American seniors are eligible for Social Security and the government makes it almost automatic to receive benefits, which is why
nearly 100%
of those eligible get it. On the other end of the spectrum are programs like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), an old-school welfare program that was reformed under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Programs like these have stricter eligibility requirements, and they're more difficult to sign up for because people have to prove their eligibility (like, for example, proving how much they make). That results in these programs having a much lower participation rate.
Sponsor Message
There's a growing mountain of evidence on the effects of administrative burdens. (For a good summary of this literature, check out
this recent essay
in the
Journal of Economic Perspectives
from Moynihan and his co-author Pamela Herd).
As an example, Moynihan points to what happened in Arkansas after it became the first state to adopt work requirements for Medicaid in 2018. A
2019 study
published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
found that these work requirements failed to boost employment rates much or at all within the first year after they were implemented. Meanwhile, the authors found that thousands of Arkansans who did work or who qualified for exemptions — because, for example, they were disabled or elderly — were kicked off the program.
Moynihan says it's
a similar story
with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), more commonly known as food stamps. He says SNAP already has work requirements (which Republicans want to beef up in the One Big Beautiful Bill), and
evidence shows
that
existing requirements
haven't done much to encourage work. They mostly just make it harder for people to get food assistance. In fact, evidence suggests that SNAP work requirements have the biggest effect on those least able to work,
according to Yale scholars Chima Ndumele and Jacob Wallace
.
""The largest effect of work requirements isn't actually to incentivize people to work,"" Moynihan says. ""The largest effect is to get people who are working and put them in a situation where they're caught in this administrative trap that they simply can't get around. And so they tend to lose benefits even though they are actually fulfilling the requirements. It's the paperwork that catches them.""
If we humans were the perfectly rational creatures of old-school economic theory, these types of administrative burdens wouldn't do much to trip us up. Back in the early 1980s, economists
theorized
these ""ordeals,"" as they called them, could even be beneficial, serving as an efficient way to target benefits to those who want or need them the most.
Sponsor Message
However, a lot of newer research, especially in behavioral economics, points to how our cognitive quirks and limitations may prevent us from doing what's in our best interests. For example, we may procrastinate and fail to fill out the necessary paperwork in time. We may suffer from ""present bias,"" valuing our time now more than our well-being later. We may not even know we have to fill out forms to get benefits or even about these benefits at all.
Studies
suggest
that
low-income
populations have
a harder time
dealing with these administrative burdens. They are often living paycheck to paycheck. Sometimes they're homeless. Sometimes they have disabilities or
chronic diseases
. They may have inflexible work schedules or not have a computer. They may have life stresses and struggles that
lower their mental bandwidth
, and it's hard for them to dedicate the time and effort to satisfy requirements even though they meet the criteria for assistance.
Kevin Corinth acknowledges that red tape can cause problems and force some legitimate beneficiaries to fall through the cracks. But, he says, the reality is ""work requirements are popular, especially among Republicans, but even among many Democrats."" And enforcing those requirements necessarily entails some red tape, as much as he hates it.
Draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill have left some discretion to the states when it comes to setting work requirements and how Medicaid recipients have to prove their compliance with them. Corinth argues that states should invest time and effort into ""making it as easy as possible to demonstrate compliance, so people can focus on complying as opposed to the actual paperwork part of it."" He suggests administrative burdens can be minimized and not be extremely onerous.
Moynihan, however, suggests that administrative burdens might be the point. He suggests that politicians have learned to use administrative burdens as a sneaky way to cut popular social programs. It gives them more political cover. They can claim that they're not really cutting these programs. They're just making sure the right, deserving people get them. But, in effect, they swamp potential beneficiaries with paperwork and other hassles and make it more difficult to get benefits. Some significant percentage gets caught in the spider web of paperwork and, boom, the government reduces how much it spends under the program.

That's basically what Moynihan sees in the draft versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill. He says it could prove to be the largest cut to Medicaid we've ever seen — even though many Republicans are claiming that they're not really cutting it, just ""reforming"" it (although there have been
some Freudian slips
when making that claim). The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan budget agency, estimates that the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill would cut Medicaid spending by
almost $800 billion
over 10 years. And, Moynihan argues, they're ""doing it through the backdoor mechanism of simply making it harder for people to maintain coverage through these administrative requirements."""

The long-term health care industry is facing a double whammy from President Trump's crackdown on immigrants and the Republican Party's proposals to reduce Medicaid spending. The industry is highly dependent on foreign workers: More than 800,000 immigrants and naturalized citizens comprise
28% of direct care employees
at home care agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other long-term care companies.

But in January, the
Trump administration rescinded
former President Joe Biden's 2021 policy that
protected health care facilities
from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The administration's broad immigration crackdown threatens to drastically reduce the number of current and future workers for the industry. ""People may be here on a green card, and they are afraid ICE is going to show up,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofits that care for older adults.
A collision of policies
Staffing shortages and quality-of-care problems would be compounded by other policies pushed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, according to nursing home officials, resident advocates and academic experts. Federal spending cuts under negotiation may strip nursing homes of some of their largest revenue sources by limiting ways
states leverage Medicaid
money and by making it harder for new nursing home residents to retroactively
qualify for Medicaid
. Care for 6 in 10 residents is
paid for by Medicaid
, the state-federal health program for poor or disabled Americans.
""We are facing the collision of two policies here that could further erode staffing in nursing homes and present health outcome challenges,"" said
Eric Roberts
, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The industry hasn't recovered from COVID-19, which
killed more than 200,000
long-term care facility residents and workers and led to massive staff attrition and turnover. Nursing homes have struggled to replace licensed nurses, who can find better-paying jobs at hospitals and doctors' offices, as well as nursing assistants, who can earn more working at big-box stores or fast-food joints. Quality issues that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic have expanded: The percentage of nursing homes that federal health inspectors cited for putting residents in jeopardy of immediate harm or death
has risen
alarmingly from 17% in 2015 to 28% in 2024.
In addition to seeking to reduce Medicaid spending, congressional Republicans have proposed shelving the biggest nursing home reform in decades: a Biden-era rule mandating minimum staffing levels that
would require most
of the United States' nearly 15,000 nursing homes to hire more workers.
The long-term care industry expects demand for direct care workers to burgeon with an influx of aging baby boomers needing professional care. The Census Bureau has projected that the number of people 65 or older will grow from 63 million this year to 82 million in 2050.
In an email, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency ""is committed to supporting a strong, stable long-term care workforce"" and ""continues to work with states and providers to ensure quality care for older adults and individuals with disabilities."" In a separate email, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said foreigners wanting to work as caregivers ""need to do that by coming here the legal way"" but did not address the effect on the long-term care workforce of deportations of classes of authorized immigrants.
A commitment to the job
Goodwin Living, a faith-based nonprofit, runs three retirement communities in Northern Virginia for people who live independently, need a little assistance each day, have memory issues or require the availability of around-the-clock nurses. It also operates a retirement community in Washington, D.C. Medicare rates Goodwin House Alexandria as one of the
best-staffed nursing homes
in the country. Forty percent of the organization's 1,450 employees are foreign-born and are either seeking citizenship or are already naturalized, according to Lindsay Hutter, a Goodwin spokesperson.

Conteh was working as a nurse in a hospital in Sierra Leone in 2009 when she learned of a lottery for visas to come to the United States. She won, though she couldn't afford to bring her husband and two children along at the time. After she got a nursing assistant certification, Goodwin hired her in 2012.
Conteh said taking care of elders is embedded in the culture of African families. When she was 9, she helped feed and dress her grandmother, a job that rotated among her and her sisters. She washed her father when he was dying of prostate cancer. Her husband joined her in the United States in 2017; she cares for him because he has heart failure.

The international vaccine agency,
Gavi
, has strongly rejected Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s accusations that it was not following scientific data on vaccines, after he said the U.S. would halt all contributions unless the body made changes to its practices.
Kennedy's remarks were made at a Gavi pledging summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where countries and philanthropies promise to deliver funds. A video of Kennedy's remarks, first reported by
Politico
and later
posted by
The New York Times
, shows him praising Gavi for its mission of making medicine affordable to everyone but then pivoting to criticisms. He says the group ""ignores the science"" when it comes to vaccine safety and calls on Gavi to ""re-earn the public trust"" before the U.S. would reconsider its decision to end U.S. contributions.
Sponsor Message
Supporters of global vaccines for children are on high alert after published remarks made by Kennedy, who said the U.S. would halt its contributions to Gavi, the international vaccine alliance.
Gavi's record
The international agency, established in 2000, says it has played a role in vaccinating 1.1 billion children against a long list of potentially debilitating diseases — from polio to malaria to mpox to measles — and claims credit for saving 20 million lives. Global health experts say Gavi is instrumental in getting vaccinations to lower-resource countries, providing cash to buy vaccines and support for disease outbreak response.
The U.S. has been one of the largest donors to Gavi, funding about 13% of the agency's budget. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. pledged $2.53 billion starting in September 2022 through the year 2030. Of that amount $880 million has so far been dispersed.
In a statement, Gavi said that the organization's ""utmost concern is the safety and health of children"" and that it rejected Kennedy's accusations that it was not following scientific data on vaccines.
""Any decision made by Gavi with regards to its vaccine portfolio is made in alignment with recommendations by WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), a group of independent experts that reviews all available data through a rigorous, transparent, and independent process. This ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,"" the statement said.

Possible impacts of defunding
Kennedy's position would not be the first time that President Trump's team has sought to reduce U.S. support for the agency. The administration cut more than a billion dollars in funding to Gavi as part of its foreign assistance shakeup earlier this year.
But Kennedy's words nonetheless spark
concern that the motive for such cuts isn't just reducing the U.S. deficit, says
Dr. William Moss
, a pediatrician and professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. He is the executive director of the school's International Vaccine Access Center.
""I think [Kennedy] is bringing his long-standing views based on conspiracy theories and misinformation and disinformation around vaccines,"" Moss said.
""There's no doubt that we want to ensure that the vaccines that we use are as safe and effective as possible. We all agree with that,"" Moss said. ""But to put up barriers and to withdraw funding based on misguided concerns about vaccine safety is very tragic, and I don't think Kennedy is speaking for most Americans with this type of decision.""
Without U.S. funding, Gavi will survive, Moss says. It has other donors like the United Kingdom and the Gates Foundation, but it will have to scale back its operations. In fact, this week for the replenishment conference where Kennedy reportedly spoke, the Gates Foundation announced a new $1.6 billion pledge and encouraged others to up their donations, ""warning that without renewed support, children could be left vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.""
(
The Gates Foundation is a funder of NPR and this blog.
)
Moss predicts that the loss of all U.S. funding will likely mean ""fewer vaccine introductions into many low- and middle-income countries. We'll see a scale back of some of the large measles and rubella vaccination campaigns that Gavi supports, and some of the disease outbreak response that Gavi supports.""
Sponsor Message
The impact of the administration's decision to stop funding Gavi will be felt by Americans, he adds. Although the organization does not work in the United States, a reduced ability to provide measles vaccines in other countries could have a domestic impact.
""We always say measles is the canary in the coal mine and identifies weaknesses in immunization services,"" Moss says. ""We'll see continued, or more frequent importations of measles virus here in the United States.""
In an email statement,
Janeen Madan Keller
, deputy director of global health policy and a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, characterized the Trump administration's decision to eliminate funding as ""short sighted and misguided …. The impact of these cuts on children in the world's poorest countries will be devastating, likely leading to an uptick in disease and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Infectious diseases — like measles and polio — know no borders, meaning under-immunization anywhere can have consequences everywhere.""

In its first meeting with an
entirely new roster in place
, a federal panel that helps craft vaccine policy in the U.S. revealed its plans to scrutinize the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule and other priorities that reflect longstanding concerns for Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, kicked off its two-day meeting on Wednesday morning at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta.

RFK Jr.'s picks for CDC vaccine advisers meet this week amid controversy
The committee of independent experts, which offers recommendations to the CDC on the nation's vaccine schedule and immunization policy, has recently become a flashpoint.
Earlier this month, Kennedy
booted all 17 members
of the existing panel, who'd been appointed by President Joe Biden, and replaced them with a smaller selection of his own, including several who've gained a following for, at times,
promoting misleading
and inaccurate information on COVID-19 vaccines.
New workgroup will examine the vaccine schedule for kids
The meeting began with Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist formerly at Harvard Medical School who is now serving as the ACIP chair, calling for the need to ""rebuild public trust"" in federal health institutions in the wake of the pandemic and what he called the ""inflated promises"" about the COVID vaccines and mandates.
Public Health
RFK Jr. replaced everyone on the CDC's vaccine panel. Here's why that matters
In that vein, he said ACIP would establish a new workgroup to study and evaluate the cumulative effects of the recommended vaccine schedule, including the ""interaction effects between different vaccines, the total number of vaccines, cumulative amounts of vaccine ingredients and the relative timing of different vaccines.""
""The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive and what most of us in this room received when we were children,"" Kulldorff said.
Sponsor Message
Older vaccines will get another look
Another new workgroup will look specifically at ""vaccines that have not been subject to review in more than seven years,"" he said. Topics they will take up include the universal recommendation to administer the hepatitis B shot on the day of birth; how children are immunized against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chicken pox; as well as the timing of the measles vaccine to resolve religious objections among some parents.
These new areas of focus are already making some who study vaccines nervous about the future direction of ACIP.
""They're signaling interest in revisiting long-settled questions around vaccine safety, opening up issues that have been focal points of critics of vaccines for decades and giving them the legitimacy that comes with this previously well-respected government advisory committee,"" says
Jason Schwartz
, associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health
.
Kennedy's unprecedented decision to purge ACIP hinged on his claims that conflicts of interest have compromised the committee,
though NPR has found
that a government report Kennedy often cites to make his case doesn't back this up.
Along with Kulldorff, Dr. Robert Malone — another ACIP member picked by Kennedy — have both been paid to serve as expert witnesses in litigation against the vaccine maker Merck. Both said they had no conflicts of interest concerning the topics being discussed at Wednesday's meeting.
Malone said he had been through ""three months of vetting and training"" and that any potential conflicts of interest have been ""declared lacking"" by the Department of Health and Human Services and CDC.
The comment suggests that Kennedy's efforts to overhaul ACIP may have been in the works for some time, even though it was only two weeks ago that new committee members were actually appointed.
Much of the first morning of the meeting was devoted to information from CDC scientists regarding the data on COVID and vaccines against the illness. Some of the presentation seemed to directly challenge the recent decision by Kennedy and the Trump administration
to remove the recommendation
to vaccinate healthy children and pregnant women.

One slide summarizing the epidemiology indicated that most children under the age of 2 who are hospitalized had no underlying medical conditions and that outcomes among children can be ""severe, with 1 in 4 admitted to ICU."" The data also underscored the risk to children under 6 months who ""rely on the transfer of maternal antibodies"" because there are no approved shots."

RFK Jr. names new slate of vaccine advisers after purging CDC panel
The committee typically meets three times a year in public meetings to discuss and vote on how vaccines, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, should be used to protect public health.
The run-up to this week's meeting has been chaotic and controversial, according to several current and former CDC staffers who were involved in preparing for it.
It will be closely watched by those concerned about the direction of vaccine policies under Kennedy. ""It will be hard to look away,"" says
Jason Schwartz
, associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health. ""We'll see a lot about what this next chapter for vaccine policy looks like.""
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's request for comment on this story.
Fears of politicization
Kennedy's firing and replacing the entire slate of advisers shifts the fundamental purpose of the group, says Schwartz.
""This has been an apolitical group of public servants, volunteers from the scientific and medical community who have gone through their terms independent of changes in the political administration and in CDC leadership,"" he says. ""That we're thinking about 'Biden ACIP members' and 'Trump ACIP members,' that this is being viewed — like the Supreme Court — in terms of who has a majority, is unprecedented in the committee's history.""
Sponsor Message
The ACIP has played a key role in U.S. vaccine policy since it was formed in the 1960s.
At the time
, new vaccines for measles and polio had recently come online, and national health leaders felt the need for a regular panel of experts to determine how best to use these and other products to protect the public.
So they brought together specialists on medicine, public health and children's health to weigh and discuss the available evidence.
Now the committee makes recommendations that, with the CDC director's approval, become policy. Committee members help set the national vaccine schedule, which state and local jurisdictions and doctors rely on. Their votes affect which vaccines insurers will cover and the federal government will pay for, for low-income kids.
A break with precedent
In late May,
Kennedy announced
that he was changing the vaccine schedule without ACIP's input — a breach in the transparent, consensus-driven way the schedule had been made for decades.
He directed the CDC to
remove the recommendation
that children and pregnant women get routine COVID-19 vaccines.
""No one from CDC who works on vaccine policy was involved in that process. No one knew that was coming,"" says Dr. Fiona Havers, a former senior CDC official who left the agency in June. ""For RFK Jr. to be unilaterally dictating to CDC what the vaccine recommendation should be was shocking.""
For Havers, who led the team that analyzed hospitalization data for COVID and RSV and was previously scheduled to present at this week's meeting, Kennedy's subsequent firing of every ACIP committee member was the last straw.
""I knew I was done at that moment,"" she says. ""For my own scientific and personal integrity, I did not feel like I could present to this committee and help legitimize them.""

COVID vaccine changes confuse and upset some parents and families
New members with a record of questioning vaccines
Many of the panel's
eight new members
don't have deep, current expertise in vaccines. Some rose to prominence in recent years by spreading false claims about them.
For instance, Retsef Levi, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has
said on social media
that COVID vaccines are killing young people and must be stopped. Dr. Robert Malone, who
had worked on
early research into mRNA technology but is now critical of mRNA vaccines, has suggested that COVID vaccines
may cause cancer
. Neither of these claims are true.
Sponsor Message
Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist and biostatistician formerly at Harvard who will
serve as the new ACIP chair
, has been paid to serve as expert witnesses in litigation against the drug company Merck, as has Malone.
Vaccine supporters worry that this panel could be dismissive of vaccines and discourage their use.
""I don't feel like I can trust the information and recommendations from ACIP now,"" says Dr. Alexandra Cvijanovich, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, N.M., and a spokesperson for the
American Academy of Pediatrics
.
The mixed messaging from the Kennedy-led HHS is confusing for patients, she adds.
""People who have always trusted vaccines are now beginning to second-guess them,"" she says. ""And then people who have had full faith in our vaccine system are now worried that it's been taken apart with the dissolution of the original ACIP committee."" Parents have asked her about the accessibility and safety of future vaccines, she says.
Meeting agenda items raise flags
In the past, ACIP's public meetings have been reassuringly predictable. Committee members sit through data presentations, ask thoughtful questions, and vote when asked. It tends to go smoothly because it takes months to years of work behind the scenes — by committee members, CDC staff and other stakeholders — before they present a final analysis and bring a product to a vote.
Some topics were dropped from the agenda for this week's meeting,
such as discussions
on vaccines that protect against cervical cancer and pneumonia. The abrupt firing of the previous committee made it impossible for the related work groups — who can't meet without active ACIP members — to finish their work, according to current CDC staff, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the agency.
Instead, those topics have been subbed out for some long-standing priorities for people who question vaccines.

There's a vote
scheduled over thimerosal
, a preservative used in influenza vaccines. Back in the mid-to-late 1990s, there were theories that it could be a cause of autism in children.
That claim has
long been disproven
. Even so, manufacturers voluntarily removed it from childhood vaccines.
It's
used infrequently today
and there hasn't been much new research on it for years, according to
a CDC briefing
posted in the ACIP meeting materials in advance of the meeting.
Still, the group will be asked to vote on a recommendation on the topic, after reviewing a presentation by
Lyn Redwood
, a registered nurse and former president of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine advocacy group that Kennedy used to chair.
The inclusion of the MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, aka chicken pox) vaccine on the agenda also comes as a surprise to
vaccine policy experts
at the Vaccine Integrity Project, an initiative housed at the University of Minnesota that is working to
safeguard vaccine policy
and access.
Years ago, there was evidence that the MMRV vaccine was linked with seizures during fevers in some young children. The committee
addressed it then
by recommending that young kids be vaccinated separately for chicken pox — a policy that hasn't changed in more than 15 years.
""It is possible that there are new data, but CDC experts with decades of experience haven't seen them,"" says a briefing from the Vaccine Integrity Project. Still, it's up for discussion at this meeting."

How do you save the lives of over 150 million children?
The answer: Childhood vaccinations.
Just over 50 years ago, the World Health Organization launched its Essential Programme on Immunization. Since then, vaccination rates have improved dramatically and researchers estimate that 4.4 billion people have been reached and 154 million childhood deaths have been avoided.
But don't celebrate too fast.
These long-term trends obscure a less rosy picture of what's happened in recent years, according to
a study published on Tuesday in
The Lancet
.
The researchers found that, since 2010, efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places.
Sponsor Message
For example, in 100 of the 204 countries researchers looked at, the percent of kids who got the measles vaccine dropped between 2010 and 2019. In Argentina, there was a 12% drop in kids getting their first dose of the measles vaccine.
Another example: Twenty-one of 36 high-income countries saw a decline in vaccination rates for at least one of the immunizations that WHO promoted back when it launched its immunization program — vaccines to prevent such diseases as diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles and polio. Take Finland, for instance. It saw an 8% drop in the children receiving the third dose of their diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination. In Austria, there was a 6% decline.
For the study, researchers pulled together more than 1,000 sources of data — everything from household surveys to national immunization reports — to piece together what is happening around the world.
""Underpinning the work is an immense data curation effort … providing strong foundations for the study's conclusions,"" said
Edward Parker
in a statement. He was not involved in the study and is the co-director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
NPR spoke with
Dr. Jonathan Mosser
— one of the study authors and an assistant professor of health metrics sciences in the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington — to hear his thoughts about the findings.
Sponsor Message
Here are four points that stood out to Mosser.
This is ""a critical time"" when it comes to vaccines.
As Mosser and his colleagues pored over the data, he says, it was striking how much progress has been made and how many challenges the world faces.
""The past 50 years really illustrate the promise, the potential of vaccination,"" he says. ""But, there are many challenges at the moment: There are challenges related to conflict, there are challenges related to supply chains and challenges associated with vaccine misinformation.""
There are also big changes when it comes to funding for initiatives that get kids their vaccines, even if they are in low-income countries and in far-flung places. For example, the U.S. cut
its billion dollar grant to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance
, which helps get vaccines for half the world's children. However, today, the Gates Foundation announced it will give $1.6 billion over the next five years to support Gavi.
Mosser says all the changes and challenges mean the world's vaccination efforts are ""at a very critical time.""
""The world is going to have to pick a trajectory,"" he says. ""Are we going to turn our backs on one of the most remarkable public health achievements that the world has ever seen?""
India is ""a big success"" story: It's reduced the number zero-dose kids.
""
Zero-dose children
"" are those who get no vaccines at all. That number is often measured as children who are missing their first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine.
The researchers estimate that the number of kids in India who got their first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine in 2023 was 93%, which is near levels in some high-income countries.
Mosser says India stands out as a country that has achieved very high vaccination rates across a very large population ""and so that has been a big success story in the world of immunization.""
Sponsor Message
He points to not only a universal immunization effort but also a highly targeted effort, where India set out to identify populations and locations where kids weren't getting vaccines, then designed programs to close the gaps. He also says, India has leaned into tech. One example: building a fancy system to monitor their vaccine supply chain and make sure the vaccines are where they need to be exactly when they are needed.
COVID was bad for vaccination rates — but it's getting better
The COVID pandemic was a major hurdle for vaccination efforts. Health care professionals were diverted from vaccination efforts, clinics closed, imports and exports of vials and syringes were scrambled. In 2021, over 25 million children missed at least one vaccination, according to the WHO.
There's been a concerted effort to find those kids and vaccinate them. Looking at the numbers, Mosser has been pleasantly surprised.
""One thing that stood out to us is that when we had initially looked at disruptions due to the COVID pandemic — during the first couple of months of the pandemic — we had expected even larger decreases in coverage than we saw,"" he says.
""We're not back to where we need to be, but…things could have been much worse,"" he adds, crediting local outreach efforts as well as large international initiatives such as
The Big Catch-Up
spearheaded by WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a sponsor of NPR and this blog).
The world's changing birth rate presents assurances – and challenges.
The number of children born each year is expected to shrink by about 1.6% between now and 2030. But not every country is part of this trend — and that matters for vaccination efforts, says Mosser.
""In many countries where vaccine coverage is low, there has been — and continues to be — a large increase in the [population],"" Mosser says. ""And so when more children are born each year, it simply requires more resources to achieve the same levels of vaccination coverage."""

Jessica Chaikof and her older sister, Rachel, were both born deaf. At the time, the family didn't know exactly why. The girls began using cochlear implants and carried on.
""And so we pretty much lived our lives normally,"" Chaikof says.
But in 2006, when Chaikof was 11 years old, her older sister started having vision problems and was diagnosed with Usher syndrome Type 1F. It's a rare genetic disorder that causes deafness at birth, and then, over time, blindness.
""My mom didn't want to scare me, but they knew if Rachel had it, I have to have it too because it's genetic,"" she recalls.

What losing billions in federal grants means for universities, and the nation
Chaikof's now 30 years old, and a Ph.D. student at Brandeis University in the social policy program, where she focuses on disability and higher education policy. And she gets around, especially at night, with the help of a guide dog — a yellow Lab named Jigg.
Chaikof is hoping research into gene therapies could someday stop or even reverse the deterioration of her vision. But she worries that cuts to federal research funding — especially at Harvard — could mean that therapy won't be ready in time to save her sight.
""I don't want to go blind,"" Chaikof says. ""And so that progression is really scary, especially when I see the cuts by the Trump administration on research funding.""
A federal judge's ruling this week that funding should be restored for about 800 terminated NIH grants does not include the widespread cancellation of grants at Harvard University. This means that more than a billion dollars from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation that were awarded to Harvard but have not yet been spent are now unavailable.
The Trump administration has said the termination of Harvard's grants are in part because of what it sees as the university's failure to address antisemitism on campus. Usher 1F, which is thought to affect somewhere around 10 to 20 infants born in the U.S. each year, is particularly prevalent in people descended from Ashkenazi Jewish populations.

""I get really angry because the Trump administration claims they're protecting us. They're not,"" says Chaikof. ""They're actively harming us. Especially when you're attacking funds for Ashkenazi Jews, Jewish diseases.""
Chaikof's parents run a foundation called the
Usher 1F Collaborative
, which is dedicated to supporting the development of gene therapies for Usher 1F. In 2017, Dr. David Corey, a Harvard scientist who'd been studying the protein that's affected in these patients, met Jessica and her sister at a conference hosted by the foundation.
Sponsor Message
""And it was really meeting the two daughters and seeing how well they're bearing up with the challenges of the disease that we said, 'You know, we might be able to contribute something here. If we don't, who else is going to do it?'"" Corey says.
They now have a good understanding of the protein that's defective in patients with Usher 1F, Corey says.
""Because we know so much about it, we could design strategies to deliver a normal copy of this protein, first to the inner ear and then to the retina,"" he says.
It's going to take more research before they're ready to begin human trials of a gene therapy that could fix that protein in patients, Corey says.
There are no existing grants to Harvard pertaining specifically to Usher 1F — and so the cancellations haven't yet directly impacted the research — but Corey says he has two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health — and he's not optimistic about their approval.
""But even if they are scored very highly by a review committee, it's unlikely that those grants would ever be awarded to Harvard,"" he says. ""That will really slow down the research.""
Already, some of his research has come to a halt. Corey had an NIH grant terminated that was supporting basic science into the genetic mechanism of hearing.
The NIH did not respond to a request for comment.
""To be at the verge of developing therapies finally for some diseases that we could only diagnose for decades and then to have the rug pulled out from under us — for the whole scientific enterprise, not just Harvard — is really discouraging,"" Corey says.
Even so, Corey said he's optimistic Harvard's lawsuit challenging the federal funding freeze will be successful. He says when that happens, his grant applications will be there, ready for funding.

When your doctor decides you could benefit from a particular test or procedure, your insurance company might require documentation to prove it's necessary before agreeing to pay for anything.

By the end of this calendar year, federal health officials announced in a press conference Monday, the prior authorization process will be significantly better for health care providers and patients.
According to the Department of Health and Human Services and AHIP, the political advocacy and trade association for health insurers, there are six key parts of this pledge:
Standardize electronic prior authorization submissions
Reduce the number of medical services that require prior authorization
Honor existing authorizations when patients change insurance plans in the middle of ongoing treatment
Enhance transparency and communication about authorization decisions and appeals
Minimize delays with real-time approvals for most requests

Federal health officials told reporters that while this represents a voluntary commitment, they are prepared to issue new regulations if insurers don't abide by the agreement.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained that this work came about because it represented a quick way to improve the dysfunctional health insurance system.
Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, suggested another reason for taking this on.
""There's violence in the streets over these issues,"" Oz said, alluding to the
targeted killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress — as part of the
major tax and budget bill
— are poised to require certain Medicaid beneficiaries to periodically prove they are working in order to keep their insurance coverage.
""We know from research that Medicaid work requirements produce losses of insurance without producing corresponding increases in employment,"" Yaver says. If the prior authorization reforms are realized while Medicaid work requirements are instituted nationally, she says, ""I don't think it would be unfair to say that we're replacing one set of burdens with another."""

The social media platform TikTok recently banned a hashtag called #SkinnyTok after European regulators warned it was promoting
unrealistic body images
and extreme weight loss.
The company had seen an onslaught of content featuring emaciated-looking young women peddling tips on how to drop weight quickly.
Now the hashtag may be gone, but eliminating this kind of harmful content is not that simple. There's still no shortage of people — on TikTok and other social media platforms — spreading unhealthy information on how to eat fewer calories and get very, very thin.
Research shows that consuming this type of content on social media
is correlated to
a higher risk of disordered eating. Young women and girls are especially vulnerable.

But when it comes to nutrition and wellness, it can be hard to disentangle the unhealthy from the healthy.
It's Been a Minute
Men have body dysmorphia too. That's why some use this drug.
""You have many kinds of content in the gray zones,"" says
Brooke Erin Duffy
, who studies social media and culture at Cornell University. ""Their regulation is much more difficult.""
Creators are good at taking advantage of this murky ground, says Duffy. ""As soon as there is an attempt for platforms to regulate or thwart a hashtag, anyone using the platform is gonna develop a workaround,"" she says.
A popular meme called ""What I eat in a day,"" for example, features people showing their daily food intake. Posts can either feature a balanced diet or one that could put someone in a dangerous calorie deficit. One young woman recently posted a video showing the single croissant she subsisted on in a day, whereas a different woman featured a balance of lean proteins and vegetables adding up to 1,800 calories.
Body-positive counterprogramming
Some creators on the front lines of the body image battle are making their own counterprogramming. Athlete and creator Kate Glavan — who has nearly 150,000 followers — urges her followers to take seriously the dangers of content that glamorizes undernourishment.  She discusses her own struggle with an eating disorder in her videos.

""A lot of creators are explicitly promoting anorexia to their audience,"" Glavan says in
a recent TikTok video
. ""It's dangerous. It's misinformed,"" she says, and she advises people to ""block these creators.""
Research shows that anorexia has
the highest mortality rate
of any psychiatric disorder.
But researchers who study this issue say
body-positive content
doesn't garner the same kinds of audiences — or profit. ""Negative images that are unrealistic or show really thin people or really muscular people tend to have a more lasting impact than body-positive content
,""
says Amanda Raffoul,
who researches eating disorders and social media at the University of Toronto.
NPR's Book of the Day
'Fatty Fatty Boom Boom' details a lifelong relationship with food and body image
Messaging that equates thinness with beauty is reinforced throughout society, Raffoul says.
Raffoul points to
research that suggests
consumption of body-positive content on social media does not necessarily provide protection against or counteract content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards or weight loss.
""The way that they structure content and the way that they code algorithms to amplify certain types of messaging and even target certain types of messaging to specific users puts that information in the hands of more vulnerable people,"" Raffoul says.
Even though platforms aren't creating content, says Raffoul, they are responsible for how
aggressively they amplify
different kinds of messaging or direct it at certain demographics.
TikTok declined a request for an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement stressed that they ""regularly review safety measures to address evolving risks and have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content."" Searches on the platform for this term are redirected to the
National Alliance for Eating Disorders

Among other safety strategies, the company says it continues to restrict videos for teen accounts and redirect searches to health experts, as well as partner with advocacy groups that offer strategies around recognizing and treating eating disorders.

Have the new weight-loss drugs changed what it means to be body positive?
While Crabbe still creates content on social media, she says it's harder to break through with messaging that normalizes bigger bodies than it was a few years ago. She is glad to see #Skinnytok banned, but she says she sees a need for more soul searching on the question of beauty standards from Western culture.  ""I think banning the hashtag is a surface-level plaster to a very deep wound,"" she says. ""We are still deeply fat phobic as a society.""
Some content creators say the uphill battle against negative content around eating and skinny bodies is exhausting. ""I don't really claim it anymore,"" says
Nyome Nicholas-Williams,
of the term ""body positivity."" Nicholas-Williams — a Black woman and a plus-size model — says she feels pushed out of the movement that Black women started but she says has since
been co-opted
. ""I'm more of like 'body neutrality,'"" she says.
In 2020, Nicholas-Williams
publicly took on
the social media platform Instagram, accusing the company of censoring content featuring Black plus-size models with different standards than those it used to police content featuring white, slim people. The company issued an apology and pledged to change its policies.
Nicholas-Williams says some of her public criticism of the social media platform has likely cost her business, but she thinks speaking out against dangerous content is an important strategy in combating it.  ""People speaking up and being brave,"" she says, ""that's what it takes.""

Raffoul believes it will take lawmakers forcing change in order to create meaningful protection from dangerous content through these new channels.
Until that happens, she says, the best strategy to combat it is not to look at it at all."

When the Supreme Court
overturned
Roe V. Wade
in 2022, the ruling didn't just eliminate the federal right to abortion; it also ushered in ""a generational change in the way that people approach sex,"" journalist

Sherman is a reproductive health and justice reporter at
The Guardian
where she's covered the real-world results of abortion bans, access to healthcare for trans people, and how technology is reshaping our view of our bodies and our choices. In her new book,
The Second Coming: Sex and the Next Generation's Fight Over its Future,
Sherman writes that Gen Z — which the Pew Research Center defines as
people born between 1997 and 2012
— are having less sex than previous generations.

Sherman conducted more than 100 interviews with teenagers, young adults and experts for the book. She says the decline of interest in sex goes beyond the issue of abortion rights.
""We have the rise of the internet, smartphones, social media, porn. We have

On young people learning about sex from porn
Something I really wanted to do in the book is to understand what the internet is teaching young people about sex. And in previous generations, you might be limited to seeing sex glimpsed through your father's
Playboy
that he left behind. But today, you can turn on your computer or look at your phone and Google for any kind of sex you want, and probably a few that you don't.
What I found really interesting in talking to young people about porn is that I had sort of expected a range of perspectives on it. I had thought that some people, particularly people who are on the Left, would have more of a warm view of it. People on the Right would be more anti-porn. But instead what I found is that young people felt really bad about their relationship with porn. And they felt that porn had warped them sexually and normalized particularly ""rough sex"" in such a way that they felt like their sex lives had been transformed forever by it.

What sex educators who I talked to really tried to emphasize when they talked to young people is, like, this is Hollywood. You don't see people driving cars in an action movie and think, oh I should drive my car that way. But because we have so eliminated the possibility of comprehensive sex ed in so many schools, this is really the only outlet that a lot of young people have to not only look at porn, but to look at in particular what sexual pleasure looks like. How do I make someone feel good? How do I make myself feel good? Those are questions that porn is not shy about answering, but doesn't always provide the best answers to.

On the lasting impact of the #MeToo movement for girls
Law
Harvey Weinstein's new trial is almost over. It could be a litmus test for #MeToo
For a lot of young women, what the Me Too movement did was help them understand that it was unfair that they were haunted by their early sexual experiences. They understood, I think far earlier than certainly I did, and far earlier then a lot of older generations, that if something had happened to them that they felt might be sort of off, that in fact it could have been sexual assault or sexual harassment and that it is wrong, that they deserve better resources. Because at the same time though, what Me Too did not do was really lead to mass institutional change. The biggest lasting reforms that came out of the Me Too movement were things that had to do with workplaces, with having better HR trainings, with reforming NDAs. And so for many of the young women, in particular who I spoke with, they were left with this understanding that, ""OK, sexual harassment and assault is everywhere and it's wrong, but I don't actually have ways to fix that situation if something bad happens to me."" And that ultimately creates anxiety, right? If you're walking around feeling like the world is very dangerous, that's not good for the way that you try to live your life.
On the trend of young men moving to the Right and feeling demonized
There was one young man who I really appreciated how straightforward he was about this, where he is a reproductive justice advocate. He's a Democrat. He very much believes in the Me Too movement's mission, but he did tell me that he felt that it could be very anti-cis male. And I think that this is a feeling that a lot of young men felt where they were made to feel like they were the bad guys, that they had done something wrong, even if they felt like they never had, or that they were going to be bad guys just by virtue of being men. ... In the 2024 elections, as we saw a shocking number of men turn out for Trump. Normally, young men behave like young people, which is to say that they are on the Left. But instead, what we're seeing among young men is that they're behaving more like men, which is say that are moving to the Right.
Politics
Young men swung for Trump in 2024. Democrats are working on a plan to win them back
And I wanted to just emphasize, though, that there is this resentfulness that's happening among young men and then there is this fear that's still happening among young women. I think for me in reporting this book, the things I was trying to hold in my mind is understanding like, OK, young men might have felt like they were demonized, and maybe they really were demonize by this movement, but on the other hand, the dangers that are facing young women are so real. And in fact, the dangers that are are facing men are still more real. False accusations of sexual assault are extremely uncommon. Men are more likely to be sexually assaulted than they are to be falsely accused of sexual assault. And I think in this sort of rightward push by men, that truth can get obscured. The fact that men, too, can be victims and that they, too deserve resources if something goes wrong, that is being pushed aside.

Everyone knows the feeling: tossing and turning during a hot, sticky night when sleep feels impossible.
It's hard for anyone to sleep well when it's hot out. And the disruptions are growing, especially for those suffering from sleep apnea, as climate change pushes up temperatures day and night around the globe. A
new study
published in the journal
Nature Communications
found that the chance of having any kind of sleep apnea problem overnight goes up by almost 50% when it's 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, compared to when temperatures are in the 50s.
And the severe cases — when people stop breathing more than 30 times in a single hour — go up, too. ""You also increase the likelihood of having severe sleep apnea by 40%,"" says Bastien Lechat, a sleep expert at Flinders University in Australia and the lead author of the new study. ""It's a striking number.""
Sponsor Message
In sleep apnea, people's breathing stops and starts while they rest. The disorder can keep people's bodies from getting enough oxygen and disrupts sleep. An estimated
one billion people
worldwide deal with sleep apnea, though it's underdiagnosed, says Lechat. And the impacts of so much disrupted sleep are hefty. People's moods and ability to work are affected, and sleep loss contributes to many other health problems from heart attacks to strokes.
""We all know what it means to have a bad night of sleep,"" says Sara Mednick, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But science shows that the cumulative impacts of bad sleep, she says, trickle out beyond the person feeling tired. ""It's a whole global problem that we need to really think about,"" she says.
The study used about two years of sleep data from more than 125,000 people, in 41 different countries worldwide.The data tracked detected sleep disruptions with sensors placed under people's mattresses and tracked changes in sleep apnea incidents over time, and compared that sleep data with temperature where people lived. As temperatures climbed, people's sleep apnea got worse.
The risk of having a severe sleep apnea event when it was very hot out nearly doubled in many northern countries, like Europe and Russia. It went up by about 40% in countries like the U.S.
Sponsor Message
Lechat thinks the differences might stem from air conditioning access — one factor the study couldn't take into account. Fewer people in Europe use air conditioners than in the U.S. or Australia, leaving people exposed to the full impact of hotter temperatures day and night.
Climate change has pushed up global temperatures over the past few decades, and that extra heat is costing people sleep already, the study found. The U.K, for example, has warmed just over a degree Fahrenheit since 2000; the overall health cost from heat-worsened sleep apnea issues grew by more than 90% as time passed and temperatures climbed. As temperatures rise further, the impacts will also grow, Mednick says .
""As temperature gets higher, our sleep quality gets lower,"" she says. And that means ""we are just going to continue to lose sleep"" as climate change marches forward.
Other recent studies found that climate change is disrupting sleep for people without disorders like sleep apnea, too.
A study
using millions of Fitbit sleep records worldwide found that people fell asleep later, woke up earlier, and slept more poorly as temperatures went up — and that people didn't get better at dealing with the heat over time.
Another study
in China found that a 10-degree Celsius (18-degree Fahrenheit) jump in temperatures cut sleep time by about 10 minutes per night in China.
The message from those studies, and the new research, is unambiguous, says Nick Obradovich, a data scientist at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Oklahoma, who worked on several sleep-and-climate focused studies in the past but was not involved in the new study. ""As temperatures increase, people sleep less well across all the measures, across all the places that we've seen so far.""
To reclaim good sleep, Obradovich says, the first goal is stopping temperatures from rising more. But controlling your sleep environment likely helps too, by cooling it down with fans or air conditioning.

""My worry is for people who can't do that,"" Lechat says. For people in vast swaths of Earth without access to cooling, the future looks hotter and filled with more sleep disruptions."

Here are facts to know about these biting critters and tips to stay safe.
Ticks are slow threats, so prompt action cuts your risk
With ticks — unlike mosquitoes with their one-and-done sting — there are generally multiple opportunities to reduce your risks. That's because most kinds of ticks need to crawl onto your body, latch into the skin and, in many cases, feed for a while — from several hours to several days — before they get you sick.

Once called Nantucket fever, this nasty tick-borne illness is on the rise
Risks differ in the North, South and West
The risks of getting a tick-borne disease like Lyme or relapsing fever vary by region, depending on what ticks are around, what they're carrying, and how likely they are to come in contact with humans.
To see which tick-borne diseases have been found in your area, you can check historic data (2019-2022) by county
on a CDC map
, and in many cases, state and local health department websites, says
Thomas Hart
, an infectious disease microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies Lyme disease.
Broadly, the CDC divides the country into three regions when it comes to ticks:
North:
Tick bites are most common in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest, with nearly 20% of people getting them each year, and much of the region is considered to be at high risk for Lyme disease, according to
research from the CDC
.
The bacteria that causes Lyme,
Borrelia burgdorferi,
is the
most common pathogen
carried by deer ticks in this region — up to 30% of ticks in the nymphal stage and up to 60% of adult ticks carry it, says Rebecca Eisen, a research biologist in the Division of Vector-borne Diseases at the CDC.
Ticks in this area carry other pathogens, but far less commonly — 2% to 6% of ticks may be carrying bacteria that cause
anaplasmosis
,
babesiosis
or
relapsing fever
, she says.

South:
In the Central and Southeastern parts of the U.S. (including Texas), around 13% of people report getting tick bites. There,
ehrlichiosis
,
spotted fever rickettsioses
and the allergic condition
alpha-gal syndrome
are the top concerns.
The somewhat lower incidence of tick bites in Southern states may be related to
how the tick populations behave
, Eisen says. In Northern states, they tend to crawl up to the surface of leaf litter and tall grasses, while in Southern states, they stay closer to the soil level, making them less likely to cling onto a human arm or leg. Eisen says these differences are likely driven by genetics, based on how generations of ticks changed over time. ""I think it's just a function of what survived,"" she says.
West:
In Western states (including California), tick bites are considerably less common, but they do happen — around 6% of people report getting them, according to CDC research. Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are some of the diseases
people get there

What to do if you get bitten
If you do get bitten, you should remove the tick right away. Don't toss it immediately, advises Mather at URI, because identifying some key information about the tick can help determine your risks. That includes what kind of tick it is, whether it's in the nymph or adult stage and how long it's been feeding on you.
Shots - Health News
Ticks suck. Here's a guide to identifying them and avoiding bites
To figure this out, you can
compare what you find
with diagrams provided by the URI's Tick Encounter website. If you get stuck, you can submit a
clear photo of your tick
from the top, and Mather and his team will try to help figure it out.
Or take your tick — wrapped in tape, or in a plastic bag — to the doctor if you're seeking medical care. Seeing what type of tick it is and how long it's fed on you can help medical providers determine if you're at risk of Lyme or other diseases, Hinckley says.

But sending them in for testing
isn't all that helpful
, according to the CDC, because the results often don't lead to actionable advice. If the tick is positive for a pathogen, it
doesn't necessarily mean
you've been infected. And if you do develop symptoms of a tick-borne disease, you're better off seeking medical treatment right away instead of waiting for the tick testing results.
When to seek medical care
In places where Lyme disease is common, finding an engorged adult deer tick (
like the ones pictured here
) could mean you should seek care right away.
""The only time you would get an antibiotic, after a tick bite and before any symptoms, would be to prevent Lyme disease,"" says Hinckley with the CDC. ""And in that case, we recommend just a single dose.""
In most other cases, you may be advised to monitor yourself for symptoms in the days and weeks after the bite.
""In a lot of cases, if you're seeing something right away after a tick bite, it could just be a hypersensitivity reaction — a little redness — that doesn't require a visit to a health care provider,"" Hinckley says. ""But if it's a few days later and you start to experience aches and pains, fever, and — for a lot of these different tick borne diseases — a rash can occur. For those symptoms, seeing a health care provider as soon as you can would be important.""
Hinckley recommends telling the provider about your tick bite, your symptoms and where you were — the state, the county — when you picked up the tick. ""It can help them decide what diseases you might be at risk for,"" she says.
It's a lot to figure out on your own, so you can check the University of Rhode Island's
TickEncounter
and the CDC's
Tick Bite Bot
for help determining next steps.

Ticks-borne diseases are spreading to new areas — stay informed
Ticks and the diseases they carry are on the rise, and on the move. In the past 20 years, scientists have
discovered at least
seven new tick-borne pathogens in the U.S., and reported cases of disease have more than doubled, according to a 2024 CDC report.
Changes in climate, particularly warming in the Northern Hemisphere, play a big role in expanding the areas where ticks can survive, says
Nicole Baumgarth
, director of Johns Hopkins University's Lyme and Tickborne Diseases Research and Education Institute. So does reforestation, which brings more deer, birds and rodents. ""When we live in these wooded areas, we are really getting into the way of millions of years of evolution between the ticks, the mammals and the bacterium,"" she says.
People and their medical providers are also more aware of ticks in their areas and the diseases they carry, which leads to more cases being confirmed, Baumgarth says.
But there are risks coming to new areas that weren't seen before. Since the early 1990s, Lyme disease has gone from being ""really unknown"" to becoming established in
parts of southern Canada
, says Baumgarth.
And the mid-Atlantic recently saw its first fatal case of
Heartland Virus
. ""The fact that we are now seeing these virus infections in areas where we haven't seen them before is probably a tip of the iceberg,"" Baumgarth says, since it likely means there are more cases that aren't being diagnosed.
Researchers in the South and West are also tracking
soft-tick relapsing fever
, a condition caused by the bites of soft-bodied ticks, which lack a hard shell and tend to be found in areas where bats and rodents live. While just
250 cases were reported
to the CDC from 2012-2021, the symptoms — high fevers, chills, nausea — can be often misdiagnosed as influenza, COVID-19, even malaria, says
Job Lopez
, a tick researcher at Baylor College of Medicine."

In southern Colorado's San Luis Valley, clouds billow above the towering mountains of the Sangre de Cristo range. A chorus of blackbirds whistle, as they flit among the reeds of a wildlife refuge. Big circular fields of crops, interspersed with native shrubs, give it a feel of bucolic quiet.
Despite the stark beauty in one of the state's most productive agricultural regions, there's a sense of unease among the community's leaders as Congress debates a budget bill that could radically reshape Medicaid, the government health program for low-income people.
""I'm trying to be worried — and optimistic,"" said Konnie Martin, CEO of
San Luis Valley Health in Alamosa
. It's the flagship health care facility for 50,000 people in six agricultural counties — Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, Mineral, Rio Grande and Saguache.

deep Medicaid cuts
were ""incredibly frightening,"" Martin said, ""because Medicaid is such a vital program to rural health care.""

Martin's hospital is not alone. ""I think in Colorado right now, nearly 70 percent of rural hospitals are operating in a negative margin,"" in the red, Martin said.
Across the hall from her office is Shane Mortensen, the chief financial officer. ""The bean counter,"" he said with a slight grin.
The hospital's annual budget is $140 million, and Medicaid revenues make up nearly a third of that, according to Mortensen.
The operating margin is razor thin, so federal cuts to Medicaid could force difficult cuts. ""It will be devastating to us,"" Mortensen said.
Lifeline for health care
The region
is one of the state's poorest. Two in five of Alamosa County's residents are enrolled in
Health First Colorado
, the state's Medicaid program.
It's a lifeline, especially for people who wouldn't otherwise have easy access to health care. That includes low-income seniors who need supplemental coverage over and above Medicare, and people of all ages with disabilities. More than 2,500 working age adults in the county with incomes lower than $20,820 a year also qualify, and would be among those most likely to lose coverage under current proposals.

Or go without. Across the state, Medicaid covers
one in five Coloradans
, more than a million people.
That includes children in foster care.
""We've had 13 kids in and out of our home, six of which have been born here at this hospital with drugs in their system,"" said Chance Padilla, a foster parent. ""Medicaid has played a huge part in just being able to give them the normal life that they deserve.""
He and his husband, Chris, who are both clinic managers, get reimbursed by Medicaid for the costs of providing for the kids that have lived with them. ""These kids require a lot of medical intervention,"" said Chance Padilla.
The program also covers mental health services for foster children. ""At one point, we had a preteen that needed to be seen three times a week by a mental health professional,"" Chris Padilla said. ""There's no way that we could have done that without Medicaid.""
What happens to cancer and maternity care?

""If we don't have obstetric services here, then where are they going to go?"" Hernandez asked. ""They're going to travel an hour and 20 minutes north to Salida to get health care, or they can travel to Pueblo, another two hour drive over a mountain pass to get health care.""
Tiffany Martinez, 34, works with kids who have disabilities. She was recently forced to think about that possibility after giving birth to her fourth child, Esme, three weeks ago.
Her pregnancy was high risk, requiring twice-a-week ultrasounds and stress tests at the hospital. She's enrolled in Medicaid and said it's critical for many moms in the valley.
""Everything down here is low pay,"" said Martinez. ""It's not like we have money to just be able to pay for the doctor. It's not like we have money to travel often to go to the doctor, so it's definitely beneficial.""
About 85 percent of the hospital's labor and delivery patients are covered by Medicaid. As the program has expanded over the years, many of the patients who got added were married women from working families.
""It impacted the whole family because of course that's a little nucleus then that grows with the care of the family and the well-being of the family,"" said Christine Hettinger-Hunt, the hospital's chief operating officer.

Hospital heals, and also employs
With 750 workers, the hospital is the valley's largest employer. One of those employees is Dr. Clint Sowards, a primary care physician. He grew up in the region, went away for school and came back to a good-paying job.
Sowards is focused on the fact that fewer Medicaid funds will make it harder to attract the next generation of doctors, nurses and other health providers.
Certain medical specialties might no longer be available, Sowards explained. ""People will have to leave. They will have to leave the San Luis Valley.""
Dr. Kristina Steinberg is a family medicine physician with
Valley Wide Health Systems
, a network of small clinics serving thousands. She said Medicaid covers most nursing home residents in the area. ""If seniors lost access to Medicaid for long-term care, we would lose some nursing homes,"" she said. ""They would consolidate.""
The program also pays for vaccines for children. In two nearby communities, Colorado recently
recorded its first cases of measles
this year, which is highly contagious.
""If you are on Medicaid, you don't have any insurance, you pretty much qualify for free vaccines for children,"" Steinberg said. ""And I can see our vaccines dropping off dramatically if people have to pay for vaccines, because some of them are very expensive.""
Medicaid sustains a local level of health care that is then available to the wider population, including patients on Medicare and commercial insurance, according to administrators and clinicians.
""We really utilize Medicaid as sort of the backbone of our infrastructure,"" said Audrey Reich Loy, a licensed social worker and the hospital's director of programs.
""It doesn't just support those that are recipients of Medicaid, but as a result of what it brings to our community, it allows us to ensure that we have sort of a safety net of services that we can then expand upon and provide for the entire community.""

Seeking more efficiency
Republicans in Congress say they want to save money and make the government more efficient. Their budget would
cut taxes
by trillions of dollars — and
possibly cut social safety net programs
like Medicaid.
Many in this region
voted for President Trump
— in Alamosa County, he topped 54 percent. Hernandez admits Medicaid cuts could give people here second thoughts.
""He's potentially affecting his voter base pretty dramatically,"" said Hernandez, noting politics is a sensitive topic that he mostly doesn't discuss with patients. ""I can't imagine that hasn't crossed some people's minds.""
Sowards, the family medicine physician, says he's baffled by the idea of potentially slashing Medicaid spending. He understands that some people believe the Medicaid system is ailing and costly. But he has grave doubts about the proposed cure.
""Just because we fall and break our wrists and our wrist is broken, doesn't mean that we need to cut off our arm, okay?,"" he said. ""Losing Medicaid would have drastic repercussions that we can't foresee.""
Local economy depends on health care
Deep Medicaid cuts could pack a punch for the wider regional economy as well.
The small city of Alamosa is the hub of the San Luis Valley. It has a main street in the midst of
revitalization
. It has hotels, restaurants, shops and a coffee shop called
Roast Cafe
.
On a recent Wednesday, barista Ethan Bowen prepped a specialty drink called a Drooling Moose. ""It's a white chocolate mocha with a little bit of caramel in there,"" he said.
The coffee shop and its adjacent brew pub do pretty good business here — in part because of foot traffic from nearby San Luis Valley Health, which is a ""huge part of the local economy,"" Bowen said.
Joe Martinez is president of

He said the valley is home to three of the poorest counties in the nation. A lot of its people are enrolled in Medicaid ""and the individuals that partake in the program don't necessarily have the financial means to travel outside of the San Luis Valley for health care.""
Cuts would hit hard
The hospital's regional economic impact is
more than $100 million a year
, with Medicaid accounting for a major part of that, Martinez said.
Any Medicaid cuts would hit the hospitals hard, but also affect small businesses and their employees. The region is already feeling economic stress from other changes, like recent cuts the Trump administration made to the federal workforce.
The San Luis Valley is home to the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge, Great San Dunes National Park and other federally-managed lands.
Martinez said recently laid off federal workers are already coming to banks, saying, ""'Can I find a way to get my next two months mortgage payments forgiven? Or can we do an extension? Or I lost my job, what can we do to make sure that I don't lose my vehicle?'""

, traveled to Washington, D.C., in April to talk to the state's Congressional delegation. He said his message about Medicaid cuts was straightforward: ""It can have a devastating economic impact."" Coleman put together a long list of possible troubles: more chronic disease and mortality, longer wait times for care, medical debt and financial strain on families.
Downtown Alamosa, a hub for the San Luis Valley's agricultural economy, is also home to breweries, coffee houses, retail, and public art.

Cuts would create ripple effect
Medicaid cuts indirectly can impact other economic sectors, like education.
""One of the biggest factors driving state higher education funding down
is state spending on health care,"" said David Tandberg, president of
Adams State University
in Alamosa. The college has roughly 3000 students and is next door to the hospital. It's the region's second-largest employer.

If federal cuts are made to Medicaid, Tandberg said, the state of Colorado will then be forced to pay more to maintain health care services. This year, Colorado is facing a billion-dollar budget deficit. Public universities like his will find they're competing with medical institutions for precious state funding. ""So anytime I hear about Medicaid cuts, it makes me nervous,"" he said."

For nearly four years, Dr. Maya Bass's commute included a monthly plane ride from Philadelphia to Oklahoma to provide abortions at a clinic there. Starting in 2018, she took these trips even though flying made her nauseous and she had to use vacation time from her regular job. Bass was motivated to fill a gap: Oklahoma — like all parts of the U.S. outside of a fraction of metropolitan areas —
has long had a shortage of abortion providers
.

There, she realized the connection between an abortion provider and patient can be deep. ""I want to be that provider who lets people feel heard and helps break that stigma,"" she says.

The Network: Saint-o-tec
Since the 1970s, legal abortions in the U.S. have taken place at brick-and-mortar facilities across the country, like the one where Bass practiced in Oklahoma. But that began to change in the early 2020s. Between the COVID pandemic and the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning
Roe v. Wade
, doctors had to rethink what a safe abortion looked like. The evidence for how to have
safe and effective abortions outside the clinical setting
was waiting for them.
A Medication Revolution, Despite Barriers
If what you picture when you think of an abortion is a woman in a medical gown, undergoing a procedure, that's far from the norm today. Medication abortion — taking pills to end a pregnancy —
now makes up 63 percent of all abortions in the country
. The first time Bass counseled someone through a medication abortion, she remembers how simple and straightforward it was.
Embedded
The Network: Breaking Bread
""Being able to just tell someone how to take pills and then know that the issue they were dealing with would be resolved just felt like such a great contribution to health care,"" she recalls.
To perform a medication abortion, which is approved in the U.S. through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, Bass gave patients two drugs: misoprostol and mifepristone.
The medications each play a different role in an abortion and have different histories. Misoprostol, which causes contractions that empty the uterus, has multiple medical uses, including treating ulcers. Starting in the mid-1980s,
women in Latin America — a region that had widespread abortion restrictions — noticed that miscarriage was a side effect of misoprostol.
Underground networks emerged there to help women use the drug for abortion. In the U.S., misoprostol is prescribed off-label for abortion and other gynecological purposes.
Sponsor Message
Mifepristone, in contrast, stops the pregnancy from progressing by blocking an important hormone. It was developed in a French laboratory with the express purpose of causing abortions.
The Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 but with a caveat: doctors had to follow stringent guidelines when they prescribed medication abortion. Those came to be known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (or REMS), which are typically reserved for drugs that are highly addictive, like fentanyl, or dangerous, like cancer drugs. Mifepristone is neither.
Bass says she found some of these rules unnecessarily burdensome.
For instance, because of the REMS, patients had to schedule an appointment and come to the clinic to get the mifepristone; they couldn't pick up the pills from a pharmacy at their convenience.
Mifepristone is one of the pills used in medication abortions.

On top of the federal regulations, Bass had to follow state-level requirements from Oklahoma. One of them, which was the case for several states at the time, required patients to swallow the mifepristone in front of her.
""I have to watch you take this specific pill,"" she says. ""It is a little silly.""
But Bass supported some of the rules she had to follow. Clinics created exhaustive standards of care to comply with the REMS and to reduce their legal risk. They included a mandatory ultrasound to date the pregnancy and bloodwork to check for medical risk factors.
Bass followed up these physical exams with counseling that helped patients understand what to expect and what signs indicated something might be going wrong.
After attending all of these appointments, undergoing tests, and paying for the pills, patients went home to manage the abortion — a process that involves cramping and bleeding that can take more than 24 hours. For Bass, this introduced risk and uncertainty.
""I think a lot of our protocols are created so that we don't have to trust that our patients know when to advocate for themselves. We can just confirm, at every state of the process, that this is fine,"" she says.
Sponsor Message
Despite finding aspects of the REMS unnecessary, overall Bass considered the protocol to be good doctoring — until she encountered an alternative.
Out of the Clinic, Onto the Internet
Throughout the 2010s, American women started to lose access to doctors who could give them an abortion. During this period, states passed hundreds of new restrictions that closed clinics and shortened the time frame women had to get an abortion.
Abortion rights advocates started looking for an alternative. Elisa Wells, a public health researcher and one of the founders of the organization
Plan C
, had worked in international settings and had seen how freely available abortion pills were in some other countries.
Wells and her team started looking into access in the U.S. They discovered one place where you could purchase pills without a prescription: the internet.
""There were people in chat rooms that were asking, 'How can I get abortion pills?' And people were desperate to know this information. They couldn't afford the cost of a clinic… the $500-$600 it was going to take to get these pills,"" she says. ""And so they saw these other pills online and wondered 'Were they real? Would they arrive? Am I going to be scammed?'""
Wells and her colleagues set out to answer these questions. She found 18 websites selling pills. She recalls that the sites looked ""a little sketchy,"" but she decided to test-purchase pills anyway. She entered her credit card information and waited, doubtful that they would arrive.
But a couple weeks later a package appeared at her door. Inside were the abortion pills. ""It was amazing to me that these pills actually came,"" Wells says.
Wells had them tested at a lab to check if they were real and presented her findings at the National Abortion Federation meeting in 2017.
Sponsor Message
""There was a bit of buzz ahead of time,"" she recalls. ""People were pretty convinced that the research was gonna show that these pills were fake."" Then Wells and her team revealed the results of the lab tests:
the pills were real.
""There was an audible gasp in the room,"" Wells says. ""People realized how transformative that could be to abortion access in the United States."" She even remembers some applause.
But as news spread throughout the abortion rights community, not everyone was celebrating.
At medical conferences across the country, clinicians who supported abortion rights began having heated debates about self-managed medication abortion — getting abortion pills without a prescription and taking them without a doctor's oversight. Jen Karlin, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, became interested in the disagreement.
Self-managed medication abortion ""was starting to make some people uncomfortable… People felt it was really unsafe,"" she says. ""I wanted to talk with clinicians about this to find out what is at stake here? Are you really worried about the safety of this? And if you are, what aspect of the safety of this are you worried about?""
In 2019, Karlin turned these questions into
a study
. First, she surveyed 40 clinicians who provide abortion and asked what they thought about self-managing.

Half of these doctors believed self-managed abortions were safe, effective and empowering. Nearly half were ambivalent.
Bass, the abortion provider who regularly flew to Oklahoma, participated in the study, and she fell into this latter category. She pictured worst-case scenarios for women who self-managed. ""What if they have a septic abortion? What if they take the medication wrong and they hurt themselves?"" she says.
After the survey, Karlin gave participants a fact-sheet. It summarizes nearly two dozen peer-reviewed articles on the safety and effectiveness of people managing a medication abortion without going to a clinic or seeing a doctor.
Sponsor Message
The studies on that sheet spanned decades and the globe.
Bass later read through every article footnoted in the fact sheet, all 23 of them.
""Wow, this is real,"" she remembers thinking.
Some of the studies directly challenged the multi-step protocol Bass adhered to when prescribing abortion medication. For instance, one study found that
an ultrasound wasn't necessary
to determine patients' gestational age in early pregnancy; patients' reported last period was usually accurate enough.
Other studies
found that an in-person follow-up appointment to make sure the abortion was complete also
wasn't essential
. Together, the studies suggested that the extensive safety measures doctors followed weren't necessary for all patients.
Though many of the participants in Karlin's study were struck by the fact-sheet's overwhelming evidence, another exercise in the study is what tended to change their minds: Karlin asked them to
reflect on their values
, in light of what they'd just learned.
One doctor realized that her discomfort with self-managed abortion wasn't really about safety. She felt that supporting her patients in person was the best part of her job, and self-managed abortion would take that away from her.
Karlin recalls the abortion provider saying, ""I went into this trying to provide quality care, evidence-based care… But then I realized that it's not about me, it's actually about centering the patient.""
Several participants, including Bass, realized that requiring a doctor to be involved actually limited abortion access.
The Pandemic Greases the Wheels
The evidence summarized in Karlin's fact sheet had been around for decades. But it took a global pandemic for that research to translate into policy.
COVID-19 made in-person contact risky, so, Karlin says, ""All of a sudden, the health care profession is saying… 'Do we really need that person to come in and do that test… that ultrasound?' And lo and behold, there's all this evidence already out there that no, they don't.""
Sponsor Message
In 2020, the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the FDA for putting doctors and abortion patients at risk. In response, the FDA walked back its regulations.
In 2021, the FDA announced that it would
stop enforcing the REMS for mifepristone
— more than two decades after the regulations had been introduced. Patients were no longer federally required to go to a clinic to get abortion pills. They could simply fill out a form online or attend a virtual appointment and then get the pills mailed to them.
During the pandemic, Karlin returned to the doctors she had surveyed in 2019 to see if their views about self-managed abortion had shifted. Some told her they were now even more convinced it was safe for patients to have abortions with less medical oversight because they'd seen the evidence through their patients' experiences.
Half of the people she had surveyed who had thought it was necessary to do an ultrasound to determine gestational age no longer did. The fraction of clinicians who believed patients needed an ultrasound to make sure the abortion was complete also dropped, down to 5 percent.
Even after the FDA revised its policies, only about two-thirds of states allow telehealth for medication abortion. But it was still a dramatic shift.
Although some doctors would prefer to see patients in person, the shift to telehealth got many clinicians thinking outside of the box on how to create access to abortion despite barriers. It's an approach they would use again when abortion seekers faced another barrier to clinic access.
The Fall of Roe
After participating in Karlin's study and changing her mind about self-managed medication abortion, Bass looked for ways to support people who took pills on their own.
In the fall of 2019, she joined a group of clinicians who were establishing the
Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline
, or the M+A Hotline.

Bass took an 18-hour shift, two to four times a month. In some ways the calls on the hotline were similar to the counseling she'd been doing in a clinic.

""Most of what we do is reassure,"" Bass says ""I would say the vast majority of the calls I'm dealing with are people just being like, 'Hey, can you tell me if it worked? Or can you tell me if this is too much bleeding?'""
Bass was surprised to find that the conversations on the hotline could feel more intimate than those in the clinic. She thinks patients open up more because both they and the doctor are anonymous.
Bass remembers one woman who called in the middle of the night confiding in her, saying: ""I haven't told anybody. I feel so alone. I don't know anybody else to talk to.""
""Those experiences are why I kept doing it,"" Bass says. ""Because it's very infrequent that you feel like you can make that much of an impact on a person.""
After
Roe
was overturned in 2022, Oklahoma banned abortion, and the clinic there where Bass worked stopped providing abortions. Her monthly trips stopped. Unable to practice in person, the hotline gave her a sense of purpose.
It also changed her understanding of why someone would self-manage their abortion. Before joining the hotline, she assumed self-managing was an act of desperation, a last resort. But that wasn't always the case.
She got calls from women in states with abortion protections, who opted to self-manage because they found it more convenient or affordable.
Bass knows that self-managed abortion can't replace all abortions – for instance, emergency cases or certain medical risk factors still require a clinician. And sometimes people just want a doctor involved. But the hotline led her to appreciate doctoring in a de-medicalized setting without unnecessary ultrasounds or bloodwork. For the first time, she was able to
care for people

In the last few years, the broader medical community, including the World Health Organization, has
declared self-managed abortion to be a safe and effective
method in the first trimester.
Many American doctors agree. In 2024, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
put out a statement in support of self-managed abortion
. It called on doctors to educate themselves and provide support for patients who do it.
Since the Supreme Court overturned
Roe
, the hotline has only grown. It now has dozens of volunteers, including clinicians as well as people who provide logistical support. The hotline gets thousands of calls and texts every month.

Other doctors contributed to a demedicalized model in another way — using telehealth to prescribe pills from states with abortion protections, called shield laws, to people in states with restrictions or bans.
Doctors' embrace of telehealth has led to an increase in the number of abortions in the U.S. In fact, research has shown that
telehealth is one of the main reasons for this rise
.
But access to these demedicalized options may be more fragile than it seems.
In her study, Karlin found that some clinicians weren't swayed to support self-managed abortion. It wasn't because they thought self-managed or telehealth abortion was dangerous –
they worried about the political consequences
.
""When and if something goes wrong — which it will, because with medicine, something goes wrong eventually — they were worried that that would be used by politicians to try to limit reproductive autonomy further,"" Karlin says.
That prediction has borne out. In 2022, the sister of Louisiana state Sen. Thomas Pressly was secretly drugged with abortion pills by her husband. Sen. Pressly then introduced a bill in Louisiana to make mifepristone and misoprostol ""controlled, banned substances."" The bill passed in 2024, making the drugs much harder to get, even for doctors. And possession of them without a prescription can result in jail time.

States have also sued
shield law providers
— doctors who prescribe abortion pills to states with abortion restrictions.
In May, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the FDA to review regulations on mifepristone, citing
a paper from a conservative think tank
that calls for restoring earlier restrictions on the drug and reconsidering the FDA's approval of mifepristone altogether. Medical experts have criticized the analysis in the paper, which hasn't been peer reviewed and reports higher serious adverse effects of the pill than was found in dozens of prior studies.
Despite these efforts to increase restrictions, NPR's reporting indicates that self-managed abortion, and the means to get support, is spreading in an informal, person-to-person way that might be outside government control. Sources shared stories of older sisters who had self-managed before helping their little sister through it, people getting pills and advice from their hairdresser, and several examples of people who had been supported by abortion doulas — someone who supports people through the process of self-managing — training to become doulas themselves.
Dee Redwine, an American who worked for 30 years in Latin America for Planned Parenthood Global, sees a pattern unfolding that she'd witnessed abroad. She learned about self-managed medication abortions in the 1990s and saw the use of misoprostol sweep across Latin America. She says when it comes to self-managed medication abortions in the U.S., ""There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.""
""That wave is coming. It's here. It's like crashing over the shores of the United States. It was… moved along much faster because of the
Dobbs
decision. And it is going to change entirely the landscape of abortion, just like it did globally,"" she says.
As Redwine sees it, the
Dobbs
decision matters for abortion access, but not in a straightforward way.

""The irony of this post-
Dobbs
world is that if it goes the way that I think it will, which is what I saw in Latin America, in some ways abortion ironically will become more accessible, but less legal.""

The waterborne infection is spread by parasitic worms and is found particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and health care.  It is contracted through contact with infected water in which women work (such as rice fields), bathe and do laundry. Considered by the United Nations as one of the most neglected of tropical diseases, it can result in infertility, ectopic pregnancy and genital ulcers. And because its symptoms — including vaginal itchiness and discharge, bloody urine and abdominal and pelvic pain — can resemble those of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), their onset can bring suspicion, shame and dishonor on those who contract them.
A
report by the U.N. agency UNAIDS
characterizes the disease as ""underdiagnosed, with grave implications for women's sexual and reproductive health."" It is also linked to a higher risk for contracting HIV from an infected partner.

AMMAN, Jordan — The King Hussein Cancer Center is huge and gleaming, with steel beams and floor-to-ceiling windows. Cozy cafes and stocked snack machines dot the air-conditioned lobby. It's a stark contrast to conditions in Gaza, from where dozens of its latest patients have come.
""We couldn't find food and wherever we went there were airstrikes,"" says Safa Salha, who spent months going from damaged hospital to damaged hospital, seeking treatment for her 16-year-old son Youssef.
Youssef, a tall, quiet teenager who lets his mother do most of the talking, was in 10th grade before the war between Israel and Hamas started in October 2023 and shut down all the schools.

Last year, he was operated on in Gaza for a brain tumor pressing down on his optic nerve. His mother says the hospital was unable to do MRI scans before the surgery and couldn't conduct a biopsy. Surgeons removed as much of the tumor as they could and sent him home two days later because they needed the bed, his mother says.
""The hardest thing was the decision to do the surgery,"" says Salha, a teacher and school activities organizer. ""You don't know if the doctors were going to be able to finish the surgery, you don't know if there's medicine available, you don't know if he was going to die during the surgery, or if we were going to die while he was there.""
Gaza health care in ruins
All of Gaza's hospitals have been either damaged or destroyed in Israeli airstrikes. Israel says it has targeted Hamas sites rather than civilian infrastructure.
In January, the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders
said Israeli attacks
had killed 1,000 health care workers
,
a figure Gaza's Health Ministry says has now grown to more than 1,400. Due to an Israeli blockade on food and medicine, hospitals that are partially opening do so with severe shortages of medicine, anesthesia and basic supplies.

""There have been difficulties imposed by the Israeli authorities that are stopping the way of making this happen smoothly,"" said Mohammad al-Momani, Jordan's government communication minister.
Jordanian officials say Israel, which controls the Gaza border, has obstructed exit visas needed for medical evacuations for some patients and guardians needed to travel with them. It's a long-standing issue:
Physicians for Human Rights

has taken the Israeli government to court
to try to force them to allow more patients out.
The Israeli military did not respond to NPR queries about obstructing exit visas. The United Nations' World Health Organization, which works with Israeli authorities and oversees logistics for medical evacuations, deferred comment to Israel.
Deadly delays
Health officials say delays in evacuations have meant diminished chances of survival for some of the sickest children, who elsewhere would receive immediate treatment.
""What we are seeing is really particular to Gaza patients — they are more advanced diseases,"" says the King Hussein Cancer Center chief of pediatrics Rawad Rihani. ""Cases where the tumor is very advanced with the lack of proper treatment and proper evaluation, or proper diagnosis, which makes them very hard to treat.""

""Some of them are very advanced and went to palliative care,"" Rihani says. ""Unfortunately we are not able to save everyone.""

Rihani says no cancer patients treated in Jordan since the start of the Gaza war have been sent back to Gaza. Jordan has been criticized though for sending people back during the continuing conflict it says have fully completed treatment for other illnesses.
""We are bringing them by batches,"" says Momani, the communications minister. ""We will take these children to treat them but then after they finish their treatment they should be going back to their homeland. We don't want to be in any way helping the displacement of Palestinians.""

Low-income children and families would be among the groups hit hardest by Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
While the bill would be a boon to wealthy Americans, it would scale back resources for the nation's poorest households, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned in a recent
letter
to lawmakers.
In an effort to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans in both the House and Senate want to change or reduce key social safety net programs that provide health care, food benefits and financial assistance for millions of children.
Here's what to know.
Sponsor Message
Health care for children
More than 37 million children
are enrolled
in either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal program that provides affordable health insurance to pregnant mothers and children who live just above Medicaid's poverty threshold.
Combined, Medicaid and CHIP protect
nearly half of all children
in the United States, beginning with important prenatal care, covering
over 40%
of U.S. births as well as nearly
half
of all rural births, and continuing to insure millions of vulnerable children into young adulthood.
Education
Students could get millions more in Medicaid health care dollars. Why aren't they?
Congressional Republicans want to continue to allow states to impose waiting periods before families can enroll in CHIP and to lock them out of the program if they fail to keep up with premiums.
They also propose changing Medicaid to include a first-ever
national work requirement
. As the House bill is written, it would exempt parents, ""but what we've seen from past experience with work requirements is that exemptions are not always effective,"" says Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Senate Republicans propose going even further, with a part-time work requirement including parents of children over 14.
""If [parents'] earnings go up because they're complying, that actually could be good for the kids,"" says Kevin Corinth, who studies poverty and safety net programs at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). ""Because there is good research showing that, when parents work and we get more earnings coming into the household, that can improve current and future outcomes [for children].""
Sponsor Message
In addition to work requirements, Republicans are proposing other changes that would create new administrative hurdles for families,
according to
Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families.
""When there's more red tape, we know that it's harder for families,"" says Joan Alker, head of the center and a Georgetown research professor.
""To see these kinds of cuts is very, very scary.""
House Speaker Mike Johnson's office defended the changes in a
press release
, writing that ""Republicans are protecting and strengthening Medicaid for American citizens who need and deserve it by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.""
He also claimed on
NBC's
Meet the Press
, ""there are no Medicaid cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. We're not cutting Medicaid.""
Policy-ish
Medicaid keeps getting more popular as Republicans aim to cut it by $800 billion
Yet CBO estimates the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly
$800 billion
over the next decade, and the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on improving health care access,
estimates 1 in 5 children
could be at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage if the House proposal goes into place.
Alker says the House changes would force states to make difficult decisions about whether to cut services or raise taxes.
""Governors are gonna have to do the dirty work,"" she says. And the Senate's proposal, she warns, would be even harder on states.
According to
research by CBO
, consistent Medicaid coverage in childhood increases earnings in adulthood, which increases tax revenue and can gradually repay the federal government for its early investment.
In fact,
CBO found
, ""increasing children's enrollment in Medicaid would reduce the future federal deficit by between roughly $800 and $3,400 per child per year of enrollment.""
Food assistance at home and at school
House Republicans have also proposed big changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, helps pay for groceries for
more than 15 million children
in the U.S.
Sponsor Message
This bill would bring ""the deepest cut to food assistance in history
,""
says
Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Shots - Health News
This mother relies on SNAP to help feed her kids. Now, she's bracing for cuts
The House bill would expand SNAP's existing work requirements, though Bergh says ""research has repeatedly shown that this doesn't increase people's employment. It doesn't increase their earnings. It just cuts people off of SNAP and leaves them hungry.
""
The House bill would also cut more than
$290 billion from SNAP
over 10 years – a cut Bergh estimates would ""eliminate or substantially reduce"" food assistance for more than 2 million children.
And the House proposal could, for the first time in the history of SNAP,
put states on the hook
for between 5% and 25% of the cost of food benefits.
Whether this shift in funding, from the federal government onto states, is a good idea is ""debatable,"" says AEI's Corinth, though he points to one potential upside: It could force states to have ""more skin in the game.
""
One potential downside,
according to CBO
, is that some states ""would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave [SNAP] altogether because of the increased costs.""
And for children, losing access to SNAP benefits could hurt them in more ways than one, as they would also lose their automatic enrollment in free meals at school.
In its analysis of the overall impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill,
CBO estimates
resources for the poorest households ""would decrease by about $1,600 per year,"" a loss ""mainly attributable"" to cuts in the social safety net, including Medicaid and SNAP.
By contrast, CBO predicts the wealthiest households would see an average annual gain of $12,000.
House Republicans hotly dispute CBO's math, with Speaker Mike Johnson
claiming
""the biggest beneficiaries of this [bill] will be low- and middle-income Americans.""
Senate Republicans'
proposal
mirrors the House proposal in many ways, including a work requirement and significant cost-shifting onto states.

Tax benefits for families
Senate Republicans are proposing updates that could improve and expand access to a handful of tax benefits that help families pay for child care, including the Child and Dependent Care tax credit.
""Expanding child care tax credits in the Senate bill is a step in the right direction toward making care more affordable and accessible for families nationwide,"" Sarah Rittling, executive director of First Five Years Fund, said in a statement. Her organization advocates for affordable access to quality child care and early learning.
Education
9 things to know about the big, private-school voucher plan in Republicans' tax bill
Researchers and child policy experts are less supportive of proposed changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).
The EITC is essentially an anti-poverty program in the form of a refundable tax credit that AEI's Kevin Corinth points out provides low-income, working families with extra help. Congressional Republicans are proposing additional administrative hurdles that families would have to overcome to qualify. Namely, requiring that
they go through an onerous precertification process
for their children before being able to claim the credit.
This additional step would be a burden not only on families but on the IRS, which has been the subject of
severe staff cuts
by the Trump administration.
Then there's the current Child Tax Credit, which can lower a family's tax bill by up to $2,000 per child. House Republicans want to increase that to $2,500. But households have to earn a certain amount of income to be eligible for the full credit.
Republicans are also ""making what is, in theory, a new higher credit much harder for families with children to actually receive,"" says Megan Curran, policy director with the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University.
Family
The expanded child tax credit briefly slashed child poverty. Here's what else it did
Current law requires children to be either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to be eligible for the CTC. The House bill could disqualify more than 4.5 million children,
Curran estimates
, because it would require both parents to have a Social Security number.
The
Senate bill would require
that only one parent have a Social Security number for their child to be eligible. It's unclear how many children that change would still disqualify.
The bill would also continue current policy, blocking the lowest-income families from qualifying for the full tax credit.
Sponsor Message
""Under current policy, a two-adult, two-child family needs at least $36,000 [in income] in order to get the full [credit],"" Curran says. ""That's 1 in 4 kids nationwide who are left out of the full credit.""
On the other hand, wealthy households earning up to $200,000 for individuals, or $400,000 for couples, can claim the full credit.
This disparity would get even more pronounced if the credit grows, Curran says, with that two-adult, two-child family now needing to earn $48,000 to claim the full credit.
""As a result, under the House Reconciliation Bill, 1 out of every
3
children would be left out of the full credit nationwide,"" Curran says.
Senate Republicans are pitching a smaller increase to the CTC, to $2,200, but the underlying machinery would similarly limit the benefit for the lowest-income households.
Many countries employ some kind of child benefit for families, but Curran says the U.S. is unusual in that ""we exclude the families with lower and moderate incomes. And those are children who arguably could really benefit from this type of investment the most.""
In 2021, Congress briefly increased and expanded the child tax credit to include the nation's lowest-income families. The expansion was short-lived — just six months — but research shows it helped cut the share of children living in poverty by
nearly half
.
Research shows investing in vulnerable children isn't just a benefit to them and their families, it also
provides lifetime
returns
to the nation
.
""Every dollar that you spend on the child tax credit in an expanded form that reaches all kids would return at least $10 a year,"" Curran says.
That's because children would be healthier, she says, and do better in school. Later, they would get better jobs and pay more back into the system, in the form of taxes."

For people new to family caregiving, the lack of resources and support often comes as a bitter surprise.
Many people caring for a sick or elderly relative are shocked to find out that Medicare does not cover the cost of a nursing home or subsidize care at home — the cleaning, driving, and helping with meals and dressing that so many families take on. Private health insurance doesn't pay either. The United States spends far less public money on long-term care than other wealthy nations.
Caregivers are on their own — and according to data from AARP, spend an average of $7,242 out of pocket each year. According to a recent Department of Labor report, they also miss out on an average of $43,500 in income due to the demands of adult care.

Caregiving can be a tough, lonely mission. One daughter found ways to reconnect
In the United States, caregiving is largely a private matter rather than a public concern. Americans caring for elderly or disabled adults cobble together help from nonprofits, community groups, church, friends and family — and even though there are 53 million of them,
often feel intensely alone.

The nation has long wrestled with how to think about care, says Durrance. In the last hundred years, we've seen both ambitious efforts to create nationwide public supports for care, and eras when caregiving was considered a purely private affair.
In the early 20th century, disabled and older people who needed help were relegated to almshouses, which were public institutions of last resort. Those homes were swamped by the wave of poverty during the Great Depression. In response, President Franklin Roosevelt and his team crafted the nation's first real safety net in an effort to keep people at home.

introduces Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, an architect of the unprecedented Social Security Act of 1935. That social insurance program ensured an income for older Americans, plus unemployment insurance and programs to help children, elders and blind people.
But domestic workers — including caregivers — were not eligible to pay into Social Security or receive its benefits. From this early date, the role was accorded this second-class status, as not quite a real job.
During the 1950s, rest homes and convalescent homes emerged, nurtured by a new federal policy that allowed old-age payments to go directly to private nursing homes. Between 1954 and 1965, nursing home beds doubled.
In the 1960s, the legislation creating Medicare intentionally declined to cover long-term care provided by family caregivers or in nursing homes. The rationale was that this care isn't technically medical. But even back then, legislators feared that the cost of covering long-term care would bankrupt the Medicare program, as law professor Sidney Watson recounts in her
review
of this history.
Medicaid, the sister program intended for low-income people, was designed to pay for long-term care. And it did — inadvertently nurturing a boom in nursing homes. In the two years after the bill passed in 1965, government payments to nursing homes skyrocketed by 600%. In the 1970s, stricter regulations around building codes and nursing staff favored large institutions, hospital-like settings and the first nursing home chains.
Frances Perkins is shown greeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943. Perkins was U.S. secretary of labor under Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945 and architect of the Social Security Act of 1935, which established federal support for elders, unemployed people, children and those who are blind.

These well-intentioned policies ""turned what could've felt like living in the community into living in the hospital,"" says Watson, an expert at health law at Saint Louis University School of Law. ""Once you've done that it's hard to unwind."" Indeed, even as late as 1988 just 10% of Medicaid's long-term care budget went to pay for care in the home.
That's basically where things still stand: Medicaid pays for 60% of the long-term stays in nursing homes, and there's precious little support for anyone who isn't eligible.

The film also considers the 1996 welfare reform laws from the perspective of care, and it explores the failures of the Affordable Care Act — which actually included a provision for a national program for subsidized long-term care insurance, quickly repealed as too expensive.
Viewers also meet the activists who are now trying to overcome that ambivalence and craft a new era of caregiving policy. There are signs that care is coming back into the public conversation: President Joe Biden initially promised more funds and policies aimed at caregivers in the Build Back Better Act, but the measures were ultimately stripped out.
In 2024, both presidential candidates proposed a tax credit for family caregivers; a bipartisan bill now in the House would establish a federal tax credit of $5,000 a year.
Durrance has seen these signs too. When the team announced the documentary project, he says, they were deluged by handwritten letters, emails and messages on LinkedIn, all from people who wanted to describe their own experiences and urge the filmmakers to act.
""I've been in this business a long time,"" he says. ""I've never experienced anything like this. It was a story crying out to be told.""

It's not the heat that gets you — it's the humidity.
Millions will feel that firsthand over the coming days as a heat dome is expected to bring extreme heat and humidity for much of the U.S.
Those humid conditions
will make temperatures feel even hotter
and pose health risks to many.
Why is that?
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Sheetal Rao, an internal medicine physician at UI Health — the academic health enterprise of the University of Illinois Chicago — with a focus on how the environment affects health, explained
that high levels of humidity simply make it feel hotter and challenge our body's mechanisms to regulate temperature.

Here's what she had to say about humidity and how to stay cool:
Why humidity poses risks during extreme heat
One of the human body's main ways of cooling down is sweating, and that sweat evaporating off the body. When it's humid, sometimes that isn't enough, Rao said.
""When the air is so full of moisture, that evaporation doesn't happen as efficiently or effectively, and so we aren't able to cool down as well,"" Rao said.
Rao said high humidity poses the strongest risk to seniors and young children, as well as pregnant women.

Planning to be outside on a hot and humid day? Take these precautions
But it can also come down to the exertion level of outdoor activity.
""So even a regular, healthy person who is out working very hard in the heat and humidity would be vulnerable,"" Rao said. ""And then, of course, people who are outdoors more for their job or people who are unhoused and then certain medications as well can make people more vulnerable.""
How can you stay safe during humid days?
While some people may initially feel that sitting by a fan alleviates the worst of the heat, Rao said that might not be enough on humid days. That's because the sweat on one's body doesn't have any place to evaporate off the skin because the air is already so full of water vapor.
Sponsor Message
""The fan kind of just cycles the same air around and it won't effectively cool people when it's very hot and humid,"" Rao added.
If you don't have air conditioning, Rao recommends getting some rest, taking regular breaks, closing blinds to cool down your home, hydrating and wearing loose-fitting clothes.

""But at some point when it gets very hot, air conditioning is likely the only intervention that's going to help you feel cool,"" Rao said. ""And so there are places that people can go to get cool, like cooling centers, but also just public buildings like libraries and malls and things like that.""

Handout/FreshRealm Inc./USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service
Some ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart are being voluntarily recalled following a nationwide listeria outbreak linked to 17 illnesses and three deaths as well as one fetal loss.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it is investigating the outbreak of
Listeria monocytogenes
, which they say has been traced to products made by FreshRealm, Inc. under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart.
""FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers,"" the agency said in a
statement
. ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.""

FreshRealm initiated a voluntary recall ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the company said in a statement, adding,  ""The company has not received any direct reports of illness associated with the product.""
""FreshRealm remains committed to the highest standards of food safety,"" the statement said.
The Food and Drug Administration
reports
that as of June 18, people in 13 states have reported becoming ill after eating precooked meals. ""Of the 17 cases under investigation, 16 were hospitalized and there are 3 deaths attributed to listeriosis. There is one pregnancy associated illness in a mother that resulted in a fetal loss,"" the FDA said.
According to the FSIS, the current strain was initially identified in sick people on dates ranging from August 2024-May 2025. That same outbreak strain was discovered in a FreshRealm facility during routine testing of its chicken fettuccine alfredo. The lot of meals including the tested sample was held, destroyed and never entered commerce.
Subsequent investigations at the facility did not uncover the source of the contamination and FSIS said it is still investigating whether a specific ingredient in the meals is the source of the outbreak.
In the meantime, they caution consumers to beware of the following products:
32.8-oz. tray packages containing ""MARKETSIDE GRILLED CHICKEN ALFREDO WITH FETTUCCINE Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken and Shaved Parmesan Cheese"" with best-by date 06/27/25 or prior.

The FSIS warns that consuming food contaminated with listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Sometimes those symptoms can be preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal issues. It is most dangerous in pregnant women, as the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. It can also cause fatal infections in older adults and people with weakened immune systems.

Stitching sutures is one way doctors treat wounds.
But now there's another kind of stitching to heal psychic wounds: tearing up and then sewing back together photographs of loved ones and homes. That's one of the rituals devised in the remote area of Alto Baudó in the western region of Colombia, where feuds between armed rebel and criminal groups have terrorized the population for years.
The photo stitching is part of a two-year project conceived of by Doctors Without Borders, working with community healers and midwives from 2022 to 2024. The goal has been to create rituals to help manage the anxiety, depression and other mental health risks posed by the area's widespread violence.
""I cure the 'evil eye,' the evil of the nation,"" says Margarita Rojas Mena, a healer and herbalist. ""When there are wounds, I use my herbs, and sometimes I've had to do sutures."" Here she is wearing a wreath composed of the leaves of the totumo plant, used traditionally to reduce pain from cramps and from childbirth.

The organization also brought in medical teams to
train 48 people in the community as health workers
and health promoters to ensure the availability of basic medical services. That's essential because the isolated location means that it may take two to three days to reach a health center or hospital.
As Santiago Valenzuela, a communication manager for Doctors Without Borders from Colombia, said, ""We created a dialogue between Western medicine and local healers.""
Traditional midwife Rogelina Arce Campo takes part in a newly created ritual to cope with the armed conflict in their part of Colombia. She tore an image of a place that has suffered from the violence, then used herbs and sutures to symbolically heal it.

About 14,000 people, many of them of African descent or indigenous Embera, live in the approximately 130 communities in this rainforest area bordered by the Baudò River, Pineda said. Thousands of people have fled the region to avoid confrontations between armed groups that sometimes forcibly try to recruit them. The use of land mines by the combatants poses a constant danger. As a result of these threats, many of those who remain confine themselves for safety, unable to work or attend school.

She has learned medical techniques as well. ""Many years ago, a physician from Doctors Without Borders taught me how to suture wounds,"" Mena says. ""Sometimes, I don't have the tools, like the needles and thread, so I have to use what I have: black thread and a well-disinfected sewing needle.

The first significant heat wave of the summer is hitting much of the United States this week. From the Midwest to the East Coast, extreme heat and humidity levels will significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses, according to the
National Weather Service
.
So if you're planning to be outside, whether it's for fun or for work, take measures to stay cool and protect yourself against heat-related illness, says

5 simple (and cheap) things to make your house use less energy
If there's a heat advisory in your area, you'll want to
avoid outdoor activities
. But even if there isn't one, take caution when outside on a hot day, she says. "" It's one of the big misconceptions about heat to think, 'I'm only in danger when there's a heat wave occurring.""
Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States, according to
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
, experts say its
risks are likely underestimated
.
It can cause heat exhaustion, ""your body's way of telling you to get out of the heat immediately,"" or heat stroke, a life-threatening illness
that can occur if heat exhaustion isn't treated, says
Dr. Renee Salas
, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected throughout the summer, according to NOAA. Heatwaves and longer, hotter summer seasons are intensifying because of
human-caused climate change
, according to the
World Health Organization
.
Here's how to plan for outings in hot weather.
Don't just rely on the air temperature. Check the heat index.
Before starting your lifeguard shift or going to that barbecue, take a moment to check the heat index. It includes humidity as well as the air temperature, giving you a more accurate read on how hot it will feel outside, Ward says.

Also take note of the cloud coverage, wind flow and time of day you plan to be outdoors. When it comes to heat-related illnesses, ""if it's a very humid day and there's no wind speed, then you are more at risk, even if the air temperature is lower,"" Ward says.
For example, a very humid 88-degree day with no wind could be more dangerous than a 94-degree day with low humidity.
If you can, plan outdoor activities earlier in the day, before the hottest time of day in your area. ""Three to 5 p.m. in the afternoon is one of the most dangerous times of day,"" says Ward.
Life Kit
Cheap and easy ways to stock your emergency go bag
Consider what you're wearing.
Whether you're headed to the pool or going for a walk, wear lightweight, breathable garments. Opt for cotton or linen fabrics, which have big pores in their woven threads that allow for air circulation, or moisture-wicking materials, which draw sweat away from your skin, helping it to evaporate more quickly, Ward says.
Choose loose-fitting silhouettes, Salas says. If your clothes are too tight, the sweat on your skin can't evaporate, which is key to keeping your body cool. ""I'm sure people don't love sweating profusely, but sweating is actually our friend when it comes to heat.""
Don't forget sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat to prevent sunburn, says
Alyssa Provencio
, a professor at the University of Central Oklahoma who researches emergency and disaster management.
Opt for shady, natural environments.
Your location can make a big difference in how hot it feels. Dark surfaces like asphalt tend to absorb more heat than natural environments. And because shaded areas have less solar exposure, they can feel much cooler, Ward says. ""You can reduce the temperature around you 10 degrees or more by just moving to an area that's shaded.""
So if you're a dog walker and it's a hot day, walk those pets down a tree-lined park or a wooded trail instead of the sidewalk. Or if you're headed to the pool, bring a sun umbrella or a pop-up tent to provide some coverage, Provencio says.
Sponsor Message
Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion.
If you're out with a group of friends on a hot day, keep yourself and others safe by looking out for signs of illness among each other. ""Somebody may notice something in you that you don't notice,"" Salas says.
Heat exhaustion is
your body's warning sign that you're starting to overheat, Salas says. Generally, symptoms include sweating more than
usual, weakness, dizziness, fainting, pale skin
,
nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
Pay special attention to seniors, children, people with certain pre-existing medical conditions, and people on commonly prescribed medications to help manage blood pressure and mental health conditions. They are at higher risk of heat-related illnesses, Salas says.
If you or someone you know is experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, Salas recommends going into an air-conditioned room. Provencio recommends public libraries because they're free and open to everyone.
If you're still experiencing symptoms of heat exhaustion after removing yourself from the heat, seek medical care.
Water is your friend.
On hot days, bring water with you wherever you go. Salas says drinking water can help your body produce more sweat.
Beware of drinking alcohol on hot days, she says. You may be tempted to crack open a cold beer on the beach, but it's a diuretic that can dehydrate you and impact your ability to sweat and cool yourself.

If you're feeling hot and need a quick way to cool down, you can also submerge yourself in a body of water. If that's not feasible, dunk your feet and arms in cold water, Ward says. It can ""lower your core body temperature.""
Lower your body temperature with cooling towels.
If you're feeling hot, put an ice pack, a wet towel or a cooling towel,
which stays extra cold when they get wet
, on the back of your neck, under your armpits and on your groin, Ward says.

""Some of the body's major blood vessels closer to the skin live there,"" Salas says. And when you put something cold on those areas, ""it can help cool the blood running through them.""
Don't forget to take breaks.
""If you're being active outside, whether that's working, exercising or
playing sports, as you work, your muscles are producing heat,"" Salas says. So take a moment to stop producing heat and cool down in the shade or an air-conditioned room.
On those breaks, remember to drink more water too, Provencio says.

A new study finds that addiction to social media, mobile phones and video games is linked to a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
The study, published in JAMA
on Wednesday, looked at data on more than 4,000 kids from an ongoing longitudinal study following them for years, starting at ages 9 to 10. It found that by age 14, about a third of the kids had become increasingly addicted to social media, about a quarter had become increasingly addicted to their mobile phone and more than 40% showed signs of addiction to video games.

""And these youth are significantly more likely to report suicidal behaviors and thoughts,"" says study author

We're not 'out of the woods' in the youth mental health crisis, a CDC researcher says
""It's an important study and raising awareness about screen addiction,"" says
Dr. Jason Nagata
, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent screen use at the University of California, San Francisco. ""It shows that elements of addiction related to screen use are more strongly predictive of poorer mental health and even suicide risk compared to just screen time. So, I think that it provides more nuance.""
A large study known as ABCD
Xiao and her colleagues used data from a large-scale ongoing longitudinal study called the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study
. It's been following thousands of kids over the years, and assessing them periodically for both their average daily screen time as well as for symptoms of addiction, which also allowed them to see how these addictive behaviors changed over time.
They assessed addiction with a standardized questionnaire asking them to respond to statements like, ""'I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning to use the social media apps,'"" explains Xiao. ""'I try to use the social media app less, but I can't.' And also 'I feel stressed and or upset if I am not allowed to use my social media apps' or 'I use it so much already it has a bad effect on my schoolwork.'""
Sponsor Message
Her team was able to group the teens based on how these answers changed over time.
With social media, they found that almost 60% had low levels of addiction to social media and that stayed stable over the years. But about a tenth had increasing addiction that peaked around year three and four of the study, and a third showed increasing addiction.
With mobile phone use, about half showed high addiction and a quarter had increasing addiction. With video games, they found only two groups — with about 60% showing low addiction that stayed stable over time, and 41% were highly addicted to it through the period.
Questions about suicidal behavior
The study also evaluated suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It uses a questionnaire that asked about passive and active thoughts of suicide, as well as any suicide attempts. At year four of the study, nearly 18% reported having had suicidal thoughts, and 5% admitted to suicidal behaviors, which includes making suicide plans and attempts.
The groups with high and increasing addiction to mobile phone and social media were associated with a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The highly addictive group for video games also had a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to the group with low addictive use. However, total screen time was not linked to a higher suicide risk.
""What surprised us is that these are substantial groups, and they are associated with 2 to 3 times [risk] of suicidal behaviors,"" says Xiao.
Screen time is not inherently good or bad
Researchers, educators, and parents often point to the amount of time teens spend on their screens to gauge problematic use, say Xiao and Nagata.
""We all get reports from our phones about our weekly screen time,"" says Nagata. ""Screen time is an easily understandable metric because it's minutes or hours a day that we're spending on screens.""

But, he adds, screen time isn't inherently good or bad, so he welcomes the nuance this study adds to the conversation since it flags signs of addiction.

Here are 4 ways parents can help their teens be smart with screen time
""Some kids might spend their time on screen reading the news, and some might be trolling some pretty dangerous sites,"" says psychologist
Mitch Prinstein
, a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""So it's really hard to know what to make of screen time as a risk factor.""
That's why screen time alone is ""not a helpful measure,"" says psychologist Mary Alvord. It's more important to understand how a teen is using their screen time.
""They may be talking to a friend, but are they talking to a friend I-R-L, or are they talking to an avatar created by AI?"" says Alvord. ""And are they using screens to avoid things in real life?""
Avoidance of real life is a red flag
One of the statements in the addictive use questionnaire is: ""I play video games so I can forget about my problems.""
""Avoidance is a key symptom of both anxiety and depression,"" says Alvord, and it is revelatory about a teen's mental health status and relationship with video games or screens in general.
""We're starting to really try and understand what are the specific features or the specific behaviors that might be more concerning,"" explains Prinstein, who has co-chaired the American Psychological Association's
advisory panel on social media use in adolescents
. ""And the extent to which kids say, 'I can't stop even when I'm trying to. I'm having withdrawal, dependence, tolerance symptoms,' that's important.""
Nagata has also used data from the ABCD study
to understand how teens are using social media
over time and how that's affecting their risk of mental health symptoms.
""One thing that was really striking to me is that, unfortunately, these symptoms of screen addictions are actually pretty common,"" says Nagata. He also found that some of the symptoms get more common over time.

He and his colleagues found that 47.5% of 11-12 year olds said that ""I lose track of how much I am using my phone,"" 22.5% said ""I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning my use of social media apps"" and 18.4% said ""I use social media apps so I can forget about my problems.""

The truth about teens, social media and the mental health crisis
By age 12-13,
25% said they use social media to forget about their problems
, and 25% admitted to spending a considerable amount of time thinking about social media apps.
Using the same data from the ABCD study, he and his colleagues also found that time on social media increased for preteens over the course of the study. ""At the beginning of the study, the average time was only 7 minutes a day, but four years later, the average time was over 70 minutes a day.""
And
the more time these kids spent on social media
, the more their depressive symptoms increased.
""Parents, teachers, clinicians should be, on the lookout for warning signs for screen addictions, particularly as they may relate to higher depression risk or suicide risk in teenagers,"" Nagata says."

He notes that SAMHSA's announcement omitted the ""T"" for transgender and ""Q"" for queer which are typically included in the acronym LGBTQ+.
Cutting off support for this group of youth, he says, sends a message ""and that message is more like you're on your own.""
He says, there were clues that something like this might happen — the service wasn't in the president's budget for next year, for instance. But he says it's destabilizing ""because it's a system that has been set out over the last couple of years that people are beginning to finally utilize and rely on.""
""As someone who has worked in this space for over two decades, I just don't understand the strategy,"" he adds.
HHS did not respond by deadline to NPR's request for an on-the-record comment on this story.
Miller says the data are clear that there is a need for support for the specialized service.
This January and February, he says, the LGBTQ+ service fielded about 100,000 contacts, ""which means that there are a lot of people who identify as LGBTQ+ who are seeking help through this line.""
""What they get with that specialized services line is they get somebody who cares, somebody who's been there with them, who has shared experiences, who can understand where they're coming from, and who has been specially trained to address the situations that they are dealing with,"" says
Hannah Wesolowski
, the chief advocacy officer at the non-profit
National Alliance for Mental Illness
.
""And we know that crisis services geared towards LGBTQ+ youth and young adults work,"" says Wesolowski. ""These services save lives.""
Taking that service away from 988 could be devastating for individuals, say Wesolowski and other mental health advocates.

A drug with the potential to drastically curb the HIV epidemic just cleared its first regulatory hurdle.
On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV. Clinical trial data from last year suggest just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against an HIV infection.
""It's a milestone moment in the history of HIV,"" says Daniel O'Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, which manufactures the drug, which was already approved to treat HIV infection. ""In our opinion, it's the best tool yet in helping end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere."" Others agree. In 2024,
Science
hailed lenacapavir as its ""
Breakthrough of the Year
"" in 2024.

The twice-yearly injection offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care for HIV prevention, a daily pill called Truvada. This pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is 99% effective at preventing HIV infection in clinical trials, but some people face significant barriers in taking a daily pill. One study found oral PrEP's was only
26% effective
in certain groups, in part because of skipped doses.
""Even though the pills work, the Achilles heel of that strategy is that people were not adhering to taking the pills as prescribed,"" says
Onyema Ogbuagu
, an infectious disease researcher at Yale University.
A twice-a-year treatment could reach substantially more people, especially those who face stigma for taking a daily medication. For instance, researchers found that some single women in South Africa say taking a daily pill
raises suspicion
among their partners.
But the cost of the drug — roughly $28,000 a year — could price out many. While Gilead is taking steps to broaden access, the high price coupled with the U.S.'s steep cuts to foreign aid could prevent people in countries with the highest HIV burden from benefiting.
""Breakthrough of the year""
Existing PrEP pills block an enzyme that the HIV virus uses to copy its genetic material and reproduce. Lenacapavir works a bit differently, targeting the virus's ""capsid protein,"" which houses its genetic material.
Sponsor Message
Lenacapavir's power to prevent infection lies in its ability to disrupt this capsid, which prevents the virus from replicating for about six months. That
power was demonstrated
in two clinical trials, called PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2, which were published last year in peer-reviewed journals.
PURPOSE 1 tracked over 5,000 cisgender women in South Africa and Uganda starting in 2021. Not a single woman who received lenacapavir contracted HIV over the
course of the trial
.
PURPOSE 2
tracked more than 3,200 cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non-binary persons, finding HIV infections in just 2 of the participants who received lenacapavir, an efficacy of 96%.
""The efficacy for lenacapavir is just ridiculously high,"" says Ogbuagu, who was involved in PURPOSE 2. ""These are just like, unheard of numbers.
Uncertain access
The FDA's decision makes lenacapavir available today in the U.S., which sees about 31,000 of the 1.3 million new HIV infections each year worldwide.
While the FDA's decision has no bearing on access in other countries, it does build momentum for other regulatory authorities to approve the drug, says
Carmen Pérez Casas
, senior strategy lead at Unitaid, a United Nations agency that helps reduce the cost of treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. European Union approval will be especially important in enabling approval in low- to middle-income countries, she says, and could happen later this year.
""But approval from a regulatory authority of a country doesn't imply that we see access to this product yet,"" says Pérez Casas. Ultimately, that will depend on cost and distribution mechanisms, especially in low and middle-income countries.
""For the moment, countries are paying approximately $40 per person per year for oral PrEP,"" she says. ""Anything that diverges drastically from that level of price will really impose a big stress on budget lines on HIV.""
In principle, lenacapavir could be manufactured for even less than that, according to Andrew Hill, a pharmacology researcher at Liverpool University. He and his colleagues calculated that the drug could be mass produced for just $25 for the two biannual doses, based on the current manufacturing costs. ""That includes a 30% profit margin,"" he says.
Sponsor Message
Gilead's list price of $28,000 a year is far, far above that. ""We have made a decision to price in line with the existing PrEP options,"" says O'Day, the company's CEO, but Gilead is working on several levels to provide lower-cost alternatives.
Gilead signed royalty-free licensing agreements with six generic manufactures last year, whom they'll work with to provide lower-cost versions of lenacapavir to 120 lower-income countries with a high incidence of HIV. Several high-incidence but relatively higher-income countries like Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, are left out of that deal and could face higher costs, though the company says they're working with such countries directly on tiered pricing.
Until those generic manufacturers get up and running, the company says it will provide up to 2 million people in these countries with lenacapavir at cost, with no profit going to Gilead.
""That looks like a lot of drug, but if there are 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, and you need to treat between 40-50 people with a preventative drug to prevent one infection, then 2 million is not going to do anything,"" says Hill. ""It's not large enough to have any significant effect on the epidemic.""
If other countries follow the FDA's lead, lenacapavir could become increasingly available in the coming months and years. But the Trump administration's drastic cuts to foreign aid — including HIV prevention — could limit lenacapavir's ultimate reach.
""It's a very difficult situation,"" says Hill. ""Because of the cuts in funding, we're going to see millions of people die from HIV in the next several years."""

It was a surreal moment for Susanne Brander.
She was sitting in the audience at a conference in April as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke about the health effects of exposure to harmful chemicals in our food, air and water.
As she listened, Kennedy cited recent research on microplastics from researchers in Oregon, finding these tiny particles had shown up in 99% of the seafood they sampled.
""It was definitely our study,"" says
Brander
, an ecotoxicologist at Oregon State University who co-authored the
research
along with a team at Portland State University.
The problem was, just an hour earlier while in line for breakfast, an email had popped into her inbox notifying her that a federal grant she'd relied on to fund her research for years — from the Environmental Protection Agency — was being terminated.

Her research, the letter explained, no longer aligned with the agency's priorities. And now here was the standard-bearer of the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, agenda elevating her work.
""I was baffled and incredibly frustrated,"" she recalls. ""It feels like they are promoting the field while ripping out the foundation.""
Kennedy and the MAHA movement's rise to power is disorienting for scientists and advocates in environmental health who are focused on human exposure to toxic chemicals and environmental pollutants.

The National Institutes of Health, which is under Kennedy's command, has
stopped accepting submissions

Regulations on hold
At the EPA, which would play a critical role in any substantive efforts to reduce harmful chemicals and pollution, the agency's administrator Zeldin is
prioritizing deregulation
and
cutting staff
.
The agency has
delayed implementing
national drinking water standards on PFAS, or ""forever chemicals,"" and
proposed lifting regulations
to reduce emissions of mercury and toxic pollutants from power plants. It has pushed
back the deadline
for industry to submit safety studies on more than a dozen chemicals including benzene, vinyl chloride and Bisphenol A.
The administration appointed a scientist who spent years working for the American Chemistry Council, Nancy Beck, to a prominent role at the EPA, despite the MAHA report's emphasis on eliminating conflicts of interest.
Zeldin
has even touted
EPA's success in gutting research grants. The cuts have affected scientists who are trying to understand the toxic effects of chemicals, including a researcher at Wayne State University, Christopher Kassotis, whose
work on chemical mixtures
was cited in the MAHA commission report.
Rebecca Fry

""Their focus is exactly what's in MAHA,"" she says. ""They're trying to understand these complex associations between chemicals in the environment and human health and disease.""
And Zota worries about the loss of grants around the country to train scientists on the toxic effects of environmental chemicals. ""It's just so devastating,"" she says. ""If you talk about how to kill a field, you really attack the up-and-coming generation.""
The EPA said in a statement to NPR that the administration is ""working to solve big problems and having robust conversations across government about how to drive economic growth while protecting human health and the environment as part of the Make America Healthy Again Commission.""

A growing concern among scientists
As Kennedy's MAHA push brings new visibility to her field,
Tracey Woodruff
, who leads the UCSF Center on Reproductive Health and the Environment, says she and many of her colleagues are trying to navigate a delicate exercise in science communication.
Sponsor Message
Kennedy
has a history
of making false or misleading claims on this topic, whether it's about
chemtrails
, or the effect of
certain herbicides
on gender. His rhetoric about the ""mass poisoning of children"" can veer into sweeping claims about the impacts of environmental toxins, without sufficient scientific evidence. And his actions on vaccines have
provoked alarm
across public health.
More broadly, MAHA's focus on environmental toxins sometimes reflects a
strain of thought
in the world of alternative medicine and wellness that inaccurately frames any ""natural"" substance as good and man-made or synthetic chemicals as bad.
But it's also true that when it comes to many well-studied chemicals, including some that Kennedy cites, ""we have enough data to take action,"" she says. ""If we don't talk about the things that he's saying that are real issues the government should be addressing, I'm worried it will delegitimize all our work.""
Woodruff and others in her field have outlined their major areas of concern in
consensus statements
and
other
peer-reviewed
papers
on the
evidence
tying synthetic chemicals and other substances to obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, neurodevelopmental disorders and more.
Phthalates, forever chemicals, flame retardants, bisphenols, formaldehyde-releasing preservatives and certain pesticides are some of the culprits, but there are thousands in use that have never been carefully evaluated for their health effects, especially on infants and children.
""There are huge gaps in the way that we regulate or protect people from these harms,"" says Burke of Johns Hopkins.
It's enormously challenging to pinpoint the impact of specific substances because people encounter so many of them over the course of their lives. The evidence of harm often comes from lab work and long-running observational studies that can look for relationships with disease and health problems in the population.
Increasingly, researchers emphasize it's the cumulative exposure that is most concerning here.

chemicals
in everyday
products

Linda Birnbaum, the now-retired director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, was also in the audience with Susanne Brander when Kennedy spoke at the
policy summit on chemicals
and plastics earlier this year.
She says about ""80% to 90%"" of what she heard during that speech was ""really good"" about the need for major reform. ""But there are no simple solutions. We're not going to cure chronic disease in a year or three years or five years,"" she says.
Questions about a bold agenda
In public appearances, Kennedy has outlined what experts describe as an ambitious agenda to overhaul how the U.S. evaluates chemicals, particularly in the realm of food and some consumer products.
""It would do what many of us have been asking for for a long time,"" says Trasande at NYU. ""I'm not trying to put rose-colored glasses on. I just think we have to call it fairly,"" he adds.
This includes looking at the cumulative and mixture effects of chemicals in the food supply and revising a regulatory pathway that allows companies to self-declare whether a food additive is safe.
In a statement to NPR, HHS also pointed to
its announcement
of a new review program to ""reassess previously approved chemicals in food and food-contact material and expand safety assessments to study endocrine and neurobehavioral effects."" According to the FDA,
a public website
will share information about chemicals under review.
But academics and advocacy groups that have pushed for such changes are skeptical about the Trump administration's commitment.
Even on
eliminating petroleum-based
food dyes, an area that Kennedy has touted as a major achievement, Woodruff points out that the administration made this a voluntary decision for manufacturers, not an outright ban.

Katherine O'Brien

She and other advocates say there's a lot the Trump administration
could
do quickly — actions like prohibiting phthalates in food packaging, which
groups like hers
have wanted the FDA to do for years.
And the reality is that any comprehensive effort to crack down on harmful chemicals requires the EPA to also wield its regulatory powers because the substances also show up in our water and the environment.
Maria Doa
, a former EPA scientist now at the Environmental Defense Fund, says this is a glaring inconsistency in the Trump administration's MAHA platform.
""You need to take a holistic approach,"" she says. ""You shouldn't be pulling back efforts to regulate our exposure to chemicals in one area and say you're going to be more protective in another.""
As a self-described pragmatist, Linda Birnbaum says she hopes to salvage something from the ""mess"" that has disrupted so much of her field, but mostly she's dubious.
""Very honestly, my concern with Kennedy, among others, is that as soon as he starts actually trying to regulate some of this stuff, industry is going to go to Trump and they'll kick him out,"" she says."

For the first time in more than a year, street drug deaths appear to be rising across the U.S. according to
a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
.
The latest available data, compiled in January of this year, shows fatal overdoses over the previous 12-month period
increased by roughly 1,400 deaths.
""This slight increase reflects historic data and suggests that the U.S. saw more overdose deaths in January 2025 than it did in January 2024,"" the CDC said in a statement sent to NPR.  ""We are working on analyses to better understand geographic trends.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC data suggests roughly 82,138 deaths during the 12-month period ending in January 2025. That would be a significant increase from the December 2024 report, but it's still far below the overdose crisis peak of 114,664 recorded in August 2023.
Still, after seventeen months of declines in fatal overdoses that stunned drug policy experts and an
unprecedented 27 percent drop in drug deaths in 2024
, some addiction researchers described this report as troubling.
Health
U.S. overdose deaths continue a rapid decline
Keith Humphreys, a researcher at Stanford University, said the new CDC data could be an early warning that drug death declines brought on by a number of factors, including the end of COVID pandemic disruptions and weaker fentanyl being sold on U.S. streets, could be fading.
""If we assume it's not a blip, this makes it more likely that the sudden drop [in fatal overdoses] was a one-off event rather than a fundamental change in epidemic dynamics,"" Humphreys said in an email.
Most overdose deaths in the U.S. are caused by fentanyl, but researchers who sample the street drug supply have warned of an increasingly dangerous mix of chemicals being sold by dealers, including cocaine and methamphetamines, as well veterinary tranquilizers such as medetomidine and xylazine.
""Overdose trends are not a one-way street, and there will be periodic local increases,"" said Nabarun Dasgupta, who studies overdose trends at the University of North Carolina.
Sponsor Message
His analysis of the latest CDC data suggested ""most of the country is still trending down in the right direction.""
According to Dasgupta, the ""increase in predicted national numbers are driven primarily by upticks in Texas, Arizona, California and Washington.""
A ""blip"" or a troubling new trend?
Drug death data in the U.S. is collected slowly and made public only after significant delays.
Experts say reports like this one, incorporating the most recent available preliminary data from January, offer only a crude snapshot of the current street drug situation.
CDC officials said ""fluctuations"" in drug overdose deaths could be caused by a number of factors including changes in the illegal drug supply and shifts in access to treatment.
This CDC data is
from the period before President Trump took office or any of his policies took effect.
But the apparent rise in drug deaths comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are moving to curtail spending on addiction-related public health and science programs, as well as funding for Medicaid, which currently provides the largest source of insurance coverage for people in the U.S. experiencing addiction.
""America is still in the middle of an incredibly deadly addiction and overdose crisis,"" Dr. Stephen Taylor, head of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said in response to the latest CDC data.
""Reducing federal support for Medicaid — the largest payer of mental health and substance use disorder treatment — would be a sign of retreat,"" Taylor added.
Regina LaBelle, former White House acting chief of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Joe Biden, who studies addiction policy at Georgetown University, echoed that concern but said she hopes this report amounts to a ""blip"" in what had been steady improvements in drug death numbers.
""I do know that there's always more we can do in a bipartisan way to curb overdose deaths. Cutting grants to states and laying off thousands of employees isn't a plan,"" she said.

In a statement to NPR on Tuesday, CDC officials said this latest data highlights the need for continued ""public health investments"" to research and monitor street drug impacts."

Uganda is among the 36 countries under consideration for future restrictions. If that happens, Karan worries his team may have restricted access to that expertise. While such restrictions wouldn't preclude collaboration via Zoom, Karan says it's just not the same as in-person.
""Many of the best conversations and ideas that we had happened during our drives, during meals or unplanned moments,"" he says of interactions with foreign researchers in person.
""Implementing these kinds of bans has a huge effect on research studies and really impedes progress.""

Scientific conferences often serve as the nexus for that kind of collaboration, where researchers gather to share research and connect with colleagues. Trump's travel restrictions are already preventing some scientists from being able to travel to the U.S. for conferences.
""We need to have such participation and contact, but it's now very difficult,"" said a biomedical scientist from Yemen who requested anonymity because speaking out could draw negative attention that would cause her university to retaliate. The scientist was planning to travel to California this fall for a conference on cancer management but cannot because of the ban, noting:. ""Such an absolute restriction for all people is not wise.""
The U.S. could also lose its global role as a key location for trainings and scientific conferences. The travel bans, coupled with broader tensions around immigration in the U.S., have already led organizers of these events to
look elsewhere.
""Our research team decided to host a planning meeting in London as opposed to the U.S. due to concerns with visas and the overall climate,"" says Walson. There are economic consequences if U.S. conferences are canceled, he says. And with a likely reduced U.S. presence at conferences held elsewhere, there could be more intangible impacts too.
""Diseases don't respect borders, and infections travel faster than diplomacy,"" says Walson. ""Whether we want to or not, we have to understand the reality of the global community as it is today. If we don't engage, we will suffer the consequences."""

A former chess coach found out the hard way about the Taliban enforcing its ban on chess.
Ahmad Sami Hassanzadeh
, 44, was in a park, playing chess in the western city of Herat with friends when they were accosted by members of the Taliban vice squad. ""They shouted at us, they grabbed our chess sets and pieces and they beat up two of my friends,"" he recalled. One of his friends tried to challenge the men, who work for the ministry for the prevention of vice and promotion of virtue, which upholds the Taliban's hardline interpretation of Islam, as fleshed out in its recent morality laws. He says one of them told him: ""Playing chess is forbidden. Buying a chess set is forbidden. Even watching it — is forbidden.""
Sponsor Message
""In short,"" Hassanzadeh said in a telephone interview, ""this healthy and harmless entertainment was snatched away from us.""
The Taliban's ban on playing chess in public was reported in May by local and international media, but it appeared that it had begun long before, implemented in stops and starts. Hassanzadeh told NPR that after the Taliban seized power in August 2021, the local chapter of the Afghan chess federation held a competition in his hometown of Herat. After that, he says, he was told the federation wouldn't be allowed to hold any more games. But chess players were still allowed to play the game informally — in the parks, ""like you do around the world.""
But weeks before the ban was officially announced, Hassanzadeh said customs officials intercepted chess books and games he was importing from neighboring Iran and Pakistan. And then, he said, the national chess federation was officially suspended — he'd  led the Herat chapter up until 2017. One woman told NPR that the suspension on women playing chess outside their homes began even earlier — after the Taliban came to power four years ago. That's when she and her friends were barred from their local chess club, which had a designated room for women to play chess.

The woman asked to remain anonymous because she was being critical of the Taliban and feared retribution.
She told NPR that she'd been a professional chess player for years — her father taught her the game as a child. Before the Taliban came to power, she used to run classes for women and girls. ""Not only did the local community, families and schools not forbid us,"" she recalled, ""we were actually encouraged.""
""All that has changed,"" she said. ""We still practice at home and online,"" she told NPR, ""but it's not like playing in the open. I can't deny it — women feel frustrated.""
Girls play in a 2021 chess competition in Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of the northern Balkh province, Afghanistan. Girls and women had been encouraged to learn the game — until the Taliban took power and ordered a suspension of women playing chess outside their homes — a precursor to the 2025 ban on the game.

Chess in Afghanistan isn't madly followed like cricket or the national game —
buzkashi
— a polo-like sport, except the jockeys have whips and they have to dash across a field holding the carcass of a goat or a
substitute
to win.
But chess players said the game has long been played here — except when the Taliban first came to power in 1996 — and banned chess, for the first time, said John Butt, an Islamic scholar who lived in Afghanistan during that time.
That chess ban ended in 2001 after the U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban in the wake of the deadly, militant attacks of 9/11, Butt said.
The Taliban suspended chess — during its first iteration of rule, and now, because it's ""a means of gambling,"" the sports minister Atal Mashwani told the
French news service, AFP
. ""There are religious considerations regarding the sport of chess,"" he added, without elaborating what those considerations were. He added: ""Until these considerations are addressed, the sport of chess is suspended in Afghanistan.""

But the president of the now disbanded Afghanistan Chess Federation says he believes the suspension is permanent. ""The Taliban, when they decide, are firm in their decision,"" said Ghulam Ali Malikzad, who spoke from Germany, where he sought asylum after the Taliban seized power. ""There is no hope that it will be reopened.""

Because of .... gambling?
The claim that chess is a form of gambling was baffling, according to every chess player NPR spoke to, including Herat resident Jarallah Badghisi. ""There's no gambling or betting in the official games,"" he said, referring to the ones that used to take place under the auspices of the chess federation. And ""even people who play in the parks — it's a hobby.""
Nigel Short
, director of chess development at the
international chess federation
, says they're moving carefully to try to repeal the chess ban. He told NPR that he hopes the Taliban will see that their suspension makes them ""an outlier. We have so many federations from countries that are Muslim — dozens and dozens.""
But the idea of chess as a sleazy game of chance isn't new, said Butt, the Islamic scholar. It goes back to the first days of Islam. ""There was this perception at the time of the holy prophet that this was a type of gambling,"" Butt said, referring to the prophet Mohammad. He says one revered early Muslim even said, ""only a sinner plays chess.""
There was pushback that began around the eighth and ninth century. That's when one of Islam's greatest scholars, known as
al-Shafi'i
weighed in. According to Sir Raymond Keene, an international chess grandmaster and writer, al-Shafi'i said that ""chess was practice for warfare, for military maneuvers, and should therefore be permitted under Islamic law and that was the view that generally prevailed"" and added conditions of playing chess, which included not gambling on the game or letting it distract a player from prayers.
Keene says that during al-Shafi's time, elites of one Islam's greatest empires, the Abbasids of Baghdad, played lots of chess. ""Certainly during the Baghdad period,"" he said, ""
the greatest chess players
in the world were all Islamic players, people like al-Suli and
al-Lajlaj.
These guys were fantastically good,"" he said — and ultimately spread the game to Europe.

Not the first chess ban
The Taliban aren't the only ones who have banned chess. Following the Iranian revolution, the religious authorities who assumed power banned chess over gambling concerns. It was repealed nearly a decade later on condition that players wouldn't gamble on the outcome. Now the country is a regional center for chess.
But Iran — which neighbors Afghanistan — has been at the heart of other chess-related controversies. Over the past eight years, at least four women chess players and a referee participated in a tournament in another country and were observed not wearing headscarves (which is mandatory in Iran). Fearing punishment, they decided not to return home.
They include
Dorsa Derakhshani
, who now lives in the U.S.
She told NPR that the Taliban's chess suspension didn't surprise her. ""Classic dictator 101 move,"" she quipped. ""Chess helps you think critically,"" she said. ""If there's a dictatorship, they don't want thinkers.""
Her message to Afghan chess players, she said, is that she hopes ""you might get the opportunity to leave and get to represent another country.""
Hassanzadeh, the former chess coach, says he dreams of leaving if the suspension isn't rescinded. ""We've grown up with chess, it's woven into our veins,"" he said. ""Banning chess is like cutting out a piece of my heart."""

Medicaid has always been pretty popular, which is why the latest numbers on it even surprised pollster
Ashley Kirzinger
.
""We actually are seeing a pretty significant uptick in Medicaid popularity,"" says Kirzinger, who is director of survey methodology for health research organization KFF. According to a
poll published Tuesday
, 83% of the public have favorable views of Medicaid. Just a few months ago, in January, that figure was 77% of the public.
Support from 3 in 4 Republican voters
""The largest uptick we saw in favorability of the past couple of months was among Republicans,"" Kirzinger adds. Three in 4 Republicans now say they view Medicaid favorably.
Sponsor Message
That popularity boost comes as many more people are hearing about Republican cuts to Medicaid in the news. It's among the most difficult political issues for Republican lawmakers trying to navigate narrow majorities in both houses of Congress to pass their tax and budget bill. The legislation, officially named the
""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,""
passed the House, and the Senate is trying to pass its version before the July 4 recess.
That budget bill is much less popular than Medicaid, the KFF poll found. Overall, 2 in 3 Americans have unfavorable views of the bill. Those who support President Trump do like the bill, but they also like Medicaid, Kirzinger says.
Support for more Medicaid funding
Medicaid provides health coverage to
71 million
low-income and disabled people across the country. (Since Medicaid goes by many different names, such as KanCare in Kansas and Apple Health in Washington State, pollsters ask their Medicaid questions using the name of the program in the home state of the interviewee, Kirzinger explains.) An additional 7 million low-income children are enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.
Part of the popularity of Medicaid is its reach. ""A large share of the public say that either they or a family member have ever received some type of coverage through Medicaid,"" Kirzinger says. ""Once people are thinking about Medicaid as a program that has benefited themselves or a family member, then it hits a little bit closer to home for them.""
Sponsor Message
In fact, ""people want to see increased spending on Medicaid and they don't want to see it cut,"" she says. In March,
KFF found
only 17% of people were in favor of decreased federal funding for Medicaid, and 42% said it should actually be increased.
Medicaid is funded by a combination of state and federal tax dollars. The current budget bill being hammered out in the Senate cuts
nearly $800 billion
in federal spending on Medicaid to help pay for tax cuts and increased border spending.
Language matters
""Attitudes towards the bill are really subject to messaging,"" Kirzinger says, which speaks to the speed at which the thousand-page bill has gone through the lawmaking process.
""If you tell people that it would decrease funding for local hospitals, unfavorability increases to nearly 8 in 10. If you tell people it would increase the uninsured [population] by about 10 million people, unfavorability increases to 3 in 4.""
Republican lawmakers have downplayed the projected financial
impact to rural hospitals
and the number of people who could become uninsured, aiming to frame the proposed changes as targeting those who don't deserve coverage.
That's how Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, sold the proposal in
an opinion piece
for Fox News earlier this month.
""Every vulnerable American who needs Medicaid should be protected and have access to care,"" he wrote. ""That's why House Republicans have thoughtfully curated a bill that realigns incentives in Medicaid for states to care for the most vulnerable over individuals who aren't eligible for the program, including illegal immigrants.""

Democrats and health advocacy groups emphasize the projected impacts of the bill. ""Voting for this bill is voting to kick seniors out of nursing homes; it is voting to shut down hospitals in rural areas; it is voting to take coverage away from kids with disabilities,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.,
said in a press conference

The KFF poll found that people who currently have Medicaid are worried about losing coverage. ""A majority of them say it would be very difficult for them to see a health care provider or pay for any other form of health insurance coverage, and nearly two-thirds say it would be difficult for them to afford their prescription medications that they rely on,"" Kirzinger says.
""Most of them say it would have a major impact not only on their financial well-being and their overall quality of life, but also their mental and physical health,"" she adds."

All 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and U.S. territories have approved a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma, maker of Oxycontin, over the company's improper marketing of opioids.
The deal was filed with a federal bankruptcy court by Purdue Pharma officials in March after negotiations with state attorneys general and other stakeholders. If this plan is finalized, payouts will occur over the next 15 years.
In a statement, New York's Attorney General Letitia James said the plan will ""hold the Sackler family accountable"" for what she described as their ""leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addiction and overdoses.""
Sponsor Message
Under the outlines of the deal, members of the Sackler family who currently own Purdue Pharma are expected to contribute roughly $6.5 billion.
According to the company, a major change from past settlement deals will mean people who wish to sue the Sacklers in civil court for alleged wrong-doing will not be forced to give up those lawsuits.
""Creditors can preserve their right to take legal action against the Sacklers if they do not opt in to the Sackler releases contained in the Plan,""
Purdue Pharma said in a statement
.
The firm sent a statement to NPR on Monday describing approval of the reorganization plan by states and territories as a ""critical milestone"" in finalizing a deal to ""provide billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.""
The Sacklers have said repeatedly they did nothing wrong and committed no crimes.
NPR has reached out to members of the Sackler family for comment, but have yet to receive a response.
In a joint statement sent to NPR, attorneys suing Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers praised the deal.
""After five years of litigation and three years in bankruptcy, we are pleased that all 55 eligible states and territories have unanimously agreed to accept,"" said members of the National Prescription Opiate Litigation Plaintiffs' Executive Committee.
Sponsor Message
They said the deal would add ""more than $7 billion in much-needed funds to help communities across the country"" recovering from the opioid crisis.
Not everyone is satisfied with the deal. Ryan Hampton, an addiction recovery advocate who was addicted to Oxycontin and other opioids for more than a decade, said the deal only sets aside roughly $850 million to compensate direct victims of Purdue Pharma.
""I'd still give it an F at this point because it still falls short of anything meaningful that victims will receive,"" Hampton said. He estimated that his own direct payout would be roughly $3,500.
""Compared to how long and drawn out this process has been ... it is very little money,"" Hampton said, adding, ""I'm ready to put it behind me and move on with my life.""
This settlement will have to be approved by a federal bankruptcy court. Experts tell NPR, this version of the deal is likely to be accepted by the courts and by the U.S. Justice Department.
The DOJ's bankruptcy watchdog agency challenged earlier settlement attempts, leading to the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn a previous bankruptcy deal
with Purdue Pharma and Sacklers in July of 2024.
If finalized, this settlement will add to more than $50 billion in opioid pay-outs by corporations that profited from manufacture, distribution and retail of opioid painkillers at a time when overdoses and drug deaths were skyrocketing in the U.S."

When Chris Spears' pharmacy didn't have the obesity drug his doctor prescribed in 2023, he found another option while scrolling on Facebook. His feed was full of advertisements for alternatives to the brand-name medicine sold through online telehealth companies. So he tried one.
""The medication worked brilliantly, absolutely phenomenal. But what I didn't enjoy was ... the experience was clunky,"" Spears says.
So Spears, a former tech consultant who lives in Decatur, Ga., saw a business opportunity. He started his own weight loss telehealth company, OrderlyMeds, which signed up its first patient on January 1, 2024.
The company now serves 40,000 patients a month, he says. After customers complete health screenings, it connects them with health care providers who can write prescriptions, which are then filled by pharmacy partners.
Sponsor Message
These off-brand obesity drug alternatives aren't generics but have been available for several years. That's because the Food and Drug Administration allows specialized pharmacies to make what are essentially copies of brand-name drugs when the agency determines those
medicines are in short supply
. These are called compounding pharmacies. They're the kinds of partners OrderlyMeds has been working with. Soon, though, the company will also do its own compounding, Spears says.
High demand for obesity drugs and manufacturing constraints at the brand-name drugmakers created a boom in these dupes, called compounded drugs, and consumer websites to obtain them. Compounders that make the drugs and telehealth companies that sell them have offered cheaper, more readily available alternatives for patients.
Now the shortages of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly & Co.'s Zepbound are over. The FDA determined in December and February, respectively, that the companies could meet demand. Grace periods for the compounding pharmacies expired this spring. Some have already stopped compounding obesity drugs.
A new chapter for compounded obesity medicines
That change would mean the end of the large-scale compounding era for obesity drugs.
Some telehealth companies have transitioned to agreements with Novo Nordisk and Lilly to sell their medicines to patients without insurance. But others are producing their own medicines with a twist.
Sponsor Message
At OrderlyMeds, Spears recently said he is leasing a new facility in Tampa and hiring 100 people to make compounded tirzepatide and semaglutide – the active ingredients in Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, respectively.
He says OrderlyMeds will personalize the medicines by adding one of nine supplements, like vitamin B-12, based on patients' unique needs. That way, the drugs won't be copies, but individualized obesity drugs. Spears says OrderlyMeds will still be following ""the letter of the law,"" referring to the rules against making essentially copies of available medications.
Traditional compounding involves making drugs
according to doctors' orders to meet patients' personal requirements.

Patients scramble as cheaper obesity drug alternatives disappear
It's not clear whether OrderlyMeds' approach will work, but the telehealth platform is one of several companies testing the FDA's rules by continuing to make and sell the compounded drugs.
But where's the line between making ""essentially a copy"" of a commercially available drug and the personalized medicines compounding pharmacies have provided for decades?
""The line is not very well defined,"" says
Ameet Sarpatwari, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School
who focuses on pharmaceutical policy. ""I think that's why we're seeing certain companies who are willing to stay and test the waters.""
According to FDA's
guidance documents for industry
, Congress didn't bar just compounding of exact copies, but included the word ""essentially"" in the law ""to ensure that compounders do not evade the limits in this section by making relatively small changes to a compounded drug product and then offering the drug to the general public without regard to whether a prescribing practitioner has determined that the change produces for the patient a significant difference."" Minor changes in strength aren't enough, the document says.
Asked about some specific examples, like adding a B vitamin, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, referred NPR back to the guidance document but didn't answer the question directly.

Marketing of the compounded obesity drugs on social media has increased in recent months.
Last October, 40 ads for compounded obesity drugs started running on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta platforms, according to an NPR analysis of data from the company's ad library on April 30.
But in April of this year, after the brand-name shortages were over, nearly 2,000 ads started running.

The ads are for telehealth heavyweights such as Hims, as well as some smaller companies, including one called Mochi Health that has been sued by Eli Lilly. But the ads also include even lesser known companies selling alternatives to obesity drug injections, such as patches, drops and oral pills.
""When we got started, there was some crowding, but not nearly what it is today,"" says Spears, who is continuing to offer compounded tirzepatide despite getting
a cease and desist letter
from Eli Lilly in April.
Health Inc.
Eli Lilly sues companies selling alternative versions of its weight loss drug
Mochi CEO Myra Ahmad says the surge in ads reflect ""a significant mindset shift"" around personalized obesity treatment, and that its ad strategy is focused on ""comprehensive and customized care solutions.""
A trickle, then a flood
Compounding pharmacies have been around long before weight loss drugs. Their typical role is creating custom versions of medicines for patients who are, for example, allergic to an ingredient in the original version. They're usually prohibited from making ""essentially"" copies of available approved drugs, according to federal law, but they can do it if the original drug is in short supply.
That's what happened with obesity drugs. Demand was so high that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly couldn't keep up. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, went into short supply in
March 2022
, and tirzepatide's shortage began
that December
.
""It's an unfortunate situation that there was a shortage for the medicines,""
David Moore
, executive vice president of Novo Nordisk's U.S. operations, tells NPR. ""It was unprecedented demand … really no one could have anticipated.""
Sponsor Message
At first, just a few compounders were stepping in to make it, but that changed. And the compounders put a dent in brand-name sales.
In a May 7 call with Novo Nordisk investors, Moore said that compounded versions of its drug were so common that fewer people were taking the brand name Wegovy.
Scale of compounding is difficult to measure
Because most compounding pharmacies are regulated on the state level and are not required to report which drugs they're making, the total number of compounders making semaglutide and tirzepatide is a mystery. But the largest compounding pharmacies, called
outsourcing facilities
, report what they're making to the FDA.
In the first half of 2023, only one outsourcing facility told the FDA that it was making semaglutide. By the second half of 2024, the most recent data available, 10 said they were making it.
Loading...
According to a report by the
Brookings Institution
, the importation of ingredients used by compounders making obesity medicines grew, too. What are known as active pharmaceutical ingredients are largely imported from China, says report author Marta Wosinska, a health care economist who has held leadership roles at the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.
When she first looked at the import data, she thought it was a mistake. ""One kilogram is 4 million doses,"" she says. ""And you have shipments of 50 kilograms going through.""
The imported active ingredients aren't illegal, but they're not scrutinized by regulators to make sure they're safe either, she says. While the ingredient manufacturers are required to register with the FDA, that doesn't mean their factories have been inspected or that they're making the active ingredients used in compounded obesity drugs in line with a set standard. Until the drug goes generic, such a standard doesn't exist.
Welcome to the internet
Access to affordable compounded obesity medicines has been
life-changing for some patients
whose insurance doesn't cover them. It's helped many lose weight for the first time in their lives. But other patients have found themselves stuck with thousands of dollars worth of compounded medication they are afraid to use after

Without much federal oversight, it's hard for patients to know if a deal is too good to be true.
Sabina Hemmi was taking a compounded obesity medicine, when the price jumped from $550 a month to $875 a month. ""I was like, 'What the hell?' ""
She started shopping around, but found it confusing. Most telehealth sites offering compounded obesity drugs didn't list prices and wouldn't reveal them to would-be customers until after they'd filled out online forms with personal and medical information.
Treatments
Thinking of buying obesity drugs online? Read this first
So Hemmi, who founded a data company to help video gamers play better,
started a website
to help people sort through the mess. At first, it was just a listing of a few dozen companies and their prices. The website has since grown to include reviews and warnings about telehealth providers with ties to pharmacies cited for regulatory violations, for example.
Hemmi says new companies and websites ask every day to be added. Often, she says, the sites didn't exist two weeks earlier. She only adds new companies after vetting them.
As she's doing her due diligence, companies sometimes go from enthusiastically answering questions to being ghostly silent – especially when it comes to answering specifics about the identities of their health care providers. ""That's when they drop off.""
Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, says compounding pharmacies' products were never meant to compete with name brand drugs, but the confluence of drug shortages, high prices and limited insurance coverage created an unprecedented situation.
Many compounders are following state and federal regulations, filling only obesity drug prescriptions that doctors deem necessary for individual patients, he says.
""It's really easy to look at what's happening right now … as a bunch of greedy compounders trying to circumvent the FDA drug-approval system – and no doubt there's some opportunism at play here, particularly in the telehealth space – but that's not the full story,"" he says. ""And indeed, much of what we're seeing at present is not from compounding pharmacies at all, but from telehealth platforms, third-party marketers and illicit actors.""

If you can't beat 'em …
For their part, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are now adjusting to the marketplace the shortage created -- by offering some of their products at lower prices, on websites that continue to offer compounded versions of the drugs they invented. Both companies launched direct-to-consumer initiatives within the last year, offering the brand-name drugs at lower prices for patients not using their insurance.
On Monday, Eli Lilly
said that in July it will add the highest doses
of Zepbound — 12.5 milligrams and 15 milligrams — to its website for patients paying cash. That would make all FDA-approved doses available this way. The drugmaker also dropped the price for all self-pay doses of Zepbound to no more than $499 a month for people who renew within 45 days. Although Zepbound usually comes in an autoinjector pen, the discounted offer is for vials of medicine patients inject with an old-fashioned syringe.
""They're basically trying to get in this game,"" says Leigh O'Donnell, head of shopper insights at Kantar Media, a market research and consulting firm.
Novo Nordisk also recently partnered with several telehealth companies, including Hims and Hers, whose controversial Super Bowl Ad, ""Sick of the System,"" took a swipe at the company by including an injector pen in the same light blue as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic.
Now, brand name Wegovy is for sale on Hims' website through a direct-to-consumer offering right next to a compounded version. Hims told investors it plans to largely end compounded semaglutide, but that it would continue compounding personalized doses for some patients. According to a quarterly financial filing for investors, the company believes there are legal paths to continuing to offer certain compounded obesity medicines following the shortages.
As for Spears at OrderlyMeds, he says companies like his eventually won't be needed for people to access affordable obesity drugs, and he's OK with that.

Millions of people who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are facing changes, not only to what kinds of food they can buy, but how much money they receive, what they have to do to be eligible for the program, or if they qualify for benefits at all.
The Trump administration last week allowed more states

the budget reconciliation bill
currently includes deep cuts to the program. Some say they cannot imagine how they will keep themselves and their families fed if these new proposals are approved.

RFK Jr. wants to stop people using SNAP benefits to buy soda. Will it help?
"" It would start changing the calculation from 'how do I make this stretch to meet my needs?' to 'how much food do I need to eat in order to survive?'"" says Rook Smith, a graduating college student in Oregon who receives a little over $300 a month in benefits.
Smith does not receive family support and pays for college through a combination of loans and work — current SNAP rules require students to work 20 hours a week to receive benefits.
One study estimated
that nearly a quarter of undergraduate college students are food insecure.
"" Without it I would've had to make major changes, if not just drop out of college entirely,"" Smith says.
Analysis from the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office
suggests the cuts would reduce SNAP by nearly
$300 billion
— the largest cut in the program's history. More than 40 million people in the U.S. receive food assistance; some food policy
experts warn 1 in 4 could be affected
. They caution that many recipients would see their benefits reduced substantially or eliminated completely. Some states — unable to make up for the federal cuts — may choose to abandon the program altogether.
""It's hard to overstate how devastating that would be to low income families""
says Katie Bergh,
a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "" I think it has flown under the radar a little bit that the
Congressional Budget Office

""There's no way,"" says Tea Church, a single mom who lives in the rural town of The Dalles, Ore., about an hour outside Portland. Church has five children ranging in age from 10 to 18. ""If the requirement was 20 hours a week, that would drastically, negatively impact our family.""
One of Church's sons, whom she adopted after fostering, needs special care. ""Chronologically he is 11,"" says Church. ""Socially and emotionally, he's more like 6.""
Under current SNAP rules, some people qualify for an exemption from existing work requirements if they are caring for someone with a disability; it's unclear if Church's family would meet the requirements under the new rules.
She says finding child care for after-school and summer in her rural Oregon town is difficult and would be nearly impossible for a child with high needs.
"" It's not that I don't want to work or that I'm unable,"" says Church, who quit a full-time job at a community college to care for her children.  "" Working a regular job with a regular schedule isn't an option for us.""
Her family's current benefit is close to $450 a month, though it is increasing in the summer by $125 while her kids are home from school. SNAP she says, ""is a huge part of what keeps us afloat every month.""

The U.S. diet is deadly. Here are 7 ideas to get Americans eating healthier
Soda and candy on the banned food list
Another flashpoint in the Trump administration's rules around SNAP: sugar.
Last week, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that three more states — Utah, Idaho and Arkansas — would be eligible for waivers that would allow them to ban the purchase of sugary foods and drinks with SNAP benefits.
""Disallowing taxpayer funded benefits to purchase unhealthy items like soda, candy and other junk food"" is part of an effort to improve the American diet, Rollins said at a press conference.
Six states now have such policies; more than a dozen are pursuing them, primarily led by Republican state legislators.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would extend the ban to include ultra-processed food, though he acknowledged implementing such a policy would take time. Kennedy says these changes are part of a larger effort to mitigate chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
""If somebody wants to drink a soda pop, we have no problem with that, we believe that we have freedom of choice in this country,"" Kennedy said at the same press conference. ""It's about nutrition and there's no nutrition in these products. We shouldn't be paying for them with taxpayer money.""
Critics — including food experts and SNAP recipients — say fighting disease is not as simple as creating a banned foods list.
On a recent shopping trip, Tea Church took several of her kids along with her. Her 11-year-old son, Solomon, pointed to the back of a cereal box and considered the balance of sugar and protein.
""Six grams and protein 9,"" he said. ""I think the protein should be more.""
Tea — who worked with a nutrition expert and lost over 100 pounds recently — says nutrition is important in their family, but she also values choice and the ability to give her kids an occasional treat.
""Being able to give them something that doesn't negatively impact our budget is amazing,"" she says.
For her teenagers, soda and energy drinks occupy a unique role. ""It's a kind of social currency for them,"" she says.
Her 17-year-old daughter, Olivia, confirms this dynamic.
"" I feel like when you walk into first period in the morning, everyone has like a Red Bull, an energy drink — it's a social construct for sure,"" says Olivia.
Some of her peers come to school with Starbucks drinks that cost nearly $7 — a luxury she cannot afford. But having a Red Bull, she says, makes her feel more normal.

""I would never be able to be a part of that social pyramid if we didn't have the SNAP benefits that would pay for those.""
Fewer choices for people with fewer resources

meaningful ways to incentivize healthy eating

expanding benefits
rather than just restricting them.

Cities with soda taxes saw sales of sugary drinks fall as prices rose, study finds

with the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
""That data does not exist.""
Johnson cites
successful pilot programs
that encourage people to buy more fruits and vegetables through expanded access to these foods.
"" Just because somebody participates in SNAP doesn't mean that they don't deserve the same food choices that somebody who doesn't participate in SNAP has,"" says Johnson.
Some research
suggests people
who use SNAP drink about the same amount of soda as those who do not receive the subsidy.
Standing in the grocery store parking lot after her shopping, Church says she feels like the changes the administration is proposing don't take into account the fundamental purpose of the program.

Cynthia Cherish Malaran didn't like the piano lessons she took as a child, so it amused the native New Yorker that she found second-career success as a DJ a decade ago, spinning tunes for MTV, Lincoln Center and other clients.
""I was playing music for people, watching them forget about their stress and forget about whatever worries them and just be present on the dance floor,"" says Malaran, who would watch their catharsis from the sidelines. ""I never — even in my career as a DJ — thought of music for my own healing, until I really needed it.""

When a 'miracle drug' disappoints
That time came a decade ago when, at age 39, Malaran was diagnosed with breast cancer. Following chemotherapy and surgery, her best hopes of remaining cancer-free rested largely on
Herceptin
, a medicine so effective at targeting her specific form of disease that patients like her call it their ""miracle drug."" But after only a few rounds, Malaran proved allergic — and there was no substitute.
Malaran implored her oncologist, ""What should I do?"" The doctor responded, simply: ""Be happy.""
""I couldn't believe she said that,"" recalls Malaran.
How is that even possible?
Then she understood: ""I realized if I can manage my stress and my emotions, that I would have the best chances of surviving, even though I was taken off of treatment.""
Sessions over seven weeks
Managing the various
symptoms
and anxieties that often accompany cancer through music therapy, it turns out, is as effective as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy, according to
a study presented
at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting this month. The study involved seven weeks of a hybrid kind of therapy, combining talk, music and lyrical composition as forms of expression. During sessions, trained therapists might help put a patient's words or feelings to a melody, for example, or they might co-write a tune. Or simply listen.

Cancer deaths are declining, but diagnoses are rising especially among younger women
""There was a time period when these were viewed as kind of outside the mainstream,"" says Dr.
Kevin Liou

integrate auxiliary care
such as
acupuncture, herbal remedies and music therapy into their cancer treatment.
Millions of survivors
Because of so many improvements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, many millions more people are surviving the disease, often for many years. As a result, the population of cancer survivors has surged in recent decades to
18.6 million people
in the U.S. alone, according to the American Cancer Society's
most recent report
. With that, says Liou, comes more need for
varied therapies
to improve their quality of life.

The next phase of research is to look at characteristics of patients likely to benefit from music therapy, Liou says.

Art and music therapy seem to help with brain disorders. Scientists want to know why
For Malaran, music therapy was a natural fit. She found Liou's ""Melody Study"" through Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital. During sessions, Malaran sometimes wrote lyrics to express her emotions, or just hummed along, listening.
""Picture yourself feeling unwell and someone is serenading you — just you — and how much better you feel because you're being seen and cared for that way,"" Malaran explains.
The act of creation
Liou says what sets music therapy apart from passive listening or playing music on one's own is the therapeutic collaboration. Through conversation and music
creation
, patients access another way to process their emotions, he says.
""It's actively creating something, and you're doing it with the guidance of a trained music therapist.""
Malaran says music could give expression to emotions for which there were no apt words. The healing, she says, was in that expression: ""Creating something beautiful coming from my cancer is like the ultimate way for me to heal.""

She's now a decade in remission, and it's been three years since she completed the therapy, but she still hums whenever she feels uneasy.
""I don't even sing for fun. But humming is something I still do even today — years after those sessions — as a way to regulate my stress and bring my nervous system back to level ground and to relax,"" she says.
It happened just the other day, she says. She felt worries creep in, and then the vibrations calmed her."

Thank you, Dad, for standing up for your girls.
In rural Kenya, where we grew up, fathers were not expected to educate their daughters. Girls were to be married off – and not pursue an education and a career. The value of a girl was measured by her dowry, not a diploma.
jou
My father, Harrison Ngumbi, was different.
He and my mom had five children — one son and four daughters.
As he would say to us, ""I choose to educate you, my girls.""
His peers would ridicule him. They'd ask why he was wasting his money on school fees for his daughters when they'll just get married and leave.
Sponsor Message
I wanted to better understand his drive to educate us, so I called him up — he lives in Kenya and I now live 8,000 miles away in Illinois, where I'm a professor of entomology.
He says he respected girls and wanted his daughters to have a future. Perhaps he was influenced by his own mother — a single mom who worked relentlessly to raise four boys.
""It doesn't matter what my peers think,"" he told me. ""My girls are my priority, and I will do everything to ensure you have an education. I want to have future professors and doctors in the family.""
""Education is the only gift I can give you,"" dad would say when we were growing up. And he's often told us:
""Work hard and be the best you can be.""
My father's bold and reassuring words continue to play in my heart every day, inspiring me to persevere no matter what the challenge or circumstances.
Dad was an English elementary school teacher, but more than that he was visionary, a dreamer. More important, he was not afraid to defy societal norms. It was not an easy dream to follow.
He and my mother, who was also a teacher, faced a daunting reality: How to raise and educate his four daughters as well as his only son, my late brother, on a combined monthly salary of $200. Somehow, they did. But my parents had to sacrifice a lot.
Sponsor Message
I still remember how much they gave up. At the end of the month, my parents would go to the city to collect their salaries. They could have enjoyed a meal at a restaurant, eating whatever they wanted. Instead, they would return home in the evening, tired and hungry.
As a child, I could sense that they weren't just hungry for food — there were times when it was hard to put meals on the table -- but also hungry for our future.
Sometimes, my father was unable to pay full fees at the start of each the year's three semesters, so one of the school staff would send me home and tell me I could not come back without the money.
The shame was heavy. But my father never let shame win. The next very morning, he would take me back to school. He did also bring along his pay stub to the head teacher to show that he was not withholding any money and to ask for a payment plan.
And because he gave everything, he demanded that we be fully accountable.
When we'd receive our report card at the end of each term, he wanted us to put the card on the pillow on his side of the bed. If we failed to do so, he'd punish us. And he'd punish as well if our grades weren't good. He'd punish us until we'd cry – and then tell us not to cry.
But even more than the punishment, his silent disappointment was what hit me hardest – and made me resolve to do better.
My father's sacrifices and his belief that girls can make it – allowed me to keep on and stay on track on my academic journey. Today, I am a professor. My sisters also have careers. Faith counsels patients who are HIV positive, Kalekye is a consultant and manager for a health-care NGO and Kavuu is a nurse. My brother, Kennedy, who died in his 40s of a lung ailment, earned his CPA and became a local businessman and a farmer.

We are women with careers, voices and choices, all because our father stood by us, and chose to educate us, believing that what men can do, women can do it better.
Thank you, Dad, for defending and standing by our right to learn, for placing our future above your comfort, for refusing to sell your daughters. Because of you, I know the meaning of sacrifice and I have vowed to fight for the next girl who is told she is not worth the cost of an education. Thank you for standing up, for us, your four girls. We are blessed to have you as our father.

Dr. David A. Kessler has always been in the business of keeping people healthy – but by his own admission, he hasn't always applied that to himself.
Kessler's problem was with food. In medical school, greasy French fries and salted roast beef helped him stay up studying and researching late at night. Over the years, his weight fluctuated. He'd gain 20 or 40 pounds in a relatively short time frame, then slowly lose the weight, usually by going on a low-carb, high-protein diet, and exercising.
He went on to have a long career in public health, including a seven-year tenure as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s, where he advocated for better nutrition labels and against the tobacco lobby.

Living Better
Should you track your blood sugar with a continuous glucose monitor?
After spending two years stuck at a desk as chief science officer of the White House COVID-19 Response Team, Kessler had gained significant weight. His usual diet and exercise routine didn't help him shed pounds like it had in the past. Then an endocrinologist asked if he'd like to try one of the new class of glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, drugs that include Wegovy and Mounjaro.

He lost about 60 pounds within seven months of starting the injections. Kessler documents his experience in the new book
Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: The New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight.
He also breaks down the science behind obesity, and what makes these drugs so effective.
Here are eight takeaways from our conversation with Kessler about using the GLP-1 drugs, and the changing landscape of weight loss.
Flatiron Books/Joy Asico-Smith/NPR
1. Our food environment drives weight gain
Foods high in salt, sugar and fat that are ""highly palatable and energy dense"" are pretty much everywhere and our brain chemistry drives us to consume them, says Kessler.
""
We put [them] on every corner, and we made it available 24/7. We're living in a food carnival,"" he says. ""What did we expect to happen?""
Sponsor Message
Kessler calls these foods ""ultra-formulated"" (instead of ""ultra-processed"") because they've been engineered to manipulate the brain's reward system. They can activate the same reward centers that addictive drugs do. ""It's not willpower,"" he says. ""It's biology.""
He says GLP-1 drugs are remarkably effective in countering this pattern. ""They have changed the landscape of weight loss,"" says Kessler.
And while he'd like to see the ""root cause"" of obesity and related chronic diseases tackled, he says he's ""not optimistic that we're going to change the food environment overnight. In the meantime, these are effective tools.""

2. Being overweight isn't always unhealthy but one kind of fat is
While BMI or body mass index has long been used to measure obesity, Kessler is among a
growing number of scientists
who say it's not a helpful indicator of health.
Rather visceral fat, which is found in and around abdominal organs including the stomach, liver and intestines, is the driver of metabolic disease, says Kessler. Visceral fat leeches fatty acids called adipokines or chemokines, which cause systemic inflammation in the body.
""And that inflammatory state results in organ damage that leads to cardiometabolic disease, kidney disease, diabetes, certain forms of cancer, and potentially certain neurodegenerative changes,"" says Kessler.
You can get a rough estimate of whether you're carrying a risky amount of visceral fat by measuring your waist circumference, Kessler says. A circumference greater than 40 inches in men, or 35 in inches in women is a rough indicator. You can also calculate your
waist-to-hip ratio
.
A
body composition scan
can offer a more precise measurement.
Shots - Health News
Step aside BMI, body composition tests are on the rise. Here's what to know
3. On GLP-1 drugs, get comfortable with being uncomfortable
The great thing about these drugs, says Kessler, is that they allow you to relearn how to eat. But that comes with some caveats.
GLP-1 drugs are powerful appetite suppressants, Kessler says. They increase feelings of satiety,  making you feel full after a smaller portion than normal. They do this by slowing down the emptying of the stomach into the small intestine, thus keeping food in the stomach for longer.
This feeling of fullness can be unpleasant. Kessler describes it as being ""at the edge of nausea."" He compares it to the way your stomach might feel when you've eaten a bit too much at Thanksgiving dinner.
Sponsor Message
If you push through and keep eating anyway, you might experience GI issues like abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. In the book, Kessler acknowledges that you can't really separate those unpleasant feelings from the effective mechanism of the drugs themselves.
""There's great variability,"" Kessler says. Some people take the drugs and lose weight with no side effects.
But for most, he says, there's an element of negative reinforcement. ""If you know that if you put anything else in that stomach that's going to cause distress, you become conditioned to not to put more food in your stomach."" As a result, patients start eating less, he says, and avoiding heavy foods.
At their worst, side effects such as vomiting and nausea or hypoglycemia can land you in
the emergency room
.
""I don't think the companies have leveled with the American public on how these drugs work,"" says Kessler. They can be a powerful part of a plan to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, he says, but the drugmakers and the FDA should do more to educate consumers about the side effects.
4. Find a good doctor, or better yet, a team
The side effects are one reason it's important to work with a physician who can monitor your progress and help you find the right drug at the right dose. It could be your general practice doctor or an internist, says Kessler. Working with an obesity medicine specialist, he says, is ideal, though he acknowledges finding one may be a challenge.
And since taking this drug will change your eating habits, Kessler recommends working with a dietician or nutritionist along with a doctor.
With good medical care, he says, many people can still take pleasure in food at those smaller portion sizes.
5. Eat plenty of protein, and fiber
GLP-1 medications don't change the fundamentals of healthy eating, Kessler writes, and it's important to be mindful about your food choices on the drugs.
Sponsor Message
He says if you're trying to lose weight, with or without drugs, protein is key, because it increases feelings of fullness. And, it can take the place in your meal of some of the bad stuff.
""If you are increasing the protein, you're decreasing the rapidly absorbable carbohydrates, you're decreasing fat, excess calories, and sugar,"" says Kessler.
And when you are on a GLP-1 drug, he says it's super important to eat foods high in fiber. Remember, the drugs slow down the emptying of the stomach into the small intestine, and that can lead to things getting backed up further down the line, Kessler says.
""People think constipation is just constipation, but that constipation can turn into intestinal obstruction that can cause perforation and people can die,"" says Kessler. ""So keeping the GI tract healthy is essential.""
And stay hydrated.
6. Know the risks, including those that aren't on the label
Kessler worries about people taking the drugs going too far in the other direction – from overeating to
malnutrition
.
""From what I can tell, many people on these highly effective drugs are eating less than a thousand calories a day, some as low as 600 to 800, and that is a level of semi-starvation,"" says Kessler.
Kessler says drugmakers should do more to inform patients about the risks of developing eating disorders, and gastroparesis – a chronic condition where gastric emptying slows down significantly.
It's also common to lose some muscle mass along with fat while on these drugs, which can be problematic, Kessler writes. One study he cites in the book showed that 40% of the weight loss in patients on once-a-week injections of semaglutide came from lean body mass. And about a third of that was muscle. That's a reason to keep on top of your nutrition and strength-training while on these drugs, he writes, ""especially for older people like me, who are [already] susceptible to muscle loss.""
Sponsor Message
There are people who should steer clear of GLP-1 drugs, Kessler notes, including those with a personal or familial history of
certain thyroid and endocrine cancers
, those with chronic kidney disease, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, uncontrolled diarrhea or constipation or gastroparesis, or if you are pregnant.
7. Compounded versions of the drugs may be riskier
Kessler says compounded GLP-1s, which are often cheaper than brand-name drugs and can be ordered online,
carry additional risks.
""A drug that's been approved by the brand name manufacturers…There are inspections, there's standards to make sure what's in the injectable actually matches what's on the label. The FDA's on top of it,"" says Kessler.
Whereas in compounded medicines, the active ingredients are manufactured abroad, shipped in bulk, and distributed to compounding pharmacies through middlemen. ""I'm not even sure everyone can trace back where the drugs are being made,"" he says.
Shots - Health News

8. When it comes to going off GLP-1s, not much guidance is available
When Kessler reached his personal weight-loss target, he was developing some slight abdominal pains, so he decided to stop.
Once he went off the drug though, Kessler says he was flying blind when it came to maintaining his weight. And he thinks that's a problem.
""The companies and the FDA, no one's identified an endgame with these drugs,"" Kessler says.
He says there's very little data on whether or how the dose should be titrated to wean patients off, or how to adjust when your appetite and cravings start to return. In addition to working with your doctor to come off the drug, Kessler recommends a high-protein diet, because protein replicates the feelings of satiety you get from a GLP-1 drug, and may help you to sustain a lower weight.
Since that first seven months, he's been on and off the drug again.

""
But that's not the way we should be using drugs, flying blind, coming up with our own solutions,"" he says. ""Companies have to study this. The FDA has to require how to use these drugs safely."""

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has upended medical research and public health in the U.S. in many ways. One of the ideas that could be influencing his overhaul of federal health agencies dates back to ancient Greece.
The
miasma theory
is one of the first ideas that civilization hatched to try to explain why people get sick.
""It goes back to Hippocrates,"" says Dr.
Howard Markel
, an emeritus professor of medical history from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. ""He wrote in a book called
Epidemics
, that epidemics came from some type of pollution – some pollution of the atmosphere, of the air that we breathe. And hence we got terrible infectious diseases.""
Sponsor Message
This idea that, in essence, bad air caused illness was later championed by many others, including Florence Nightingale. It also led to some things that did help fight diseases, like cleaning up sewage.
But then came the
germ theory
— one of humanity's big eureka moments. Scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch discovered it wasn't some mysterious stench in the air from rotting garbage that spread diseases. Instead, it was living microscopic entities.
""They discovered what we know as germs – microbes,"" says
Melanie Kiechle
, a historian at Virginia Tech. ""Bacteria and viruses and other microscopic materials were actually what caused illness and also explained the spread of illness from one person to another. So miasma theory is debunked, essentially.""
The discovery of germs led to breakthroughs like antibiotics and vaccines.
But in a book
Kennedy
published about four years ago,
The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health,
the now- health secretary harkens back to the miasma theory.
""Miasma theory emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses,"" Kennedy writes.
But experts say one problem is how Kennedy defines miasma theory.
Sponsor Message
""I will categorically say that miasma theory, as historians of medicine and science understand it, is not what he is saying it is, period,"" says
Nancy Tomes
, a historian of germ theory at Stony Brook University, who wrote
The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women and the Microbe in American Life.
But Kennedy's take may help explain some of his policies, especially about vaccines.
""The miasma theory is the notion that there are environmental poisons, not necessarily rotting organic matter,"" says Dr.
Paul Offit
, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania. ""For him, those environmental poisons are electromagnetic radiation, pesticides, vaccines. Vaccines are, for him, a modern-day miasma.""
And that's dangerous, many experts say.
""Can stress, air pollution, other things, make infections worse? Yes. But the cause of infections is a microorganism,"" says Dr.
Tina Tan
, who heads the Infectious Disease Society of America. ""It's the microorganisms that are making people sick.""
And vaccines have clearly been shown to safely and effectively protect people against dangerous microorganisms, Tan and others say.
""He's trying to give this false veneer of intellectualism by saying, 'Oh, the miasma theory,'"" says Dr.
Amesh Adalja
, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Health Security. ""This all just obfuscation to support his idea that vaccines are not valuable.""
But some other observers argue that Kennedy's ideas about the miasma and germ theories aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
""The real debate here is whether we can solve public health problems by developing treatments like vaccines, antibiotics, or other drugs? Or whether we will solve these problems by strengthening people's immune systems through healthier habits?"" says
Gregg Girvan
, a resident fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a Washington think tank. ""And my response is, 'Why can we not acknowledge that there is truth in both positions?'""

One health expert called the document ""willful medical disinformation"" about the safety of COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women.
""It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it's just not there,"" said Dr.

The announcement,
made on the social media platform X
, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.

COVID vaccine changes confuse and upset some parents and families
The HHS document meant to support Kennedy's decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress, according to Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the office of Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash.
Titled ""Covid Recommendation FAQ"", the document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy's announcement from the agency.
Medical experts who reviewed all the citations in the FAQ said it distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished.
HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News: ""There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.""
HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.

the HHS document cites is under investigation by its publisher, Sage Journals, regarding ""potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest,"" according to a link on

The FAQ draws on the preprint to claim that ""post-marketing studies"" of COVID vaccines have identified ""serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis"" — conditions in which the heart's muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
Sponsor Message
While research early in the pandemic did find that, new research not included in the memo indicates that the risk has fallen with new vaccine protocols.
And the HHS document omitted numerous other
peer-reviewed
studies that have shown that the
risk of myocarditis
and pericarditis is greater after contracting COVID for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
One the 2024 preprint coauthors
refuted the idea
that their research found myocarditis and pericarditis were caused by the COVID shots, rather than COVID infection, noting that the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the COVID virus.
The study also focused only on children and adolescents.
O'Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the COVID pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of COVID vaccines were spaced further apart.
Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O'Leary said, referring to the CDC's
Vaccine Safety Datalink
. ""There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,"" he said.
Congress relies on health agencies for accurate guidance
In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims about dangers to pregnant women that are
actively refuted
by
the papers
it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines for pregnant women.
The HHS document says that another
paper it cites
found ""an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine."" But the paper doesn't contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
""I've now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,"" said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.

If he were grading the HHS document, ""I would give this an 'F,'"" Turrentine said. ""This is not supported by anything and it's not using medical evidence.""
While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said Dr.
Neil Silverman,
a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
""They're going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,"" Silverman said.
The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Rep. Schrier's office did receive a copy of the document.
""The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don't have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,"" O'Leary said.""
C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration's policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
""This feels like it's breaking new ground. I don't think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,"" Young said.

Until recently, it's likely many people hadn't heard much about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel.
But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, plays a key role in determining which vaccines children and adults receive, what gets covered by insurance and which shots are made available free of charge to millions of low-income children. So the panel's decisions ultimately affect the health of all Americans.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the unprecedented step of
dismissing all 17 members of the panel
on Monday. Two days later, he announced the names of
eight of the people
he has chosen to replace them.

Policy-ish
RFK Jr. names new slate of vaccine advisers after purging CDC panel
Several of Kennedy's new selections for the panel rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they criticized government policies on school closures and lockdowns, and the mRNA vaccines. One,
Vicky Pebsworth
, has served on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center — an advocacy group that warns against vaccine risks.
Some immunization and infectious disease specialists worry that the newly constituted committee is skeptical of vaccines and could vote to downgrade the importance of some shots, and ultimately make it more difficult for families to get them.
""I am very concerned,"" says Dr. Walter Orenstein, who served as director of the U.S. immunization program at the CDC from 1988 to 2004 and is now professor emeritus of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. ""I have spent a career of more than 50 years in vaccinology, and I have never seen the names of most of those people.""
Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, calls the changes to ACIP a ""disaster.""
""Imagine if you took all the air traffic controllers in the U.S. and just fired them and you replaced them with people that not only didn't really know how to be air traffic controllers, but several of them didn't even believe in flying,"" he says.
Shots - Health News
RFK Jr. says Americans were healthier when his uncle was president. Is he right?
In a statement, HHS defended Kennedy's choices for the committee, saying they are ""highly credentialed doctors, scientists, and public health experts committed to evidence-based medicine, gold standard science, and common sense.""
The statement said that the group ""will demand definitive safety and efficacy data for any new vaccine recommendations,"" and that they will review the current vaccine schedule.
Recommendations that affect insurance coverage
The members of ACIP meet at
least three times
a year to sift through the scientific data on vaccines and determine which ones are recommended for different age groups. If the CDC approves ACIP's recommendations, that can lead to a vaccine becoming part of the official immunization schedule for children and adults.
Sponsor Message
It also means insurance has to pay for it. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are required to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines.
ACIP's recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children program, a federally funded initiative that provides free access to low-income and underinsured children. Around half of all children in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines from the program, says Orenstein.
That means any changes to the vaccines recommended by ACIP ""would be a major potential barrier to access for vaccines for a substantial proportion of the children in this country if they took it from a vaccine off of the schedule,"" Orenstein says.
He helped launch the Vaccines for Children program in the aftermath of a huge measles resurgence from 1989 to 1991 that resulted in tens of thousands of cases and over 120 deaths. Many of the kids who got sick had not been vaccinated because their families couldn't afford it.
ACIP's recommendations often help guide which immunizations are required for school entry.
Guidance that influences how doctors practice
The wording of the committee's recommendations matters too. A routine recommendation calls for all people within a given age or risk group to get a specific vaccine, unless there is a medical reason not to. But ACIP can also choose to recommend a vaccine under what's called shared clinical decision-making – which means a doctor and a patient decide together if it makes sense.
""Generally, we don't really like shared clinical decision-making because it makes it less of a priority for clinicians to talk to their patients about a vaccine,"" says Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer for the Association of Immunization Managers.
It also makes it harder to have a clear, direct conversation with families, says O'Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who is also a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
Sponsor Message
""What I've heard anecdotally from pediatricians is, what [families will] say is, well, you guys are the experts. If you can't figure out what the right thing to do is, you know, how do you expect us to do that in a ten-minute office visit?"" O'Leary says.
That designation can also make it less likely that a medical provider will keep a vaccine in stock, he says. O'Leary notes that most pediatricians and many other health care providers in the U.S. participate in the Vaccines for Children program and are required to keep routinely recommended vaccines in stock. But that's not the case when a vaccine is recommended under shared clinical-decision making.
""Already it's very challenging for a lot of mostly family medicine physicians in rural areas to stock vaccines because it financially is very challenging for them,"" O'Leary says.
He says recommending a vaccine under shared clinical decision-making could potentially make it less available, especially in rural areas.
The CDC's recently changed the recommendations on COVID vaccines for children to shared clinical decision-making, and O'Leary says that has already sown confusion among parents and pediatricians alike. He worries that, if the new ACIP moves more vaccines to that designation, it will ""sow distrust in the process.""
""It makes it look like these vaccines aren't important and these vaccines are very important. They save lives every day,"" he says."

Night had fallen hours ago, but Billiance Chondwe was not slowing down.
On Feb. 20, he frantically tapped out texts on WhatsApp, dialed distant acquaintances and left voice messages from his home in Zambia. He'd pause only to close his eyes and think of whom else he could reach out to for help.
He urgently needed to find medication for Diana Lungu. She's an orphan, she's 9 — and she's HIV-positive. She'd run out of the daily pills she takes to suppress the virus. Without the pills, the virus would surge back.
""I called the whole night … calling everyone,"" remembers Chondwe, 53, a reverend known in his community simply as Pastor Billy. ""I slept around 3 a.m.""

One of his messages found its way to Thailand, where Susan Hillis was standing in an airport check-in line. It was the wee hours of the morning there, and she was heading home to the U.S. from a conference of Christian mission hospitals. As she listened to the message, Hillis could sense the exhaustion and fear in Pastor Billy's voice — and she knew how much Diana means to him.
""I was about four people from checking in, and I had tears in my eyes and was choked up,"" recalls Hillis, an epidemiologist who has spent years on HIV/AIDS work. ""I was thinking: 'She's going to die. She is going to die.'""
It was through her work in the faith community that she first connected with Pastor Billy — and learned about Diana, a girl with short cropped hair and a cautious but bright smile.
Over the years, Pastor Billy and his wife, Catherine Nanyangwe Chondwe, have taken more than 15 orphans into their home — raising them for periods of time alongside their own five children. ""Some were sleeping in the kitchen, others in the sitting room,"" he says.

An AIDS orphan who is HIV-positive herself, Diana has lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.
Diana's HIV medications and her medical care have been provided by a U.S.-funded clinic with a big salmon-colored gate in her town of Kapiri Mposhi. And a U.S. program supporting AIDS orphans provided Diana with monthly food packages — often fish, beans and cornmeal. Proper nutrition is critical when taking HIV drugs.
PEPFAR — the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — paid for all of it.
Then came inauguration night.
Half a world away, in Washington, D.C., President Trump signed an executive order with a Sharpie, freezing almost all foreign aid. A flurry of stop-work orders followed, as did program terminations for billions of dollars of international health programs.
From one day to the next, Diana's HIV clinic went from providing lifesaving medications to closing its doors. There was no warning and no time to get her medical file and transfer it to another clinic. The monthly package of food also stopped without warning.
By that time, Pastor Billy's church had transferred him to a different town. He'd found someone in Diana's community — Jennifer Mukuka — to welcome her in.

""I don't have much, but I just have this big heart,"" says Mukuka. She has been able to bear the cost of raising Diana because of the aid from PEPFAR, which also covered fees for her school books and uniform.
And that kind of security has given Diana space to dream of her own future. On her 20-minute walk to school — down dusty, craggy roads — she often imagines becoming a doctor, with a white coat and stethoscope, moving from one bedside to the next.

""Successful"" and ""unsung""
Diana was one of 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children supported last year by PEPFAR.
PEPFAR spokespeople often point out that the program has saved more than 26 million lives since its launch in 2003. And it has also helped children on a massive scale. Starting in 2006 — just a few years after then-President George W. Bush created the initiative — a bipartisan team of Democrats and Republicans made sure that 10% of the funding each year was set aside for AIDS orphans and vulnerable children. Last fiscal year, PEPFAR spent just over $200 million on these youngsters — about $31 per child supported.

AIDS often kills people in their childbearing years and has left
millions of orphaned children
in its wake. PEPFAR's vision was to enable local families to take in these orphans by providing basics — not only medicine but also food, clothing and school fees, as well as psychosocial support to address stigma. The program defined orphans as children who had lost one or both parents to AIDS, and the children did not necessarily have HIV themselves.
The U.S. government's PEPFAR program provided AIDS orphans with food, clothing, school fees — and medicine if they were HIV-positive, like Diana. Now, without aid, Diana and the family she lives with are scrambling to provide these necessities. Here, Diana eats breakfast before heading to school.

— the infectious disease physician who oversaw PEPFAR from 2009 to 2013
— says it's hard to overstate the impact of this program that is at once ""very successful"" and ""largely unsung.""
""The orphan-and-vulnerable-children response that PEPFAR created was bigger than the Catholic Church, all added up in every country, in terms of the number of orphans saved,"" says Goosby, now a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. ""That was the largest effort on the planet.""
Now it's mostly on hold.

In an emailed statement, the U.S. State Department said that while HIV treatment and care are allowed to continue, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, ""all other PEPFAR-funded services are being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy.""
The department did not respond to NPR's questions about when the review would be completed and what the 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as their caregivers, should do in the meantime. The statement did say that children and adults who are both HIV-positive and malnourished can get food support. While Diana has lost her food packages and is often hungry, she is not considered malnourished, according to Pastor Billy and Mukuka.
How budget negotiations unfold will likely impact which parts of PEPFAR continue.
""Everything was stopped, and it's not coming back — except [HIV] treatment,"" says one U.S. civil servant who has spent years working at high levels on the United States' HIV/AIDS efforts and who requested anonymity because they are concerned that speaking out could harm their career.

Flashing back to the death of his twin
For Pastor Billy, there was a very personal sense of urgency.
Growing up in Kitwe, Zambia, he was one of 13 children. During meals in the family's three-room house, he always sat next to his twin sister and best friend: Charity. ""We [would] eat from the same plate,"" he says. And they'd play. She'd kick the soccer ball with him. He'd skip rope with her. ""We were so close. It was lovely.""

When the twins became teenagers, Pastor Billy says that a businessman lured Charity away. This businessman promised a more luxurious lifestyle than their family could offer. The twins' father was a cook at the local hospital.
But when Charity returned from spending time with the businessman, she was sick.
""She developed something like a rash — when she pressed [the lesions], water [came out],"" remembers Pastor Billy. The rash spread all over her face and arms and soon down to her legs.
Pastor Billy lost his twin sister, Charity, to HIV/AIDS. After she was diagnosed in 1989, he cared for her at home. She died about two years later. ""It brought me to my knees,"" he remembers.

At the clinic in Kitwe, she was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. At the time, in 1989, there were no medications or treatments for AIDS in Zambia.
So Billy nursed her at home in their kitchen. Soon, she couldn't walk or even stand. Still today, he can instantly conjure up the image of her skeletal frame and the smell that permeated through the house as her condition deteriorated.
""Sometimes if I [was] out, she would be calling for me,"" he says. ""There was one time I stopped going to school, like for a month, because she only wants me to be around.""

Two years after her symptoms started, Charity died. ""It brought me to my knees,"" Pastor Billy remembers. ""It brought me to a point where [I realized] no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit. But at that time of sensing that limitation, I turned to God.""
He became a pastor in 1994 as HIV/AIDS pounded the country and region. Until the 1980s, life expectancy had been steadily rising in Zambia. But as the HIV epidemic took off, life expectancy plummeted from 56 to 46 over the course of 15 years, according to

When PEPFAR was founded in 2003, there were
more than 10 million children globally
who had lost one or both parents to AIDS. ""When children are deprived of a parent early in life, they have a significantly increased risk of exposure to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, school dropout, poverty,"" explains Hillis. She co-authored a
paper in
The Lancet
in May
citing research showing that, across 14 countries, children who have lost one or both parents are at six times the risk of contracting HIV.
Part of what drove Bush to incorporate orphans and vulnerable children into PEPFAR was a religious sense of compassion, says
John Stover
, vice president at Avenir Health, a group that analyzes data and policies for public health programs. ""[Bush] had a lot of support from Christian groups — evangelicals and others — who were largely focused on improving the lot of children in Africa,"" he says.
There was also a practical reason for caring for this group of children, says
Dr. Chris Beyrer
, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. Children who had lost their parents were ""perceived to be very vulnerable to groups like militias and extremist organizations and gangs,"" he explains, pointing out that this was one of the reasons President Bill Clinton declared AIDS a threat to national security.

""No, no, no, no, no""
Pastor Billy also saw AIDS as a threat. As a new pastor, he saw members of his congregation start falling ill just like Charity had. ""They were showing symptoms of my twin sister,"" he recalls. ""I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no.'""
The funerals became so frequent that Pastor Billy was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard.
When services wrapped up, he'd often have another time-sensitive task: figuring out what would happen to the orphaned children. He'd scramble to find relatives and community members to take them in, given the stigma of being associated with an AIDS death. And if nothing else worked, he and his wife would open their home.
""My wife's nursing our first child — [and] she's now a mother of seven,"" he remembers.
""It felt like a miracle""
In 1996, far from Zambia, there was an extraordinary turn of events, says Beyrer. Fifteen years after AIDS came on the scene, a very effective treatment was discovered: a combination of drugs that could suppress the virus's replication to extremely low levels.
The results are often described in biblical terms.
""People who are on their deathbeds, wasting away with diarrhea and thrush and fevers, would get on these meds and, literally, rise up off their deathbeds,"" says Beyrer. ""That's what was called the Lazarus effect — like Lazarus raised from the dead."" The patients, he says, would ""gain weight and go back to school and parenting and working. And it felt like a miracle.""
But this was a miracle only for high-income countries. Prior to PEPFAR, the treatment cost so much that it was essentially unavailable for people in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was the worst. Only when PEPFAR was established did low- and middle-income countries partake in the miracle.

Pastor Billy delivers a sermon in April to his congregants at the Somone Community Centre, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia. He remembers that at the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s, the funerals became so frequent that he was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard.

Hillis remembers a trip to Africa, after PEPFAR was launched, where she realized that the roadside carpenters were no longer displaying caskets for sale — a brisk business when AIDS was at its height. Instead, they were lining the street with handmade beds. ""Both of them you lay down in,"" Hillis remembers thinking to herself. But one, ""you lay down to rest because you're going to get up in the morning and live a vibrant life.""
As the drugs enabled parents to survive and give birth to children who were not infected with the virus, Pastor Billy focused more fully on the orphans who'd been left behind.
It was in 2016 when he met Diana, just days after she was born. He'd been helping her mother during a rough pregnancy where she was ""always sick."" And he went to the hospital hoping to celebrate another child born HIV-free to an HIV-positive mother, thanks to modern medications.
But as Diana's first year unfolded, it became clear that she needed to be tested for HIV. She ""was always suffering from diarrhea. She was weak, always underweight,"" recalls Pastor Billy. He was left wondering whether her mother hadn't taken her HIV medicine as consistently as necessary. He helped get Diana tested for HIV, and then, once the results confirmed his suspicion, he made sure she got on medication to suppress the virus at one of the U.S.-funded clinics in town.
Diana's life stabilized until two devastating family deaths. The girl's mother passed away as she neared her third birthday. Diana moved in with her grandmother — and Pastor Billy and his wife started to help more. For several years, Diana and her grandmother stayed in the pastor's house whenever they walked the 7 miles into town to access the clinic. And in 2021, when Diana's grandmother died, Diana moved in.

""You see pieces of brokenness at different stages in her life,"" says Pastor Billy. ""My heart usually bends toward brokenness.""
For a year, Diana grew up among his own children. She often reminded Pastor Billy of his twin sister.
Then, in 2022, Pastor Billy and his wife faced a difficult decision. The church asked them to move to a city four hours away. He wanted to take Diana but also felt she would benefit from staying in Kapiri Mposhi, the only place she'd really known. Plus, he had dreams of continuing his religious studies in the U.S. and knew it could be logistically challenging to formally adopt Diana so that she could travel with his family.
So Pastor Billy took the new assignment — but makes a point to visit Diana in her new home regularly. Whenever he does, Diana's face lights up. In that smile, he felt a sense of hope: Diana's generation might be the last one so badly scarred by AIDS, he thought.
Others felt the same. ""We've been so close to truly having an AIDS-free generation of kids,"" says
Dr. Rachel Vreeman
, chair of the Department of Global Health and Health Systems Design at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""And that is completely at risk right now.""
""There isn't enough food""
In February of this year, Diana had her first hint that something was amiss.
On that 20-minute walk to school, dreams of her future stethoscope were accompanied by pangs of hunger. The monthly packages of food the U.S. had provided for Diana had stopped. And Jennifer Mukuka had lost the stipend she got for transporting medications from Diana's U.S.-funded HIV clinic to far-flung patients.
Now, there's often not enough food in the three-room house they share with Mukuka's adult daughter and two young grandchildren.
Outside Jennifer Mukuka's three-room house, where Diana now lives, Mukuka prepares a lunch of pumpkin leaves and groundnuts. Sometimes, Mukuka says, the family has only enough food to cook one meal a day of beans and a maize porridge called nshima.

In a quiet voice and speaking in Bemba, her native language, Diana says, ""Because there isn't enough food, I sometimes don't feel well."" HIV medication must be taken with food; otherwise it can make the person feel very unwell — one of the reasons PEPFAR usually provided food along with drugs.
It's not just food that's in short supply. Her drugs are no longer readily available. Diana's U.S.-funded clinic closed so quickly after the stop-work orders came out in late January that Mukuka couldn't get Diana's medical file or a transfer letter allowing her to restart care at a Zambian government-run clinic. So Mukuka travels to nearby clinics begging for medication to last Diana until they can get the documents she needs to transfer to the government clinic — or until the U.S.-funded clinic reopens, if it does.
The State Department has issued waivers that lifesaving treatment can continue, including treatment and care for HIV. In an emailed statement, the department said that the organizations implementing lifesaving HIV programs ""were notified and urged to resume approved service delivery. Agencies have been working with their implementers to resume activities as quickly as possible.""
However, many U.S.-funded clinics have not resumed services yet. Where Diana lives, PEPFAR funding for HIV clinics came via USAID, which has been dismantled by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Without USAID, it has been hard for services and programs to resume even if they receive a waiver. Diana's former clinic has not reopened.
Pastor Billy has lost hope that it might open its doors again. ""It's closed forever,"" he says.
""We go to different centers, and [we're] just literally scrounging for medication. Sometimes they give us a two-week supply, sometimes a one-week supply,"" says Mukuka, also speaking in Bemba.
""I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same,"" says Jennifer Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive and who takes care of Diana. When she couldn't get Diana HIV medications because of the U.S. aid cuts, she shared her own medicine.

But a handful of times, the scrounging hasn't yielded anything. That means they are sometimes entirely out of Diana's medications. Mukuka says she wakes up in the middle of the night worried about what to do.

""I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same,"" says Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive. She recalls her nighttime debate about whether she should give Diana her own HIV pills that she gets from a government hospital.
She weighs the dilemma: Diana is young with her whole life ahead of her — she needs the pills. But Diana is also reliant on her, as are her daughter and grandchildren. In the end, she settled on an answer: ""Rather than letting her go without medication, I give her my medication,"" says Mukuka.
That worries Pastor Billy, who says: ""God save Diana. That she doesn't develop symptoms because the dosage was too much or was less or it might be wrong.""
Even then there are crisis points — like the night of Feb. 20, when Pastor Billy learned that Diana was entirely out of medicine. Eventually that night, he found a man one town over from Diana who could help. ""He said, 'We can share for five days,'"" recalls Pastor Billy, who quickly went to his church to solicit donations for the money needed to transport the medications in a shared taxi from the nearby town to Diana's town.
Diana has, at times, gone a week or two without her medication, Mukuka admits. She knows that when people skip their daily HIV medications, the virus can become drug resistant. ""When I couldn't get medication for Diana, I was extremely stressed,"" she says.
Pastor Billy and Mukuka have spent months trying to get Diana's file from the clinic so she can register at the closest government hospital. The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment about why its medical facilities require past medical files, given the situation.
As they navigate the process, Diana has been taking whatever supply they can get. ""Two weeks, one week, two weeks, sometimes even days,"" says Pastor Billy.
But this past week, he says, he breathed a sigh of relief when he got a phone call announcing that she had been able to get a month's supply of her medication from the district hospital. ""She's now getting the medicine, but the consistency is [still] not there,"" he says, noting that she used to get a six-month supply.
He says he feels surrounded by warnings about what might happen. At his church, others are falling ill without their HIV medications. And he has sent Hillis a message about how he's starting to notice that carpenters are displaying caskets again on the roadside.
""Kids will go hungry""
While the Trump administration has, in the days and weeks following the inaugural proclamations about frozen aid, made a commitment to providing lifesaving treatment like Diana's drugs, the prospect of other support for AIDS orphans — food, clothing, bedding, school fees, counseling — is less promising.
""Kids will go hungry. Kids will drop out of school. Kids will be subjected to transactional sex to be able to survive. This is exactly what will happen,"" says the U.S. civil servant who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. ""It's just absolutely atrocious, in my opinion, that we're now bringing back, potentially, another generation of HIV-positive young people, which could have been totally avoided.""
Goosby, who used to run PEPFAR, is adamant that the entirety of the program for orphans and vulnerable children should be allowed as part of the waiver for lifesaving aid.
""What could be more lifesaving than taking a child, feeding them and educating them?"" he says, arguing that interventions that aren't a pill can still be lifesaving.
""It really, truly does feel that we are going backward,"" adds Beyrer of Duke.
Pastor Billy and Diana share a close bond. When Pastor Billy visits Diana, she lights up with a smile. Here, they share a laugh before she walks to school.

For Diana and Mukuka, their hope is pinned to small snacks and thin plastic baggies — some filled with about a quarter cup of flour, others with a similar amount of sugar. They use whatever money Pastor Billy can spare to buy the supplies and sell them to neighbors. Each goes for under 20 cents. They hope it will add up to enough money for food and the basics for school — books, notebooks and a uniform. But Mukuka must also feed her daughter and grandchildren — and pay rent.
On a Wednesday in April, Pastor Billy got up early to make the hourslong drive to check on Diana. He caught her before she set off on her walk to school. She lit up, as usual, when she saw him. She calls him ""father."" They took pictures together, making goofy faces.
Then it was time for her to head to school — and for Pastor Billy to drive back home, wondering what to do next. These months of uncertainty, along with the frantic searches for medicine and food, have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems he used to depend on — and also Diana's vulnerability.
He got into the car thinking that his plans to study religion in the U.S. might need to take a back seat to Diana's needs.
""Love is not somebody who visits and takes a picture and puts it on the fridge,"" he says. Perhaps, he thinks,
he and his wife should stay in Zambia — and adopt Diana.
Diana heads off to school, a 20-minute walk from her home.

artpartner-images/Getty Images
Take a big inhale through your nose. Now, exhale.
Breathing may seem simple, but it's controlled by a complex brain network. Each inhale gives the human brain information about the external world. And now, a new research paper in the journal
Current Biology
suggests that humans have unique breathing patterns, almost like nasal ""fingerprints.""
One of the study authors, neurobiologist
Noam Sobel
says the idea that people might have these individual patterns isn't entirely novel.
""Many things are very common across all our brains, but at the end of the day, you have your unique brain,"" Sobel says. ""And since so much of the brain is involved in this process, we hypothesize that, therefore, respiration would also be unique.""
Sponsor Message
But researchers didn't have a way to test this theory — until PhD student
Timna Soroka
and Sobel's team at the Weizmann Institute of Science developed a new device.
It looks like a small oxygen tube. For the study, 100 participants wore continuously for 24 hours while they went about their daily activities. When the researchers analyzed the data, they saw that each person had a different nasal airflow pattern.
They also saw that those breathing patterns could predict measures of physical and mental health, like sleep, anxiety and depression.
Sobel says this insight opens up a chicken-and-egg problem: Namely, whether
changing
the way a person breathes could change health.
""The way cooler outcome is not 'you breathe this way because you're depressed,' but rather, 'you're depressed because you breathe this way,'"" he says. ""And if that's true ... can we teach you to breathe, you know, to be less depressed or to or to be less anxious?""
While researchers wouldn't recommend you hold your your breath until they determine which is true, the study is as a good reminder to take a moment to breathe today.

Federal officials on Wednesday appear to have ""revoked"" the layoffs of more than 400 employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been abruptly dismissed months ago, which may reinstate the entire staff of a laboratory that tracks viral hepatitis and most employees in one of the CDC's environmental health divisions.
The workers were among thousands that the Department of Health and Human Services laid off on April 1 as part of a reduction in force at the agency, most of whom are still out of work.
Employees of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention accounted for 214 of the staff ""expected to receive the rescission of RIF notifications,"" according to an email to the group from its acting director, Dr. Renáta Ellington, that was reviewed by NPR. The division's two laboratories that dealt with
viral hepatitis
and sexually transmitted diseases had been shuttered completely, despite the fact that some of those scientists performed disease surveillance work unlike any other labs in the world.

Investigations
In the middle of a hepatitis outbreak, U.S. shutters the one CDC lab that could help
More than 150 people who worked for the National Center for Environmental Health were also among the reinstated workers, according to three CDC employees familiar with the cuts. The center's Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, which includes employees based in Atlanta who work on asthma and air quality, environmental
emergencies
and lead poisoning prevention, may be almost entirely reinstated, two division employees told NPR.
At least 95 workers from other CDC divisions account for the rest of the employees who were notified on June 11, according to two CDC workers familiar with the cuts.
HHS notified CDC employees on Wednesday afternoon by email, copies of which were obtained by NPR. The email said the agency had ""revoked"" the ""upcoming reduction in force"" notices the workers had previously received. It did not explain the reason that HHS appeared to be reinstating hundreds of workers more than two months after it told many of them in another email that their jobs were ""either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.""
Ellington, the director of the group most affected by the HHS backtrack, told her staff that she herself did not know ""what factored into the decision or why certain staff received the notification,"" and advised the employees that the information might not be final.
Sponsor Message
HHS did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment regarding the reason that it revoked the employees' notices. In April, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
acknowledged
that about a fifth of the cuts at HHS
were made unintentionally
and some people would be offered their jobs back.
By May, Kennedy
announced
that 328 formerly laid off workers at another division of the CDC, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, had been reinstated.
Reactions to the news from workers at the CDC were mixed. Some scientists told NPR they would be excited to do their jobs again. Other workers said they were confused about the meaning of the emails and apprehensive about the consequences of the decision.
""I think people are very tacitly hopeful that this means they can get their jobs back and continue serving in ways that they love,"" said Kathryn Sisler, a health scientist at the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice who received the email on Wednesday. ""But there has been so much instability and chaos that I think a lot of people would hesitate to say it is good news.""
Before Sisler was laid off in April, she worked with communities in several states to help people affected by the results of climate change, like increased heat. The turmoil that HHS had caused by shuttering her department two months ago already disrupted those efforts, she said.
""Some states and localities decided to already start laying people off because they weren't sure if the grants were going to continue,"" Sisler said. ""Really just a lot of valuable data and information that was getting lost and not being utilized, especially as we look towards the heat season right now, which starts to get pretty deadly.""

Under pressure, HHS reinstates hundreds of occupational health workers
Reversing the layoffs would also bring logistical challenges for some affected employees, Sisler said. She and some other members of the division already moved away from Atlanta, where they had lived to be close to their jobs at the CDC's headquarters, she mentioned. Other employees had taken other jobs or had been offered them.
""It's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't feel like a victory that is on solid ground,"" said Sisler.
Staff at the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention confirmed that the lapse in activity while employees were not working in April and May had also caused damage in some of their labs. At least one machine would need repairs, two CDC employees told NPR, and some disease outbreaks had not been properly tracked. Since late April, without help from the CDC's hepatitis lab, health workers in Florida had not been able to confirm any additional cases as part of an ongoing hepatitis C outbreak in that state, said another worker at the CDC. The employees asked not to be identified because they said they fear retaliation.
Sponsor Message
Public health experts echoed the mixed sentiments of the employees.
""It's great to see that there is some recognition of the importance of these workers and that being in those positions is critical for the public health of America and that they are being reinstated in order to continue their important work,"" said Carmen Marsit, an environmental health researcher and professor at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.
But ""there's still a lot of people that are not being reinstated,"" he added. ""And so I think there are still concerns about what is being missed.""
Scott Becker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, a group that works closely with some of the labs that were previously shuttered, said he was ""happily flabbergasted"" to learn of the HHS emails.
""I am concerned about how many of the people have already moved on or might move on and the trauma that they really must be going through with the uncertainty,"" said Becker. ""But all in all, it's good news and I'll take it.""

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unveiled eight people he has chosen to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel – just two days after taking the unprecedented step of
removing all 17 sitting members
.
On Wednesday, Kennedy listed the names and short bios of the new advisers who will join the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, at its
upcoming meeting in late June
.

""All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense,"" Kennedy
said in a post on X
, ""They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations.""
The new members are Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln, Martin Kulldorff, Retsef Levi, Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Cody Meissner, Dr. Michael A. Ross, Dr. James Pagano and Vicky Pebsworth.
""This is a huge win for the medical freedom [m]ovement,"" David Mansdoerfer, former deputy assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services in the first Trump administration, wrote
in a post on X
, ""they did everything by the book to put together this excellent slate of appointees.""

Public health advocates are wary.
The American Medical Association ""is deeply concerned to learn that new members have already been selected for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans,"" said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, AMA president,
in a statement
.
""Kennedy did not pick people with strong, current expertise in vaccines,"" says Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law, San Francisco, who studies vaccine policy. ""It tells me that Kennedy is setting up a committee that would be skeptical of vaccines, and possibly willing to implement an anti-vaccine agenda.""
The panel of outside experts helps set vaccine policy and craft recommendations for the immunization schedule, which guides health providers and influences which shots are covered by health insurers.
The NPR Politics Podcast
RFK ousts all 17 members of a vaccine advisory panel
Kennedy's new selections have varied backgrounds, though many rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they criticized government policies on school closures and lockdowns, and the mRNA vaccines.
For example, Kulldorff, an epidemiologist and biostatistician, helped write the
Great Barrington Declaration
with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, then a Stanford University professor who is now director of the National Institutes of Health. That open letter questioned lockdowns and other public health measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Kulldorff declined to comment when reached by NPR.

Malone has gained a large following for undermining the COVID-19 vaccine. A scientist who worked on early research into the mRNA technology, he became critical of the shot and
made baseless and disproven claims,
including falsely stating that getting vaccinated puts people who have already had COVID-19 at higher risk.
Some of those selected by Kennedy hold academic appointments at well-known universities.
In fact, Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College
'
s Geisel School of Medicine, was previously a member of ACIP. A
CDC database posted in March
shows that Meissner made 12 conflict of interest disclosures during his time on the committee from 2008 to 2012. Kennedy has cited conflicts of interest as one reason for sacking the previous committee members. Meissner did not immediately return a request for comment left on his voicemail and by text.
Health
HHS head RFK Jr. is removing all members of a key CDC vaccine policy committee
Meissner was a member of the panel of Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisers that made recommendations to authorize the use of COVID vaccines. He has criticized recommendations to mask children, including in an op-ed he co-wrote with current FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, and has
indicated support
for Kennedy's recent decision to remove healthy children and pregnant women from the COVID-19 vaccine schedule.
Another member,
Vicky Pebsworth
, has served on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center — a prominent advocacy group that warns against vaccine risks.
Dr. Retsef Levi, who's at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has stoked concerns about the shots. In a social media post in
early 2023
, Levi said that all ""COVID mRNA vaccination program[s] should stop immediately…because they completely fail to fulfill any of their advertised promises regarding efficacy"" and there was ""mounting and indisputable evidence that they cause unprecedented levels of harm, including the death of young people and children.""
Kennedy's decision to replace the entire roster of the ACIP jolted the public health and medical establishment, who feared the move cleared the way for a committee that will take steps to undermine vaccine policy.
Sponsor Message
Kennedy has also changed the CDC leadership of the group.
ACIP Executive Secretary Melinda Wharton, a senior official in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, was replaced by Mina Zadeh, whose LinkedIn profile shows she led the Scheduling and Advance team --
a role
which coordinates and manages the CDC director's schedule.
An HHS spokesperson wrote that Zadeh has worked in various capacities at HHS for more than 27 years. ""Mina began her career in immunization and infectious disease research at CDC and holds a B.S. in Microbiology, an MPH from Emory, and a Ph.D. in Evaluation. She brings unparalleled experience, strategic insight, and commitment to scientific excellence to the ACIP,"" she said.
The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for June 25-27. The committee can only vote when a quorum is present, which is defined in its most recent
policies and procedures
as when ""more than half of the voting members are present.""
Kennedy has named eight members to the committee, which falls short of quorum for the committee, which is currently chartered for nineteen members, says Reiss, with UC Law, San Francisco. Therefore, at least two ex-officio members from other HHS agencies will need to be temporarily authorized to vote for the committee to proceed, she says."

Major changes could be in store for the more than 24 million people with health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, including how and when they can enroll, the paperwork required, and, crucially, the premiums they pay.
A driver behind these changes is the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" the name given to spending and tax legislation designed to advance the policy agenda of President Donald Trump. It passed the House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate.
The changes also would come from
regulations the Trump administration proposed in March
and the potential expiration of larger premium subsidies
put in place
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Millions of people might drop or lose coverage by 2034 as a result,

Here's what's in the GOP megabill that's just passed the House
Combined, the moves by Trump and his allies
could ""devastate access"" to ACA plans, said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O'Neill Institute, a health policy research group at Georgetown University.
States that run their own Obamacare marketplaces and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
have also raised concerns
about
added costs and reduced access
. But House Republicans and
some conservative think tanks
say the ACA needs revamping to rein in fraud, part of which they pin on certain Biden administration changes the measures would undo.
Senate Republicans must now weigh whether to include the House's proposals in their own bill, with the aim of getting it through the chamber by July 4.
Here are four key ways Trump's policies could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage.
Automatic re-enrollment could end
The House-passed
One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which runs more than 1,000 pages
, would create paperwork requirements that could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance.
More than 90%
of ACA enrollees receive tax credits to defray monthly premiums for their coverage. There are two key provisions for them to watch.
Shots - Health News
New studies show what's at stake if Medicaid is scaled back
One would end automatic reenrollment for most ACA policyholders each year. More than 10 million people were
automatically reenrolled
in their coverage for the 2025 plan year, with their eligibility for tax credits confirmed via a system that allows ACA marketplaces to check government or other data sources.
The House bill would instead require every new or returning policyholder each year to provide information on income, household size, immigration status, and other factors, starting in 2028. If they don't, they won't get a premium tax credit, which could put the price of coverage out of reach.
Sponsor Message
""Everyone who wants to either purchase or renew a marketplace plan will have to come with a shoebox filled with documents, scan in and upload them or mail them in, and sit and wait while someone reviews and confirms them,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
She and other policy experts fear that many consumers will become uninsured because they don't understand the requirements or find them burdensome. If too many young and healthy people, for example, decide it's not worth the hassle, that could leave more older and sicker people for ACA insurers to cover — potentially raising premiums for everyone.
But supporters of the House bill say the current approach needs changing because it is vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.
""This would ensure that enrollees need to return to the exchange to update their information and obtain an updated eligibility determination for a subsidy — best protecting the public against excess subsidies paid to insurers that can never be recovered,"" the conservative
Paragon Institute wrote
in an April letter to top Department of Health and Human Services officials.
Having a baby? Getting married? Expect coverage delays
Today, people who experience life changes — losing a job, getting married or divorced, or having a baby, for instance — are considered provisionally eligible for tax credits to reduce their premiums if they sign up or change their ACA plans. That means they would be eligible to receive these subsidies for at least 90 days while their applications are checked against government data or other sources, or marketplaces follow up with requests for additional information.
The House bill would end that, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits. That could create particular hardship for new parents, who can't confirm that babies are eligible for premium subsidies until they receive Social Security numbers weeks after they're born.
Sponsor Message
Policy experts following the debate ""did not expect the end to provisional eligibility,"" Corlette said. ""I don't know what the reaction in the Senate will be, as I'm not sure everyone understands the full implications of these provisions because they are so new.""
It can take up to six weeks for the Social Security Administration to process a number for a newborn, and an additional two weeks for parents to get the card,
according to a white paper
that analyzed provisions of the House bill and was co-authored by Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and Christen Linke Young, a visiting fellow with Brookings' Center on Health Policy.
Without a Social Security number, any application to add a newborn to an ACA policy would automatically generate a hold on premium tax credits for that family, they wrote — increasing their out-of-pocket costs, at least temporarily.
""It puts consumers on the hook for any delays the marketplace is taking,"" while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers the ACA marketplaces, ""is cutting staff and adding a lot more paperwork to burden the staff they have,"" Levitis said.
Provisions in the House bill that would require ACA enrollees to provide information each year that they reenroll — or when seeking to add or change a policy due to a life circumstance — would increase the number of people without health insurance by 700,000 in 2034, according to the latest CBO estimate.
A shorter open enrollment period
The House bill would turn into law a Trump proposal to shorten the ACA open enrollment period. The start date would continue to be Nov. 1. But the window would be shortened by about a month, with an end date of Dec. 15. This affects people in states that use the federal marketplace as well as the
19 states and the District of Columbia
that run their own, most of which offer
open enrollment into at least mid-January
.
Sponsor Message
Also, as soon as the end of this year, a special enrollment period the Biden administration created would be done away with. It allowed people with lower incomes — those who earn up to 1.5 times the 2024 federal poverty level, or about $38,730 for a family of three — to sign up anytime during the year.
Critics, including the Paragon Institute, argue that this enrollment opening led to fraud, partly blaming it for a steep increase last year in instances of insurance agents seeking commissions
by enrolling or switching consumers
into plans without their consent, or fudging their incomes to qualify them for tax credits so large they paid no monthly premiums at all.
But supporters — including some states that run their own ACA exchange — say there are other ways to address fraud.
""We anticipate that much of the improper activity can be prevented by security and integrity upgrades to the federal marketplace, which we understand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing,"" the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
wrote in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders
.
Premiums and out-of-pocket costs likely to increase
The reason? Enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic expire at the end of the year. The House bill doesn't extend them. Those more generous payments are credited with helping double ACA enrollment since 2020.
The CBO estimates that extending
the subsidies would cost $335 billion over 10 years. The House bill instead funds an extension of Trump's tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier families.
If the enhanced credits are allowed to expire, not only would premium subsidies be smaller for many people, but there would also be an abrupt eligibility cutoff — an income cliff — for households above four times the federal poverty rate,
or about $103,280 for a family of three
for this plan year.
Taking into account the smaller subsidies and the cliff,
KFF estimates a national average
premium increase of 75% for enrollees if the enhanced subsidies expire. The CBO expects that about 4.2 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 as a result.

States with permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric deaths from firearm injuries between 2011 and 2023, whereas states with stricter laws did not. That's according to a new study
published in
JAMA Pediatrics
.
""We know that the
leading cause of death in children is firearm injuries
,"" says
Dr. Maya Haasz
, an emergency medicine doctor and researcher at the University of Colorado, who wasn't involved in the new study. In a policy brief from 2021, she and her colleagues found that a child or teen is killed in the U.S.
every 2 hours and 48 minutes
.
The new study offers a window into ways to prevent these deaths, says Haasz, and she called that ""exciting.""

'Say Something' tip line in schools flags gun violence threats, study finds
""This doesn't mean we should change all our laws at once,"" Haasz says, ""but perhaps if we could look at these laws and see which ones are effective, then we could start moving towards safety.""
A pivot point in 2010
The researchers of the new study looked at firearm deaths of children 17 and under in the period after a
2010 landmark Supreme Court case
—
McDonald vs. Chicago
— ruling that said state and local governments must comply with the Second Amendment. Chicago's law banning ownership of handguns was struck down, but cities and states could still regulate guns. That led to states across the country changing their gun laws, says study author
Dr. Jeremy Faust
, an emergency medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician at
Mass General Brigham
.
""There is just this flurry of activity and it's in both directions,"" says Faust. ""You have states like Alabama or Louisiana and Texas, that are enacting much more aggressive laws in terms of freedom of access, freedom of carry laws about concealed carry in churches, laws about stand-your-ground, other things that make it just easier to get a firearm quickly and to carry.""
And states like California passed stricter gun regulations.
""Things like safety requirements, safety training requirements,"" Faust says, ""or where places instituted waiting periods or background checks to make sure that they didn't have a violent criminal offense in their recent past.""
We, The Voters
'We created this problem': a pediatric surgeon on how gun violence affects children
Faust and his colleagues grouped states into three buckets based on their gun laws: most permissive, permissive and least permissive.
Then they looked at the overall pediatric firearm deaths in the three groups from 2011 to 2023 compared to the decade prior. States with the most permissive gun laws had more than 6,000 excess deaths than they would have expected based on the earlier time period.
""We would have predicted 9,056 deaths in 13 years, when in fact, there were 15,085 deaths,"" says Faust. That's ""a 67% relative increase."" The excess deaths included both homicides and suicides.
Sponsor Message
The states in the middle group, with laws considered permissive, also saw an increase in deaths — they had 1,500 more deaths than expected.
Together, these two groups of states had more than 7,000 excess deaths of children and teens due to guns. ""And that's over 500 deaths per year,"" notes Faust.
These are children ""who should be alive. They should be around. These are not deaths that should have occurred. They are preventable.""
The study ""adds more robust evidence,"" supporting that states with more lenient gun laws have more pediatric deaths from gunshots, says
Dr. Chethan Sathya
, a pediatric surgeon and director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Northwell Health in New York. He wasn't involved in the new study.
Next steps
But states vary widely in the kinds of gun laws they have — whether they are strict or lenient, he adds. So, the next step for researchers is to look at which specific laws can really help prevent gun deaths in kids and teens.
""We really have to ask ourselves the question: What really worked in the states that had lower deaths?"" says Sathya.
For example, past studies have shown that ""child access prevention laws"" are effective in preventing injuries and deaths, notes Haasz. These are laws
that say ""it is not legal for you to allow a child to access a gun,"" she says. ""And so that might mean that you have to lock up your gun at home. That might mean that you just can't leave it on the table. And depending on the state, there's varying degrees of punishment [for breaking the law].""
""Those laws have been shown to decrease suicides and unintentional injuries in children,"" she says.
That kind of research into specific laws would help prevent not just gun deaths, notes Sathya, but also the larger number of non-fatal gunshot injuries in this age group.

""In this study, for every fatality they captured, there are going to be countless more kids in those states that had non-fatal injuries and their lives are going to forever be altered,"" Sathya says."

Salmonella — a stubborn bacterium known for its spread through contaminated food, water and even pets — is responsible for roughly 1.35 million infections in the U.S. each year. It leads the country in food poisoning-related hospitalizations and deaths, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
.
Most recently, a salmonella outbreak tied to a
California egg producer
sickened at least 79 people, as of June 6. It also triggered a recall of 1.7 million dozen eggs that may have been contaminated.

Salmonella outbreak linked to California egg distributor sickens 79 people
Despite its fishy name, salmonella has no connection to the underwater creature salmon. Rather, the story behind the bacterium is one of disputed credit between two American researchers. It's also linked to one of the most famous cases in medical history about the balance between public health and individual freedoms.
Here's a look at the origins behind the bacterium's name.
Where did 'salmonella' come from?
The bacterium is named after Daniel E. Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist from the late 19th century, according to the
Food and Drug Administration
.
While the bacterium bears his name, there is some debate over how much credit Salmon should receive over his laboratory assistant
Theobald Smith
, who many believe was the one to isolate the microorganism from sick pigs in 1885. At the time, the bacterium was referred to as ""hog-cholera bacillus"" because it was identified while researching the cause behind hog cholera.
Salmon and Smith
clashed over credit
several times, according to a biography on Salmon. Still, their collaboration led to  major advances in public health, including research that would help pave the way for the production of the polio vaccine.
In 1900, French-Argentinian bacteriologist Joseph Leon Lignières who was studying the pathogen proposed that the species of bacterium be named ""salmonella"" in honor of Salmon.

"" It's very common for species of all kinds and bacteria and basically anything in the scientific world to be named after its discoverers,"" said Jess Zafarris, an author of etymology books who writes about word origins.
Zafarris added that it was also common to add the Latin suffix ""ella"" when naming bacteria and algae. For example, ""Chlorella"" combines the Greek word ""chloro,"" meaning green, with the suffix to describe green algae. Similarly, the bacterium ""leigionella"" was named after an outbreak that occurred at an American Legion convention.
Salmonella's appearance over the centuries and 'Typhoid Mary'
While salmonella's name was coined in the 20th century, evidence suggests the bacterium itself has been infecting humans for centuries.
In 2017, scientists determined that
a deadly form of the bacteria
may have played a role in the collapse of the Aztec Empire over 500 years ago. A year later, researchers detected a strain of salmonella in an
800-year-old human skeleton
from Norway.
One of the earliest and most famous cases of a salmonella outbreak began after a woman named
Mary Mallon
moved to the U.S. from Ireland in the 1880s. Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever, and she unknowingly infected several families while working as a cook for a wealthy New York banker.

A History Of Quarantines, From Bubonic Plague To Typhoid Mary
George Soper, a sanitary expert, investigated the cases, similar to what we know today as contact tracing. It led him to believe that Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever. To be sure, at one point, Soper showed up to Mallon's work place and asked for samples of her blood, urine and stool, according to Susan Campbell Bartoletti, author of ""Terrible Typhoid Mary.""
""She grabs a carving fork and she swears and she attacks him and he fled,""
Bartoletti told NPR in 2020
.
By 1907, some 3,000 New Yorkers had been infected with salmonella typhi and Mallon was considered the key source.

Soper ultimately convinced city officials that Mallon was a public health threat, leading to her forced quarantine for over two years. After her release, new infections were traced back to Mallon, and she was permanently quarantined until her death over 20 years later.

The case of Mallon and Soper remains a powerful example in medical history of the complexities between protecting public health and preserving individual freedoms.
""When George Soper appeared in that kitchen and accused her, she was insulted. And she didn't want to lose her work, her only means of employment,"" Bartoletti said. ""Maybe he needed to explain it to her differently. Maybe he shouldn't have gone in expecting her to understand right away what he was talking about. It frightened her.""
Why is it important today?
More than a century after the major outbreak in New York, salmonella remains one of the leading causes of foodborne illness — second only to norovirus, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
.
Nearly
a quarter of salmonella infections
are caused by eating contaminated chicken and turkey. But there have also been outbreaks linked to
cucumbers
,
cantaloupe
,
pet turtles
and most recently, eggs.

How safe is the food supply after federal cutbacks? Experts are worried
These outbreaks come amid massive cuts by the Trump administration to the three federal agencies responsible for food safety oversight. That includes the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""Our federal food safety system is teetering on the brink of a collapse,"" Sarah Sorscher, a policy expert at the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
told NPR last month
.
In statements to NPR, the FDA and USDA said last month that the recent changes will not alter their commitment to food safety. The CDC also previously said it ""remains prepared to respond to, and work with states on those outbreaks."""

Fentanyl and other street drugs killed more than 230 thousand people under the age of 35 in the U-S over the last decade.
But now new federal data shows drug deaths among young people are plummeting at an unprecedented rate - saving thousands of lives each year.
What's driving the drop, and with federal funding cuts on the horizon will it continue?

For nearly 15 years, Dennis Burton worked on a project aimed at solving what he calls ""one of the most difficult problems in biomedicine"" — creating an HIV vaccine.
That work was funded by the largest National Institutes of Health-funded program devoted to such research, with a seven-year grant totaling $258 million, and is considered one of the leading vaccine efforts. On May 30, he learned that work will end. In a video call, NIH officials told him that the Trump administration was terminating the program next year.
""It's just devastating. So much human toil has gone into this,"" says the Scripps Research Institute immunologist. ""Just when it looked like we could beat this virus, we're going to give up.""
Sponsor Message
Designing an effective HIV vaccine has proven
immensely challenging
for researchers, who've spent decades working to figure out how to prompt the immune system to protect against this wily virus, says
Burton
.
One of the reasons it's so difficult is because the HIV virus evolves faster than any other known virus. Even within an infected individual, the virus can splinter off into many new variants, effectively dodging the immune system's first-responders — antibodies.
Burton and his colleagues at the
Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development
— a consortia of researchers at Scripps and Duke University known as CHAVD — have been working on a promising approach aimed at coaxing the immune system to make ""broadly neutralizing antibodies"" capable of attacking many forms of the virus. Clinical trials were slated to start as soon as next year. Without funding, they won't proceed.
""Complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts that dilute taxpayer resources,"" a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told NPR in response to a question about the rationale behind the cuts.
The news of the termination comes as the HIV vaccine has largely coalesced around the idea that broadly neutralizing antibodies are central to an effective HIV vaccine, says
Mark Feinberg
, president and CEO of IAVI, a non-profit that develops vaccines. Scripps and Duke researchers were pursuing different approaches toward that shared goal, which is good, he says. ""You don't know which is going to work and whether there's potential synergies between the two approaches.""
Sponsor Message
The Trump administration's termination of CHAVD is just the latest in a string of cuts and cancellations of HIV-vaccine related grants, from clinical trials to basic laboratory research. In 2022, the U.S. accounted for
nearly 90%
of the $731 million devoted to HIV vaccine research globally. If those funds dry up, many researchers fear that the prospects of getting an effective HIV vaccine will dwindle.
""After many years of frustration and negative results we now believe that there is a pathway to develop an efficacious HIV vaccine,"" says Feinberg. ""It's really disappointing at this time to have the foundation kicked out from underneath you.""
A canceled African trial
The NIH-funded project isn't the only vaccine research being affected by the Trump administration.
In late January, biomedical scientist
Linda-Gail Bekker
and her colleagues were gathered in Tanzania to discuss their efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines across eight African countries. That team, called
The BRILLIANT HIV vaccine consortium
had won a five-year $45 million dollar grant from USAID in 2023 and was days away from starting its first clinical trial in humans when it got a stop-work order from the U.S. government.
""To say we were disappointed is to completely underplay how we felt,"" said Bekker, of the University of Cape Town. ""We felt desperate, that something we'd been working so hard to accomplish was removed without a good reason.""
Bekker and her colleagues had spent a year assembling a team of research biologists and clinicians from around the world to develop immunogens — substances that kick start an immune response that serve as the basis for future vaccines. They looked for inspiration, in part, from HIV patients in South Africa whose bodies seem to
naturally produce
broadly neutralizing antibodies.
""The idea was to base [vaccines] on [HIV] viruses that had been discovered in Africa and immunogens designed based on those viruses as templates,"" she said. Underscoring the global nature of HIV vaccine research, scientists with the CHAVD program helped design some of the immunogens, Bekker says.
Sponsor Message
Then, the team would ""put these immunogens into humans, in clinical trials, to test whether we can actually move the human immune system to make broadly neutralizing antibodies,"" says Bekker. Those clinical trials were slated to happen in African countries where the HIV epidemic is most severe, allowing researchers to more clearly assess whether the vaccines work than if they were to test them in, say, the U.S.
Now, Bekker and her colleagues have largely stopped vaccine-related work and are instead scrambling to find alternative funds for the project.
The USAID grant is ""irreplaceable"" in terms of its scope, says Bekker. The team is now figuring out how to scale back their ambitions by running fewer, smaller clinical trials. But that means the data will be less valuable, says Bekker.
These kinds of international collaborations are commonplace in efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines, researchers told NPR — and face an uncertain future under the Trump administration.
In May, NIH announced it would
no longer fund
foreign ""subawards,"" which allow U.S. scientists to pay foreign collaborators to conduct research overseas. Last year, NIH funded more than 3,600 such awards. Instead, foreign researchers must apply directly to NIH for funding, a barrier that will likely reduce foreign collaboration, says
Susan Zolla-Pazner
, a microbiologist at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
""Foreign partners in HIV research are extremely important,"" she says. ""It's a global disease and viruses don't recognize national boundaries."" For example, if a researcher wanted to study how to prevent babies from being infected by their HIV-positive mothers, the best thing to do is conduct the study in a place where such mothers exist in sufficient numbers, which is outside of the U.S. says Zolla-Pazner. If you can't do that, ""it's more than a hurdle. It's a brick wall in terms of being able to understand how to protect a population of women and their children.""
Sponsor Message
On top of these restrictions, researchers worry generally about the prospect of getting vaccine-related grants accepted in the current climate. NIH has already cancelled or delayed payments on over 2,500 individual grants, including some related to HIV vaccine research, and under the Trump administration has
signaled a shift away
from mRNA vaccine research — the same platform that allowed rapid development of the first COVID-19 vaccines.
Pessimism — and yet hope
Altogether, the administration's actions — and
pledges to cut funding
for NIH grants by more than 40% next year — have many researchers pessimistic about the prospects of developing an HIV vaccine anytime soon.
""My personal view is that advances will stall out,"" says Burton, the Scripps scientist. ""The United States led the world in HIV vaccine research, I don't think that anyone's going to step into the breach,"" he says. ""Philanthropy can certainly help, but they're unlikely to step in with the magnitude of funding needed.""
Even if funding eventually comes back, from the U.S. or elsewhere, it can be difficult for research groups to bounce back from extended cuts.
""It is putting a period in the middle of a sentence,"" says Zolla-Pazner. ""You cannot reconstitute that group, even two months later, because people have lost their jobs.""
Other researchers are hopeful the field will eventually build on the progress already made to deliver an HIV vaccine.
""It remains a huge challenge, but we now have little chinks of light of how to move this field forward,"" says Bekker. ""I believe we will get back on track, but we will have lost time,"" she says. ""And that means people's lives.""

Roughly 163 million people experience obsessive-compulsive disorder and its associated cycles of obsessions and compulsions. They have unwanted intrusive thoughts, images or urges; they also do certain behaviors to decrease the distress caused by these thoughts.
In movies and TV shows, characters with OCD are often depicted washing their hands or obsessing about symmetry.
Carolyn Rodriguez
is a physician at Stanford studying OCD and the director of the
Stanford OCD Research Lab
. She says these are often symptoms of OCD, but they're not the only ways it manifests – and there's still a lot of basics we have yet to understand about it.
Sponsor Message
In her time practicing medicine, she's seen many permutations of the condition, and has realized how often people with OCD, and even mental health care providers, may not recognize the symptoms. Once patients are diagnosed, some won't respond to treatments like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or exposure and response prevention. That's why, in this encore episode, Rodriguez looks to include more populations in research and find new ways to treat OCD, like ketamine.

PHILADELPHIA — When Justin Carlyle, 23, began experimenting with drugs a decade ago, he found himself part of a generation of young Americans caught in the devastating wave of harm caused by fentanyl addiction and overdose.
""I use fentanyl, cocaine, crack cocaine, yeah, all of it,"" Carlyle said, speaking to NPR on the streets of Kensington, a working class neighborhood in Philadelphia where dealers sell drugs openly. ""I was real young. I was 13 or 14 when I tried cocaine, crack cocaine, for the first time.""
As an elevated train rumbled overhead, Carlyle described turning to fentanyl, xylazine and other increasingly toxic street drugs. ""I've had three overdoses, and two of the times I was definitely Narcaned,"" he said, referring to a medication, also known as naloxone, that reverses potentially fatal opioid overdoses.
Sponsor Message
Carlyle's teens and early 20s have been wracked by severe drug use, but the fact that he's still alive means he's part of a hopeful new national trend.
""What we're seeing is a massive reduction in [fatal] overdose risk, among Gen Z in particular,"" said Nabarun Dasgupta, an addiction researcher at the University of North Carolina. ""Ages 20 to 29 lowered the risk by 47%, cut it right in half.""
This stunning drop in drug deaths among people in the U.S.
is being tracked in
data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies.
The latest available records found fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people (see chart) under the age of 35 in 2021. By last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses, according to provisional CDC data.

The lifesaving shift is welcome news for parents like Jon Epstein, who lost his son Cal to fentanyl in 2020. ""What has happened with the 20- to 29-year-olds?  They beat fentanyl,"" said Epstein, who works with
a national drug awareness group focused on young people called Song for Charlie
.
Cal Epstein (right) died from a fentanyl overdose in 2020 when he was 18.

For America's young, a decade of unprecedented carnage
To understand the significance of this promising trend, it's important to recall the terror and devastation wrought by fentanyl among families and communities in the U.S.
Beginning around 2014,
U.S. officials say Mexican drug cartels began smuggling large quantities of fentanyl into American communities
, often disguising the street drug as counterfeit prescription pills resembling OxyContin or Percocet.
Over the past decade, drug overdoses among young people surged, killing more than 230,000 people under the age of 35. For many families and whole communities, the losses felt catastrophic.
""We went to check on [Cal] and he was unresponsive,"" Jon Epstein recalled. ""We made it to the hospital, but he didn't make it home. It was a bolt out of the blue.""

Cal Epstein was 18, a college student. According to the family, it's not clear why he decided to take an opioid pill. He tried to purchase a prescription-grade pill from a dealer on social media. In fact, it was a counterfeit pill containing a deadly dose of fentanyl.

While grieving, Jon Epstein started learning about fentanyl, digging through public health data. He found other kids in his town of Beaverton, Ore., were dying. ""They had lost four students [to fatal overdoses in the local school district] in the preceding year,"" he recalled.
Jon and his wife, Jennifer Epstein, connected with a growing network of shattered parents around the country who were waking up to a terrifying fact: Fentanyl, often sold on social media platforms, was making it into their homes and killing their kids.
Like many grieving families, they turned their sorrow into activism. Through the group Song for Charlie, they worked to educate young people and parents about the unique dangers of fentanyl.
""The game has completely changed, especially for kids who are going through an experimental phase,"" Jon Epstein warned in a video distributed nationally. ""An experimental phase is now deadly."" This message — summed up by the phrase
One pill can kill
—  began spreading in schools and on social media nationwide but for years the wave of death seemed unsolvable.
In a
study published last month in the journal
Pediatrics
, researcher Noa Krawczyk at the NYU Grossman School of Public Health found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl ""nearly quadrupled"" among people people age 15 to 24 from 2018 through 2022.
""In your generation, people used drugs. In my generation people used drugs, we just didn't use to die as much from them,"" Krawczyk said.
Especially among teenagers in the U.S., fentanyl deaths seemed stuck at catastrophic levels, between 1,500 and 2,000 fatal overdoses a year. Then last year, federal data revealed a stunning decline, with 40% fewer teens experiencing fatal overdoses. ""We're super heartened to finally see teens dropping,"" Epstein said.
While the improvement is dramatic, Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, found the recovery among teens appears uneven.
Some teens and 20-somethings are seeing far fewer deaths, but he identified one cluster born between 2005 and 2011 who actually saw a slight uptick in deaths over the past two years. The increase is relatively small — about 300 additional fatalities nationwide over two years — but Dasgupta said it's an area of concern that needs more study to determine why.
Sponsor Message
The question now is what changed that is suddenly saving so many young lives?  Drug policy experts are scrambling to understand the shift.
Many U.S. kids appear more cautious about drug use
Theories include the wider distribution of Narcan, or naloxone; a trend of weaker, less deadly fentanyl being sold by dealers; more readily available addiction healthcare; and also the loss of so many vulnerable young people who have already died.
National
Deadliest phase of fentanyl crisis eases, as all states see recovery
Many researchers believe another key factor may be less risky drug and alcohol use among teens and twenty-somethings, a pattern that emerged during the years of the COVID epidemic.
One study by a team at the University of Michigan
found the number of teens abstaining from substance grew to its highest level in 2024.
""This trend in the reduction of substance use among teenagers is unprecedented,"" Nora D. Volkow, who has served as director of the U.S. government's National Institute on Drug Abuse since 2003, said
in a statement last December.
Keith Humphreys, an addiction researcher at Stanford University, credits this apparent behavioral shift with helping save lives. ""There's fewer people initiating with these substances. That should work in our favor,"" he told NPR.
According to Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, years of devastation caused by fentanyl and other opioids might mean more people in their teens and twenties are choosing to experiment with less risky drugs.
""Alcohol and opioids are on the outs with Gen Z, and instead we see [a shift to] cannabis and psychedelics, and those are inherently safer drugs,"" he said.
Overall, this positive trend among younger Americans is outpacing the wider opioid recovery in the U.S., which saw 27% fewer fatal overdoses across all age groups in 2024.
The Story Behind The Story
8 theories why fentanyl deaths are plummeting
Will drug deaths keep dropping for young Americans?
While this news is promising — roughly 15,000 fewer drug deaths among young people in the U.S. in 2024, according to preliminary data, compared with the deadliest year 2021 — researchers say sustaining progress may be difficult.
That's because many of the young people still most at risk, like Justin Carlyle in Philadelphia, aren't just experimenting with drugs. They're struggling with full blown addiction.
""What I'm used to is getting high, you know?"" he said.
Despite the danger of a fatal overdose, Carlyle told NPR he has tried to quit fentanyl repeatedly, even using the medication suboxone to to try to curb his opioid cravings, so far without success.
Sponsor Message
""I wish I had the answer to that. I know all of us fighting addiction right now wish we had the answer,"" he said.
But many experts, activists and front-line healthcare workers say there's more hope on the streets, too. The spread of Narcan
is helping. Researchers studying street drugs say the fentanyl being sold by dealers in the U.S. is less potent, less deadly, than it once was.

Trump team revokes $11 billion in funding for addiction, mental health care
That matters because studies show people who survive addiction long enough do typically recover.
There are also growing efforts around the U.S. aimed at reaching young people experiencing severe addiction, programs that ramped up over the past four years with federal funding from the Biden administration.
On a recent afternoon, two city drug response workers in Philadelphia, Kevin Howard and Dominick Maurizio, offered counseling to a young man huddled in a bus shelter.
""Anything we can help you with? Want to go in-patient?"" Howard said. ""Want to go to a shelter?""

Howard and Maurizio are themselves in recovery after surviving what they describe as their own battles with heroin and crack cocaine addiction when they were young men in their 20s.
Both said they believe this kind of outreach is helping. ""If we help one person, we're winning in some capacity,"" Maurizio said.
""I see it as me saving lives,"" Howard said. ""Any time I give someone Narcan or just check on them to see if they're alive, I believe we're winning.""
But experts point to one other uncertainty in this first hopeful moment since the fentanyl crisis began.
The Trump administration wants to cut billions of dollars in funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis. The federal government has already moved to freeze or end grants that support front-line drug treatment and harm reduction programs.

Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is removing all 17 members of a key advisory committee that helps craft vaccine policy and recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kennedy made the announcement on Monday afternoon in a press release from the Department of Health and Human Services and an opinion piece published by
The Wall Street Journal
.
In his role as head of HHS, Kennedy has the legal authority to replace members of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
, but the decision to scrap the entire committee flies in the face of precedent and has alarmed the public health and medical establishment.

""A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,"" Kennedy said in a statement, ""ACIP new members will prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine. The Committee will no longer function as a rubber stamp for industry profit-taking agendas.""
Medical groups were quick to issue statements denouncing the move.

RFK says most vaccine advisers have conflicts of interest. A report shows they don't
The American Medical Association said Kennedy's decision undermines ""trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives."" The president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America called the allegation about the integrity of the committee ""completely unfounded.""
Kennedy has previously claimed that ACIP members have serious conflicts of interests.
However,
as NPR has reported
,
a government report he has cited to back that up shows they do not. In addition, committee members are required to disclose if they have any conflicts of interest before casting a vote and recuse themselves if they have one.
Past members of ACIP warn that gutting the current committee removes an important check on changes in the administration's approach to vaccine policy.
Dr. Jonathan Temte
, who served as chair from 2012 to 2015, told NPR that ""across the entire world, ACIP has been the paragon of solid, well thought out, evidence-based vaccine policy.""
""I hate to say this, but we are heading in the direction of U.S. vaccine policy becoming the laughing stock of the globe,"" said Temte, a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin.

Given Kennedy's history of
leading an anti-vaccine advocacy group
, public health experts and
members of Congress
have worried about
what could happen
to the committee under Kennedy's watch.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican representing Louisiana, cast a critical vote to advance Kennedy's nomination, saying he had assurances that Kennedy would maintain ACIP's recommendations ""without changes.""
It's not yet clear who Kennedy will tap to fill the now-vacant seats on the committee, though he said new members are already under consideration.

We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.""
The document is notable because most NIH employees are afraid to publicly criticize the new administration publicly for fear of losing their jobs or their funding — a situation the declaration calls a ""culture of fear and suppression."" The document was signed by 92 employees who revealed their names.
""Standing up in this way is a risk, but I am much more worried about the risks of not speaking up,"" said a statement by Jenna Norton, one of the lead organizers of the declaration and a program officer at the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""If we don't speak up, we allow continued harm to research participants and public health in America and across the globe. If we don't speak up, we allow our government to curtail free speech, a fundamental American value.""

In a written response, Bhattacharya said the Bethesda Declaration ""has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.""
But some of the scientists who signed the letter described a sense of despair and anguish at the NIH, which is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research.
""It's a horror show. We're under attack in every way all the time,"" says
Sarah Kobrin
, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for more than 21 years. ""We're told we're worthless. We're told we're cheats. This is probably the most stressful period of my entire life. It's a thousand cuts, a thousand cuts. They're breaking things that won't be repairable.""
Kobrin, chief of NCI's Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, stresses that she was speaking on her own behalf and not as part of the NIH.
""This is an extinction-level event for biomedical research and global public health, and it's just wrong not to say something and not to try to right this ship,"" says
Ian Morgan
, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine.
More than 40 scientists from outside the NIH, including 21 Nobel laureates, also initially signed a
separate letter
supporting the Bethesda Declaration. In addition, more than 500 signed the letter Monday morning after the document was made public.
""We commend the NIH staff who have come forward with the 'Bethesda Declaration' to share concerns in the spirit of academic freedom, for the good of all,"" the letter states.
""We urge NIH and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership to work with NIH staff to return the NIH to its mission and to abandon the strategy of using NIH as a tool for achieving political goals unrelated to that mission.""

Former NIH researcher

""And I think they're very brave to stand up for themselves and for many many many of their colleagues at NIH and for themselves and for the entire country.""
Berg, who signed the open letter supporting the Bethesda Declaration, stresses that he's speaking on behalf of himself and not the University of Pittsburgh, where he now works.
""Horror show doesn't even come close actually"" to describing the situation,"" Berg said. ""It's tremendously damaging to the United States' ability to do research, the U.S. economy, our competitive position in the world.""

The device itself is small, but the hype around it is big.
Continuous glucose monitors are only about the size of a
quarter, but the companies that sell them make huge claims about their health benefits: You can ""
revolutionize your health
,"" one company says.
President Trump's nominee for
surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means
, is a prominent proponent of continuous glucose monitoring. She
co-founded a company
that distributes the devices and sells an app to help people use them.

Shots - Health News
In 'Good Energy,' a doctor lays out how to measure and boost your metabolic health
The monitor is a painless patch that inserts a needle into your skin. Every few minutes or so, it sends a signal to an app on your phone with an estimate of your blood sugar. (It measures the sugar concentration between your skin cells, which roughly correlates with your blood sugar level.) The app also helps you keep a log of everything you eat, so that you can track how different foods impact your blood sugar.
Studies have found that this technology has transformed care for people with diabetes. ""It has revolutionized their and their families' lives,"" says
Elizabeth Selvin
, who researches diabetes at Johns Hopkins University.
But in March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration
approved the first
continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Currently, two companies are making them:
Dexcom
and
Abbott
. Each patch lasts about two weeks and costs about $50, so tracking your blood sugar for an extended period of time costs about $100 each month.
The critical question is: Do they actually help people
without
diabetes or prediabetes improve their health?
Lily Padula for NPR/‎‎ㅤㅤㅤ
The theory
After you eat a meal that contains carbohydrates, a healthy person's blood sugar rises, peaks and then gently falls back to baseline.
""These peaks and troughs are the normal physiological response to consuming carbohydrates, in people without diabetes,"" says nutritionist
Sarah Berry
, a professor of nutrition at King's College London. Berry is also
chief scientist at Zoe
, a company that distributes continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and an app to interpret the data. ""We do not need to flatten these curves,"" she says.
Sponsor Message
But problems can arise when these peaks become too frequent and too high, Berry says. That could put you at a higher risk of
obesity
,
cancer
,
cardiovascular disease
and
Type 2 diabetes
, studies show. It can also make you hungrier between meals, Berry says, so you'll eat more at the next meal.
The idea behind glucose monitoring is that it could help you identify specific meals or meal sizes that produce extreme peaks. Then if you modify the meal, that shift could help you lose weight, reduce your risk of diabetes or simply help you feel better.
The findings
Two major studies have tested this theory with randomized control trials. In the studies, people wore a glucose monitoring patch for a period of time while they tracked what they ate on an app. Researchers used the data to design a personalized diet aimed at lowering blood sugar. Then the scientists tested how well this CGM-based diet stacked up against a standard low-fat or Mediterranean diet.
At a population level, the
findings have been mixed
. In one study at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the CGM-based diet didn't help people lose more weight than simply following the Mediterranean diet. However, it did help them lower their blood sugar more,
scientists reported
in the journal
Diabetes Care
.
The second study compared the CGM-based diet to a low-fat, high-whole-grain diet. On average, both diets led to the same amount of weight loss and small improvements in blood sugar, researchers at New York University
reported in the journal
JAMA Network Open
and
The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
. But
Collin Popp,
who helped lead this study, said the overall findings don't tell the whole story. These conclusions show only the average response across the whole population, Popp says.
""When you look at the individual level, it's very different,"" he says. For some people, the glucose-monitoring approach helped tremendously. Some people lost a large amount of weight. ""We had individuals coming back and saying, 'You changed my life. I lost 30 pounds and I feel great.' Other people in the study put on weight.""

So now scientists are trying to figure out who benefits from this technology.
Lily Padula for NPR‎/‎‎
When glucose monitors might be useful
1. If you're highly sensitive to carbohydrates
Nutritionist
Karen Kennedy
has been helping people interpret and understand their glucose-monitoring data for five years. In her experience, these devices help some people discover a heightened sensitivity to carbohydrates, even to healthy versions, such as whole grains.
""They eat brown rice, quinoa, beans, rice or oatmeal, and their blood glucose consistently goes really high,"" she says.
The monitor helps them realize that they'll manage their blood sugar better on a low-carb diet. ""Not zero carbohydrates, but lower carbohydrates,"" Kennedy says.
""They change their diets, and then their blood sugar comes down dramatically,"" Kennedy says. ""If they can keep up that new diet, they feel better and
lose visceral fat
.""
2. If you need extra motivation to eat healthier foods
Many people already know what they need to do to improve their metabolic health. But putting this advice into practice — that's hard, both Kennedy and NYU's Popp say.
The quick feedback from a continuous glucose monitor may give them a nudge to actually implement nutritional advice. ""It's a motivator,"" Popp says.
For example, one of Kennedy's clients clearly needed to add more protein and fat to their breakfast.
""They were like, 'Sorry, but this is my breakfast, and it has worked for me for 30 years.'""
Shots - Health News
Less snacking, more satisfaction: Some foods boost levels of an Ozempic-like hormone
Then the client wore a patch for a week and saw how that breakfast shot their blood sugar super-high. They immediately changed their breakfast, Kennedy says. Right away, the client could see how this new breakfast improved their blood sugar levels.
""They didn't have to wait a few months and go to the doctor to see it working,"" she says. ""That agency can be motivating.""
3. If you need more awareness about your diet
In the study at NYU, some people greatly benefited from the CGM-based diet. When Popp and his colleague dug into their data deeper, they found one key factor for this success: whether the person
consistently logged their meals
into the device's app over the six-month experiment.
Sponsor Message
For some people, simply documenting what they ate helped them improve their diet and their blood sugar levels, Popp says. ""I tell people all the time, 'Monitoring what you do can play a huge role in your health.'
""And you don't need to log the food accurately,"" he adds. ""It's the mere act of documenting it that's important for most people.""
The Salt
Resolved To Lose Weight? We Gave Food-Tracking Apps A Try
""We know that awareness helps people lose weight,"" adds Johns Hopkins' Selvin. ""And it doesn't have to be with an app. I have a colleague who uses a little pocket notepad. It adds accountability"" — and it's cheaper than glucose monitoring.
Before you decide to buy the device, experts say, be aware:
Many people find the data confusing and unhelpful.
""Many people come to me and say, 'I have been using the device for three or even 12 months, and I have all this data, but I don't know what it means. I don't know how to lower my blood sugar or improve it,'"" Kennedy says.
People really need to be educated about what the data means, Popp agrees. But that education will go only so far because at this point, some of the data is still mysterious to scientists and doctors.
If you're staying within a normal range, say about 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL, scientists still don't understand what the peaks and troughs mean.
""There's no real standard guidelines about what's a good peak or a bad peak in nondiabetics,"" Popp says.
The data can be misleading.
First off, the devices aren't super precise or accurate, and our bodies don't always respond the same way to the same food.
One recent study
in
The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
found that the same meal on two different days gave very different readings.
Another small study
, in the same journal, found that the continuous glucose monitor overestimated people's blood sugar levels compared with directly measuring it in the blood.
Sponsor Message
Second, the data can make people worry about — or even stop — eating healthy foods that cause normal blood sugar fluctuations. For example, Popp has a friend who started to worry about blueberries because they made her blood sugar rise slightly and then decline.
""You don't want to start tagging foods as 'unhealthy' just because it led to what I perceived as a minuscule blood sugar spike.""
Third, some people can have what looks like normal blood sugar levels but still have insulin resistance, Kennedy explains. In this case, their bodies compensate by overproducing insulin. To figure this out, you would need to see a doctor and have your insulin levels checked.

In late 2019, a team of researchers launched
The Dog Aging Project
, a long-term survey on the health and lifestyles of dogs in the United States. Their launch goal: Enroll 10,000 dogs. When a global pandemic hit soon after, it was suddenly a daunting task.
But it turned out that people were eager to sign up, since many of them were spending lots of time at home with their dogs.
Today, The Dog Aging Project has more than 50,000 companion dogs enrolled. Project scientists collect all sorts of data about them: their diet, exercise level, medications, demographics and environmental exposures.

Through the project, scientists like Virginia Tech veterinarian and data analyst
Audrey Ruple
hope to better understand what contributes to dog aging, how to ameliorate its effects and how to leverage the knowledge they gain into insights about human health and aging.
""Ultimately, I would really like to know what the right recipe is for a long, healthy life for our dog companions,"" says Ruple. ""What are the things that we can do to optimize health within that species? I do think that learning those keys in the dog population will help us in terms of figuring out what's the right combination of things for the human population as well.""

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. often says that Americans were healthier when he was a kid in the '50s and '60s. People weren't so overweight or taking so many medications. Diabetes and autism in children were unheard of. Food was fresh and wholesome.
Life expectancy researcher
Dr. Steven Woolf
is Kennedy's age, and he remembers some other features of that time. ""We were driven around in cars that had no seatbelts. There were no infant car seats; there were no airbags,"" he says. ""People smoked on airplanes; they smoked in restaurants.""

Public Health
With CDC injury prevention team gutted, 'we will not know what is killing us'
Woolf, who is a professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University, says some concerns that Kennedy talks about when he discusses America's health are spot on, but that he misses key context, gets facts wrong and often embraces policies that undermine his own stated priorities.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's detailed request to comment for this story.
Setting the scene
The mid-20th century is the era that Kennedy and President Trump nod to with the ""again"" of the Make America Great (and Healthy) Again slogans.
""There is some basis to the fact that America was healthier then,"" acknowledges
Natalia Mehlman Petrzela
, a history professor at the New School in New York. ""Americans today have much more chronic illness than they did when he was a kid, and there's much more processed food today; rates of obesity are very high.""
But, she says, ""there's also some countervailing evidence that really punctures the fantasy that this was an era of much more widespread health.""
To begin with, American life expectancy
in 1960
was almost ten years shorter than it is today: 69.7 years. And the leading causes of death were, in fact, chronic diseases.

In 1963, for example, ""two out of three deaths in the United States were caused by three chronic diseases: heart disease, cancer and stroke,"" Woolf says. ""So it's hardly the case that chronic disease was a non-issue when he was a child.""
Other key context: Health insurance was a
relatively new invention
, women were just starting to become a
major part of the workforce
and racial segregation was
still a reality
in much of the country. For Black Americans, life expectancy was significantly shorter
in 1960
at just 63.6 years.

Space-age food
Then, there's food. Although processed foods were not nearly as prevalent as they are today, Petrzela says frozen and shelf-stable foods were also imbued with the romance of science and technology.

""This is a time when everybody had freezers and refrigerators for the first time, so it was almost a flex to be able to serve those foods,"" she says. Jell-O went mainstream, and the orange drink mix Tang and early energy bars came into being in this era. ""Those all came from the fact that like, 'Oh, this is what they eat in space.' Right? 'This is made in a lab.'""
YouTube
Working it out
The strongest basis for Kennedy's nostalgia is the country's push around physical education programs in that period, says Petrzela, who wrote the book,
Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America's Exercise Obsession.
Even before John F. Kennedy was sworn in, he wrote a
Sports Illustrated cover story
as president-elect in 1960 calling for Americans to toughen up.
""Our growing softness, our increasing lack of physical fitness, is a menace to our security,"" he wrote. ""The physical fitness of our citizens is a vital prerequisite to America's realization of its full potential as a nation, and to the opportunity of each individual citizen to make full and fruitful use of his capacities.""

As president, he helped advance a sensibility that ""exercise is virtuous and good and makes you a good American,"" says Petrzela.
It's worth pointing out, though, that Secretary Kennedy's strategies are at odds with other major priorities of his uncle as president. ""JFK loved P.E. and push ups and sit ups and all that — he also loved vaccines,"" she says. ""Remember, these are the presidencies of JFK and Lyndon Johnson — this is the Great Society,"" which was all about new, big government policy programs that hoped to address poverty, advance civil rights and more.

What's happened since then?
Today, American life expectancy is
77.5 years
. That's improved significantly since the 1960s, but not
as much or as quickly
as it has in other similar wealthy countries.
First, let's consider the reasons for the improvements. The lack of seat belts and smoking indoors that Woolf remembers from his childhood? Public health efforts and new laws helped make significant progress there — people who would have died of lung cancer or in car crashes were saved because of those changes.
Black Americans have also made gains in life expectancy, although racial gaps remain — the current life expectancy for this group is
72.8 years
. ""The place where we have made maybe the most obvious progress in health since 1960 has been that the conditions of Black Americans were radically improved by the health reforms that came out of the civil rights movement,"" says
Elizabeth Wrigley-Field
, a mortality demographer at the University of Minnesota.

There have also been major medical innovations, especially with cancer. ""We have new drugs and medical technologies that have been very, very effective and successful,"" Wrigley-Field explains, adding, ""you would hope that that would be true in 60 years of medical progress.""
While chronic diseases are a bigger problem now, that's a trend that has been underway for more than a century, before and after Secretary Kennedy's uncle was president, Woolf says. ""Earlier in the 1900s, the leading causes of death were infectious diseases, but as we developed antibiotics and vaccines, infectious diseases became less of a threat, and chronic diseases rose in importance,"" he explains.
RFK Jr.'s approach to these problems
Many people who study America's relatively short life expectancy compared to other developed nations are baffled by Kennedy's policy approach to the problem.
""Sometimes, he says sentences that make sense, like, 'We have a rise in chronic diseases,'"" says Wrigley-Field. But the ""funhouse mirror aspect,"" she says, is that ""all the things that you should do because of that are the exact opposite of what his administration is doing to public health.""

For instance, Kennedy's biggest move as secretary so far has been to reduce the federal health workforce by about 25%, through
firings and buyouts
. In a
social media video
announcing his plans to restructure the agency, he implied America's poor health and life expectancy could be attributed to the very staff he oversees: ""The rate of chronic disease and cancer increased dramatically as our department has grown — our lifespan has dropped.""
Woolf says that connection doesn't make sense, especially when you consider some of the expertise Kennedy is letting walk out the door. ""The main office in our federal government for dealing with smoking and health is being closed by Kennedy,"" Woolf says, noting that smoking is still the
leading preventable cause of death
in the U.S.
Sponsor Message
He adds that at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""major centers on chronic disease itself are being closed."" And at the National Institutes for Health, ""a large portion of the research portfolio aiming to address how to reduce the burden of chronic disease — the funding for that is being slashed."" HHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment about cuts to teams that seem relevant to Kennedy's priorities.
It's hard to square those cuts with ""a policy agenda that's really aiming to make America healthier,"" Woolf adds. ""Fixing the problem with ultra processed foods and
food dyes
is going to have marginal benefit. Is it worth doing? Sure. But that's not going to move the needle on improving chronic disease or extending our life expectancy.""
Public Health
RFK Jr. wants the food industry to stop using synthetic dyes
Wrigley-Field adds that really understanding and addressing the reasons for the U.S.'s lagging life expectancy is a lively scientific conversation. ""Some of the debates are about: How much of this is really a story about external causes of death — drug overdoses, homicides, car collisions? Those things all have a really disproportionate impact on life expectancy because they tend to kill people when they're pretty young, where if they hadn't died, they would have had a lot of decades of life left.""
Increasingly, she says, there's an understanding that another contributing factor is slowed scientific progress in reducing deaths from heart attacks and heart disease ""that are such major killers in the United States.""
That debate is somewhat moot when both funding for
scientific research
and for preventing
deaths from injuries
and
overdoses
are being cut by Secretary Kennedy in his overhaul of HHS. That's why his discussion about returning to the good health of the 1960s and improving life expectancy are unconvincing to many experts in the field.
For Wrigley-Field, ""there's just this mismatch between the words and the actions."""

The Queen's Gambit
came out the year the pandemic started, and with more leisure time, people began playing on streaming platforms like
chess.com
and on YouTube. India has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the boom.
The country has 85 grandmasters — an elite group of chess players — and some of the youngest top-rankers in the world. Last year, both of its men's and women's teams swept the Chess Olympiad — the Olympics of chess — held in Budapest, Hungary. At the World Chess Championship in Singapore, held in December, Indian national Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever world champion at age 18.

But some chess watchers say there's a major obstacle to India becoming the world's unchallenged chess power: the English language. Most chess books, software and classes are in English. The government's 2011 population census found that a little more than 10% of Indians fluently speak the language. Most English-speakers in India are from the country's country's middle and upper classes.

Two years ago, Venkatesh Enumalai founded the
Tamil Chess Channel
on YouTube. It teaches the basics of chess in Tamil, a language spoken by some 80 million Indians, concentrated in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The channel has more than 80,000 followers and millions of views, including among Tamil-speakers in Sri Lanka and the United States. One of his students there, he says, became a state champion in Illinois recently.

Buoyed by such success stories, Enumalai quit his day job with the sales team of a pharma company and started a chess club in Chennai, offering coaching at a little over $10 a month so even poorer children can afford it. He says he intends to travel and conduct chess boot-camps for students in the rural parts.
As the world's most populous country, India has the numbers on its side. Enumalai says it just needs a nudge to become a chess powerhouse. ""If we can nurture so many people at the bottom level, maybe we will be able to become a number one nation."""

In November 1990, more than 3,000 women descended on the sleepy beach town of San Bernardo del Tuyú, Argentina, for what was becoming a legendary event.
Activists, doctors, academics, social workers and lawyers from across the Americas traveled all the way to attend a feminist gathering known as an
Encuentro
.
While they publicly debated their political demands, the piece of information that made the biggest impact on the future of abortion was exchanged in private, in whispers.

Alicia Cacopardo, an OB-GYN from Buenos Aires, was part of those whispers. In between sessions, she fell into conversation with a group of Brazilian women in the hallway, who talked about a pill she had never heard of before: Cytotec, the commercial name of misoprostol. The drug was designed to treat stomach ulcers, but women in Brazil were using it for safe, at-home abortions.
Though Cacopardo was an expert in reproductive health, she was stunned — you can have an abortion on your own, just by taking a pill?
""It's a huge change. It's brilliant,"" she remembers thinking at the time.

The Network: Breaking Bread
In the years to come,
other abortion-rights activists across the region were thrilled when they learned about misoprostol
, and, like Cacopardo did, wanted to spread the word to other women.
Activists connected the dots: If women could get their hands on misoprostol, they could end their pregnancies despite the severe legal restrictions on abortion most Latin American countries had. With this new pill, they wouldn't have to wait for the law to change.
Word spreads

When Cacopardo returned to Buenos Aires after the
Encuentro
, she wanted to get her patients Cytotec. If she succeeded, women could end their pregnancies despite legal restrictions on abortion. At the time, Argentina only allowed abortion in cases of rape or when the mother's life was at risk.
Sponsor Message
But Cacopardo ran into a problem: Cytotec wasn't available in Argentina.
She flipped through a pharmaceutical directory and looked for any drugs that contained misoprostol, the generic name of Cytotec. She only found one medication in Argentina: Oxaprost. But Oxaprost included a second substance, called diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug typically used to treat arthritis and other problems.
So Cacopardo came up with a solution — one that required her patients to do a makeshift science project at home. Cacopardo told them to buy Oxaprost at the pharmacy and then crush the pills to separate the outer layer of misoprostol from diclofenac, which was contained in an inner layer. Cacopardo wanted her patients to avoid any potential side effects from taking too much diclofenac, such as heartburn and other stomach issues.

It was difficult to crush the pills, so some women just took the whole thing — an indication of just how DIY it was at first to self-manage an abortion with pills. Cacopardo says that none of her patients reported any serious side effects and most of them had complete abortions.
A scientific stamp of approval
Kelly Blanchard, the president of the research and advocacy organization Ibis Reproductive Health, says that experiments with misoprostol in the 1990s represented activists doing ""research in real time.""
""In the clinic setting, those innovations often come from health care providers,"" she explains. ""The activists are doing exactly the same thing: thinking about and working with people who need the care and seeing what works and what doesn't.""
Researchers like Blanchard eventually ran studies on women using misoprostol to end pregnancies, gathering evidence from all around the world — from Peru to India to South Africa. Again and again, the researchers found the same thing: Misoprostol was a safe and effective way to have an abortion outside the formal health care setting.
Sponsor Message
The studies conducted by these researchers also persuaded major public health institutions like the World Health Organization (WHO). As early as 2003, the WHO included misoprostol as a safe abortion method in the first trimester (in combination with another pill called mifepristone).
The WHO's stamp of approval didn't change the fact that abortion was illegal in many parts of the world. So activists had a problem: They knew of an effective method to have abortions outside of the medical system, but how could they get more women access to something that was illegal?

The statue of a virgin,
la Virgen del Panecillo
, looms over the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador. She has wings, like an angel.
One day in 2008, Ecuadorian activists and a group of European activists from the abortion access organization Women on Waves hung a big white banner on the balcony of the virgin statue.
The banner read ""SAFE ABORTION"" in Spanish, with a phone number. That number was for the first abortion hotline in Latin America.
Later that day, that cellphone number blew up with dozens of text messages and calls.
The idea for a hotline — and the stunt promoting it — threw these abortion activists into a new, more public era. They reached thousands of women this way with work that was bold, organized and replicable.
In 2009, a year after the Ecuador hotline launched, Argentina got its own.
The collective
Lesbianas y Feministas por la Descriminalización del Aborto
(Lesbians and Feminists for Abortion Decriminalization) started the hotline with a dozen volunteers.
""In the beginning, the hotline was so bare bones,"" says Ana Mines, one of the first hotline volunteers. The group boasted a backpack they passed around to one another, with a Nokia 1100, a notebook and flash cards.
They were short on resources, but they were determined to give rigorous information on how to use misoprostol to have safe abortions. And they advertised the helpline everywhere they could, putting up posters all over Buenos Aires with their phone number and talking about it on TV and the radio.
Sponsor Message
The helpline volunteers referred to the guidelines developed by global and regional scientific bodies, such as the WHO. This research gave the activists credibility. They thought it also gave them a legal defense: They were just sharing publicly available information.
The volunteers delivered this disclaimer to callers — that they were not doctors but were providing public information — before offering step-by-step instructions on how to use misoprostol. They answered the callers' questions, such as: If I'm overweight, will the pills work? Can the pills fall out of my vagina? Will hospital staff be able to tell that I took misoprostol?
In Argentina, no one had ever done what this collective was doing — speaking so openly about abortions and how to have one on your own. Mines says most of the volunteers like her were scared of getting arrested. And the Argentine government had a record of going after abortion cases. Between 1990 and 2008, nearly 450 abortion cases were prosecuted in Argentina.
Not all feminists were happy about what the collective was doing. Mariana Romero, a prominent reproductive health researcher and advocate for abortion rights in Argentina, worried that the helpline could inadvertently reduce access to misoprostol.
""I said, do we have to do this so public? You're nuts,"" Romero recalls. ""You are going to make the pharmaceutical company that produced misoprostol take it out of the market."" Despite the publicity around the hotline, in the end, no volunteers were arrested. And misoprostol remained available.
Barbie gets abortions
In 2010, a year after the hotline started, Lesbianas y Feministas got more provocative with the way they talked about abortion. They published a
manual
on how to self-manage an abortion with misoprostol and without a doctor.
It did not look like a conventional medical text. The cover was pink with two big rainbows and illustrations of pills with smiley faces. On the back, there was a picture of Barbie in a pink convertible, with sunglasses and a glamorous scarf over her head, along with the words ""Barbie, how'd it go?""

""It was awesome,"" Barbie replies. The implication was that any woman can have an abortion — even Barbie.
Lesbianas y Feministas created a manual on how to self-manage an abortion with misoprostol and without a doctor.

The manual was thorough — more than 100 pages long — and it went into vivid detail, including drawings of how to insert the pills into the vagina.
""It was a bestseller,"" says Mines, the hotline volunteer. ""It had two printings of 10,000 copies each.""
Other helplines and feminist groups in Latin America started using the manual to help more women. Mines herself was able to help thousands of women through the helpline.
But some abortion activists believed sharing information on the phone and through written manuals wasn't enough.
Mexico: The birth of ""accompaniment""
In 2010, the activist Veronica Cruz met volunteers from the Argentine helpline at a conference about safe abortions. Cruz is the founder of a feminist collective called
Las Libres
(The Free) in Mexico. She recalls a lot of hype around abortion helplines at the gathering, but she was skeptical.
""How do you know for sure that those women are not at risk?"" she asked the volunteers. ""You gave them information and then what? Did she get the pills? Did she follow the instructions correctly? Did she end up in the hospital? You actually don't know anything.""
Cruz, on the other hand, did know how the women she helped in Mexico fared because she used a different method: ""
acompañamiento
.""
In Spanish,
acompañamiento
means being with someone, supporting them, or just keeping them company. When helping a woman seeking an abortion,
acompañamiento
has come to mean being there for someone throughout the whole process of an abortion, from beginning to end, regardless of the legal risks.
Cruz started doing
acompañamiento
in 2000 — the same year she founded Las Libres, and nearly a decade before any of the helplines started in Latin America. At the time, abortion in Mexico was essentially banned. In the state where Cruz lives, the only exception was for women who were raped. But even in those cases, hospitals often denied women their right to the procedure.
Sponsor Message
In the beginning, Cruz focused her work on these women. Through Las Libres, she worked with a gynecologist to help women who had been raped get safe, legal abortions. One day, she saw the doctor use a new method: misoprostol, the ulcer medication that women in Brazil first started using for abortions in the late 1980s.
As she watched the doctor administer the pills, Cruz had a realization.
""I can just buy the pills, tell the woman how to use them? That was an incredible discovery for me.""

Not long after, another woman came to Las Libres who wanted an abortion but wasn't a rape survivor — which meant that she didn't qualify for a legal abortion. Where they lived, ending a pregnancy that wasn't a result of rape, through any method, carried a prison sentence for the woman and anyone who helped her.
Cruz decided to accompany the woman, despite the risks. She told the woman to buy the pills at the pharmacy. In Mexico, even though misoprostol technically required a prescription, you could often get it over the counter. Then Cruz gave the woman the same instructions she had seen the OB-GYN give.
Even though Cruz had seen how the pills work and how simple it was to use them, she says it was nerve-wracking to support someone through an abortion without a doctor. Cruz was on standby the whole time. It was late at night when the woman took the pills.
""So I slept with my cellphone on my chest,"" Cruz recalls. ""All the time … in case it rang or something.""
The next day, the woman went to a doctor, who confirmed that the pregnancy had ended and that there hadn't been any complications. It was Cruz's first time doing accompaniment. And in her eyes, it had gone smoothly.
Sponsor Message
After that, when someone contacted Las Libres for an abortion and they were not rape survivors, Las Libres didn't go to the gynecologist for help. They handled it themselves.
""We promised ourselves that we were never going to leave anyone without access,"" Cruz says. ""Whatever we had to do.""
If a woman couldn't afford to buy misoprostol, which was expensive in Mexico, Las Libres would give her the pills free.
Sometimes women had leftover pills and offered to give them to Las Libres. Cruz told them to pay it forward.
""The next woman who comes,
you
are going to give her the pills as a gift and you're going to tell her about your experience,"" Cruz said.
Cruz would set up a meeting between the two women, in a park or at a mall. The woman who'd had an abortion would share her extra pills and her story. By connecting women directly — one by one — Las Libres was recruiting volunteers and building a network.
Las Libres helped create accompaniment networks that, today, reach every state in Mexico.
But over the years, some activists criticized Cruz's approach. At that conference in 2010, Cruz recalls activists telling her that ""what we were doing — of personally accompanying the women and giving them the pills — was risky for us. For us and for the whole movement.""
These activists, who were fighting to legalize abortion, didn't want the movement for abortion rights to be associated with people who were breaking the law.
Many abortion-rights activists across Latin America found themselves on opposite sides: Some were fighting to legalize abortion — those women were playing the long game. Others, like Cruz, were actively breaking the law, because women who needed abortions immediately couldn't wait until the law changed.
One group realized that they didn't have to choose between the two sides.

Argentina: From an art to a science

Nearly 35 years after that
Encuentro
in San Bernardo, in the fall of 2024, another
Encuentro
kicked off in Argentina. This time, the annual gathering brought 50,000 women to a small city called San Salvador de Jujuy, right by the Andes Mountains.
They flowed through the downtown streets in a big demonstration, like a river of women.
In Jujuy, Ruth Zurbriggen was hard to miss. She was usually the person with the megaphone and seemingly endless energy.
Zurbriggen is one of the founders of an Argentine accompaniment network:
Socorristas en Red
(First Responders Network). It's now the biggest abortion accompaniment network in the world. And to make that happen, she and the Socorristas decided to build systems, turning
acompañamiento
into a science.

Whereas Cruz, the founder of Las Libres, thought that women could figure out accompaniment on their own, the Socorristas built a whole accompaniment method and even have a school to train volunteers —
La Escuela Socorrista
(the Socorrista school).
In school, trainees learn the Socorristas' method, which includes holding an in-person workshop for women who are interested in having an abortion and administering a survey. That survey is exhaustive. It asks straightforward questions, such as the person's age and how far along they are in their pregnancy. Other questions are more personal, such as why the woman wanted to have an abortion, whether her partner supported her choice and whether she expelled the embryo. They tracked the answers in spreadsheets, carefully documenting trends in women's experiences self-managing abortions with misoprostol.
One question on the survey inadvertently helped the Socorristas strengthen their relationships with doctors. They asked: How did you find out about us?
""Thirty percent had come to us recommended by health care professionals,"" Zurbriggen recalls. ""And that's when we said, 'What's happening? Who are they?'""
Sponsor Message
Zurbriggen was surprised by that high number. Most doctors in Argentina did not support abortion at that time. The Socorristas wanted to understand why medical staff were referring patients to them, so they started scheduling appointments with these health care providers, as if they were personal appointments. That allowed the activists to talk to the clinicians in private.
""We started creating a bond with professional medical staff. And then we started asking them 'what's the problem if you write two prescriptions a month for us? Nothing, right?' And they'd write us two or three prescriptions for us with different dates. And we'd get male names from friends or sons, and the prescriptions would be under male names,"" Zurbriggen says. She describes the process as ""very DIY."" It was also illegal — and the Socorristas don't do it anymore.

The Network: Déjà vu
Doctors and nurses were often willing to help even though they risked losing their license by doing so. One OB-GYN named Gabriela Luchetti, who worked in the public health system for 30 years, says she felt ""relief"" sending people who needed an abortion to the Socorristas.
Luchetti said, ""Someone was going to do what we didn't dare to because we had a license, and we were afraid of the law.""
The fight to legalize
Many feminists who had focused their fight on getting a law to protect abortion weren't comfortable with Zurbriggen and the Socorristas' work. Just as activists criticized Cruz's accompaniment work in Mexico, they believed Socorristas would damage their country's movement for abortion rights because it would be associated with criminal activity.
But the Socorristas' accompaniment work always went hand-in-hand with the fight to legalize abortion.
In 2018, when the Argentine Congress first debated passing an abortion law
, Zurbriggen and other Socorristas were there, speaking to representatives, along with other abortion-rights groups.
Sponsor Message
They shared data they had been rigorously tracking for six years. In that time, they'd accompanied nearly 20,000 abortions. Their data challenged stereotypes Argentinians had about abortion. They showed that the women who are most likely to have abortions are already mothers, and that many of them are religious.
Some of the other feminists who testified in front of Congress, like the researcher Mariana Romero, had been critical of the Socorristas. But she, and other skeptics, came around. ""They were radical, but, if they weren't, I don't know if things would have happened the way they happened,"" Romero says.
In December 2020 the senate voted to legalize abortion in Argentina and in January 2021 it was officially signed into law
. Now any woman can go to a hospital or a community clinic and ask for an abortion up to 14 weeks, no explanation needed.

The campaign in Argentina inspired feminists all over Latin America. Argentinians made the green bandana the symbol for their movement and the fight to legalize abortion across the region became known as the Green Wave. Within a couple of years, Colombia and Mexico also decriminalized abortion.
One might think that once abortion was legalized in Argentina, the work of Socorristas wouldn't be necessary anymore. Women could go straight to doctors for the procedure. And yet, Socorristas are just as busy as they were before abortion was legalized.
The year after abortion became legal in Argentina, more than 13,000 reached out to the Socorristas. Of those, more than three-quarters chose to have a self-managed abortion with the collective's support. In other words, the vast majority of these women preferred to self-manage their abortions with
acompañamiento
over going to a doctor.
Some OB-GYNs like Luchetti, who signed prescriptions for the Socorristas every once in a while, understand why so many women are making this choice. She says, ""The Socorristas method is far superior to medical care and is different and better. It's warm, friendly, committed.""
Another doctor, Nadya Scherbovsky, mentioned that Socorristas make themselves available 24/7, while the public health system has strict schedules.
People who need an abortion aren't the only ones who are reaching out to Socorristas. Zurbriggen says she sometimes gets calls from OB-GYNs who ask her about how to use abortion pills, because she has more experience with medication abortion than many doctors in Argentina.
The Socorristas have become international experts on self-managed abortion with pills. A 2022 study published in
The Lancet Global Health
looked at their accompaniment method for pregnancies under 9 weeks, and it found that it was just as effective and safe as a medication abortion managed in a clinic.
""Misoprostol is a technological revolution that when you put it in the hands of women and those who need an abortion, it generates another revolution,"" Zurbriggen says. ""It's a cultural, social, political, medical revolution.""

As of Friday, a salmonella outbreak linked to a California egg producer had sickened at least 79 people. Of the infected people, 21 hospitalizations were reported,
U.S. health officials said
.
Organic and cage-free brown eggs from August Egg Company with specific sell-by dates distributed across nine states and retail locations should be thrown away or returned to where they were purchased,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
.
The CDC report acknowledged that the number of sick people in the outbreak was likely much higher than the number reported, because most people with salmonella recover without seeking medical care or getting tested for the bacterial infection.

August Egg Company voluntarily recalled 1.7 million dozen eggs that may be contaminated with salmonella,
according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
. In a company announcement shared by the federal agency, the egg supplier said that as soon as it found possible Salmonella contamination, it began diverting all eggs from its processing plant to an egg-breaking facility,
which pasteurizes the eggs to remove bacteria
.
The recalled eggs were sold under several brand names, including Clover, First Street, Nulaid, O Organics, Marketside, Raleys, Simple Truth, Sun Harvest and Sunnyside.
The recalled eggs were sold in California and Nevada with sell-by dates from March 4, 2025, to June 4, 2025, at grocery stores and retail locations including Save Mart, FoodMaxx, Lucky, Smart & Final, Safeway, Raley's, Food 4 Less and Ralphs.
They were also distributed to Walmart locations in Nevada and California and seven other states — Washington, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nebraska, Indiana and Illinois —with different sell-by dates ranging from March 4, 2025, to June 19, 2025.
In
the CDC report from Friday
, officials confirmed they had identified two illness ""sub-clusters,"" groups of people who became sick after eating at the same location or event, such as a restaurant. According to the report, eggs were served at both locations.
Last month,

4 exercises that can prevent (and relieve!) pain from computer slouching and more
In fact, regularly exercising your feet and ankles has been shown to reduce the risk of injury, prevent and alleviate pain and improve overall foot health, says
Dr. Adam Tenforde
, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.
Foot care experts share six exercises to try at home. Whether you're gearing up for that big soccer game, recuperating from a long day at work or just want the strongest feet possible to avoid trips and falls in the future, give them all a try or start with just one.
Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions, experience pain or have preexisting foot conditions like bunions, plantar fasciitis or achilles tendonitis.
Exercise 1: Foot doming
Beck Harlan/NPR
This exercise is like doing crunches for your feet. It targets your ""foot core,"" the muscles that work together to stabilize the foot for dynamic movement, Davis says.
In the same way core exercises like planks or mountain climbers are important for total body movement, strengthening your foot core provides stability so the larger muscles that move the foot and ankle can do their job and protect against pain and injury, Davis says.
Life Kit
Want to reduce soreness after a workout? Make time for this 4-step routine
How to do it:
Start in a seated position, Tenforde says. Ground both the heels and the toes while pulling back the ball of the foot to raise your arch. Once raised, squeeze the arch muscles for a few seconds. Hold for two to three seconds for 10 repetitions to start.
Once you've got the hang of it, try the same exercise standing, then slowly move up to 20- to 30-second holds for three to five repetitions to build endurance, Tenforde says.
Sponsor Message
Foot doming can be practiced daily. Incorporate it into everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or waiting in line at the grocery store, he says.
Exercise 2: Wall stretches
Beck Harlan/NPR
This exercise can be effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow to your feet, says podiatrist
Ebonie Vincent
. It's especially helpful if you suffer from plantar fasciitis.
How to do it:
Stand up facing a wall. Then, wedge the toes of one foot against the wall, with the foot at about a 45-degree angle, keeping the heel on the ground. Place your hands on the wall for support if needed. Slowly begin to bend the knee of that elevated foot and bring your body forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your calf and the bottom of your foot.
Vincent suggests holding the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeating three times on each side, up to three times a day.
Exercise 3: Toe spreads
Beck Harlan/NPR
Did you know you have the ability to spread out your toes as wide as you can spread out your fingers?
If that idea seems wild, it's probably because for many people the range of motion in the toes has been limited by a lifetime of toe-constraining footwear, Davis says.
The lateral stretching of toe spread exercises can help improve your flexibility and motor control, protect against bunion pain and increase foot stability, Tenforde says.
How to do it:
Spread your toes as wide as possible and then bring them back to
a neutral position. To isolate the correct muscles, it's best not to flex or extend your toes as you go, Davis says.
If you find that tough, try using toe separators, the kind you might use while getting a pedicure. Simply squeeze your toes against them for a few seconds, then stretch as far outside of them as you can for another few seconds.
Sponsor Message
Try two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions
daily. Don't be discouraged if you have limited mobility at first, says Tenforde. Over time, your muscles should get stronger and you should be able to stretch wider.
Exercise 4: Toe Yoga
Beck Harlan/NPR
Don't worry, no miniature yoga mat required here. But like other yoga practices, toe yoga — or toe-ga, as Davis and Tenforde call it — can improve your balance and foot stability by strengthening a number of your toe muscles.
Strong toes are important for the ""push-off"" function needed to walk or run, among other things, Davis says.
How to do it:
Stand with your feet on the floor and lift up your big toe while keeping your lesser toes on the ground. Then, raise your lesser toes while keeping your big toe on the ground.
Do two to three sets of 10-15 repetitions daily, Tenforde says.
Exercise 5: Calf raises
Beck Harlan/NPR
Yep, they're not just for rounding out leg day at the gym. Since they mimic the propulsive phase of walking or running, Tenforde says calf raises are great for strengthening the stabilizing muscles and ligaments of the foot and ankle. But take care: while it might look easy, this exercise is often done wrong, he says.
How to do it:
To get the most out of a calf raise, slowly rise up onto the front of your foot by activating your arch and lifting your heel as high as is comfortable. Then, use those same muscles of your arch and big toe to slowly lower the heel back down to the ground.
It's common to roll to the lesser toes and the outside of the foot on your way down, but that works the wrong muscles and can lead to injury, Tenforde says.
Once you've got the right mechanics down, aim for two to three sets of 10-15 reps every other day. Start with double leg calf raises and then move to single leg if you're up for a challenge, Tenforde says.

Exercise 6: Hold hands with your feet
Beck Harlan/NPR
This one is more of a stretch to warm up or cool down — and will make your feet feel happy, says orthopedic surgeon
Dr. Erica Rowe Urquhart
.
How to do it:
Sit in a comfortable seated position. Interlace the fingers of one hand with the toes of the opposite foot and gently massage the bottom of your feet with the thumb of your free hand. Then, gently rotate the foot and ankle to help loosen any tension in the foot and lubricate your joints, she says.
By spending just a few minutes holding hands with each foot at the beginning and end of each day, you can prepare your feet for all the work they'll be doing — and then thank them for all the weight they carried throughout the day. And we could all stand to show our feet a little more care and gratitude, Urquhart says.

health,"Adriana Smith is a patient at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta. Emergency complications early in her pregnancy led to brain death, but she remains on life support as the pregnancy continues, according to her family. Her case has become a symbol of the medical and ethical issues stemming from a Georgia law that bans most abortions and confers fetal ""personhood"" rights.

By the time she ended up at a Georgia hospital with emergency complications, 30-year-old Atlanta nurse Adriana Smith was
almost nine weeks
pregnant.
Her condition, which included multiple blood clots, deteriorated as doctors tried to save her life, Smith's mother April Newkirk
told
Atlanta TV station WXIA.
This story was produced in partnership with
KFF Health News
.
""They did a CT scan and she had blood clots all in her head. So they had asked me if they could do a procedure to relieve them, and I said yes,"" Newkirk said. ""And then they called me back and said that they couldn't do it.""
She said doctors declared Smith 'brain dead' and put her on life support without consulting her.
""It's torture for me,"" Newkirk said. ""I come here and I see my daughter breathing by the ventilator, but she's not there.""
Sponsor Message
That was more than three months ago. Smith is still pregnant.
""And I'm not saying that we would have chose to terminate her pregnancy,"" Newkirk said, ""but what I'm saying is we should have had a choice.""
Except for an emailed statement, Emory Healthcare isn't commenting on the case.
""Emory Healthcare uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws,"" the statement said. ""Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.""
Georgia's law
H.B. 481
, also known as the LIFE Act, passed in 2019. It went into effect shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned
Roe v. Wade
with its
Dobbs
ruling on June 24, 2022.
The law bans abortion after the point at which an ultrasound can detect
cardiac activity in an embryo
. Typically this is about six weeks into pregnancy.
It also gives Smith's fetus the same rights as a person. The law says ""unborn children are a class of living, distinct persons"" and explains that the state of Georgia recognizes ""the benefits of providing full legal recognition to an unborn child.""
Sponsor Message
Did fetal 'personhood' mean life support was required?
Twenty states now ban abortion at or before 18 weeks' gestation; 13 of those have a near-total ban on all abortions with very limited exceptions, according to the
Guttmacher Institute
, a nonpartisan research group that supports abortion rights.
Like Georgia, some of these states built their abortion restrictions around the legal concept of 'personhood,' thus conferring legal rights and protections on an embryo or fetus during pregnancy.
Smith's case represents a major test of how this type of law will be applied in certain medical situations. Despite being unified in their opposition to abortion, conservatives and politicians do not always agree on the scope of the law in cases like Smith's.
For example, Georgia's Republican
Attorney General Chris Carr
doesn't think the law restricts the options in Smith's care, so removing her from life support wouldn't be equivalent to aborting the fetus.
""There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death. Removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,'"" Carr said in a statement.
But Republican Georgia state
Sen. Ed Setzler
, who authored the LIFE Act, disagrees. Emory's doctors acted appropriately when they put Smith on life support, he
told
the Associated Press.
""I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,"" Setzler told the AP. ""I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.""
Personhood energizes anti-abortion movement
""The problem is that Georgia's law isn't just an abortion ban, it's a 'personhood' law declaring that a fetus or embryo is a person, that an 'unborn child,' as the law puts it, is a person,"" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California-Davis and author of ""Personhood: The New Civil War over Reproduction.""
Sponsor Message
The legal concept of ""personhood"" has implications beyond abortion care, such as the regulation of fertility treatment, or the potential criminalization of pregnancy complications like stillbirth and miscarriage.
In Georgia's law, extending rights of personhood to a fetus changes how child support is calculated. It also allows an embryo or fetus to be claimed as a dependent on state taxes.
But the idea of personhood is not new, Ziegler said.
""It has been the goal for virtually everyone in the anti-abortion movement since the 1960s. That doesn't mean Republicans like that. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's what's going to happen. But there is no daylight between the anti-abortion movement and the personhood movement. They're the same,"" she said.
The personhood movement has gained more traction since the Supreme Court's
Dobbs
ruling in 2022.
In Alabama, after the state's Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people, the state legislature had to step in to allow fertility clinics to continue their work.
""This is sort of the future we're looking at if we move further in the direction of fetal personhood,"" Ziegler said. ""Any state Supreme Court, as we just saw in Alabama, can give them new life.""
Georgia's law and pregnancy outcomes
In Georgia, dozens of OB-GYNs have warned the state law interferes with patient care -- a problem in a state with one of the worst
maternal mortality rates
in the U.S., and where Black women are more than twice as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women.
Former members of Georgia's
Maternal Mortality Review Committee
have linked the state's abortion ban to
delayed emergency care
, and the deaths of at least two women in the state, as ProPublica recently
reported
.
The personhood provision is having a profound effect on medical care, said Atlanta OB-GYN
Dr. Zoe Lucier-Julian
.
Sponsor Message
""These laws create an environment of fear and attempt to coerce us as providers to align with the state, as opposed to aligning with our patients that we work so hard to serve,"" said Lucier-Julian.
Lucier-Julian said that's what happened to Emory Healthcare in the case of Adriana Smith.
But
Cole Muzio
, president of the conservative Christian Frontline Policy Council, says the state's abortion law shouldn't affect how Emory handles Smith's care.
""This is a pretty clear-cut case, in terms of how it's defined in the language of H.B. 481. What this bans is an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. That is the scope of our law,"" he said.
""Taking a woman off life support is not an abortion. It just isn't,"" he added. ""Now, I am incredibly grateful that this child will be born even in the midst of tragic circumstances. That is a whole human life that will be able to be lived because of this beautiful mother's sacrifice.""
A
lawsuit
challenging Georgia's law and its impact on public health is still working its way through the courts. It was filed by a coalition of physicians, the ACLU of Georgia, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and other groups.
Smith's mother April Newkirk said her daughter had initially gone to a different Atlanta-area hospital for help with severe headaches and was sent home, where her symptoms quickly worsened.
""She was gasping for air in her sleep, gargling,"" she told the station. ""More than likely it was blood.""
Now, Newkirk said the family is not sure the fetus will even survive the stress involved in months of life support — or escape the risks of severe disability.
""My grandson may be blind, may not be able to walk, wheelchair-bound, we don't know if he'll live once she has him,"" she said.

But she added that the family will love him no matter what.

About two decades ago, Namibia was one of the hardest-hit countries in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. More than one in three adults tested positive for HIV.
Dr. Mark Dybul remembers visiting a clinic in rural Namibia and meeting a woman and her baby. She was HIV-positive and was terrified of passing the virus on to the child. She named her baby No Hope in the local language.
""That's one of the most devastating things you could ever hear,"" Dybul says.
A game changer
The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, soon changed everything.
Sponsor Message
President George W. Bush created PEPFAR in 2003 and reauthorized it in 2008. Dybul was the principal architect of PEPFAR while he was at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he was later appointed U.S. global AIDS coordinator.
PEPFAR has since given out billions every year to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with programs like free drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission and widespread treatment of HIV-positive people to keep the virus from progressing to AIDS and to keep it from being spread to others.
The State Department has credited it with saving 26 million lives so far.
In an interview with NPR this week
, Dybul tells a story about how he went back to Namibia and ""here she was — and here that child was, four years later, because of the support from the American people that provided the antiretroviral therapy to her, which prevented her child from actually getting the virus"" — which can be passed from mother-to-child not only during delivery but with breastfeeding.
Dr. Mark Dybul addresses a Senate hearing on global health issues in 2015. He was an architect of PEPFAR, the program created by President George W. Bush to stop the spread of AIDS. Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and brought more stability to countries hard hit by the virus, he says.

What will happen to PEPFAR?
Now the future of PEPFAR is hazy. On Tuesday, President Trump asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid that lawmakers had already approved in 2024 and 2025 budgets — including $400 million allocated to PEPFAR.
Sponsor Message
The cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases.
It's part of an ask, known as a rescission request, that would eliminate a total of $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.
The move would codify cuts already made by the U.S Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which dismantled USAID and absorbed it into the U.S. State Department in the first months of Trump's term and dramatically reduced PEPFAR's reach.
NPR asked the State Department to comment on the impact of aid cuts on PEPFAR. The State Department did not respond in time for our deadline for publication.
Congressional decision awaited
Congress now has 45 days to respond to Trump's memo.
The move comes after a March
ruling
by U.S. District Judge Amir Ali that the Trump administration acted ""unlawfully"" by halting foreign aid without Congress's approval.
The rescission request ""put the ball squarely in Congress's court,"" says Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention organization receiving PEPFAR funds that led the lawsuit.
""Congress, at least to date, has moved not at all. The question really is, will they act?"" Warren asks.
Some members of Congress have signaled they want to keep PEPFAR from being slashed — so PEPFAR's future is still uncertain.
Nonetheless, it has been an up-and-down year for PEPFAR. The program's work was
initially halted
in the days following Trump's inauguration.
A few weeks later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed PEPFAR to resume operations again — but only or treatment of existing HIV-positive patients and
HIV prevention
measures for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
That doesn't represent everyone at risk for HIV infection.
There are still 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, which means the pool of people who need treatment will grow rapidly without more prevention, Warren says.
Sponsor Message
These cuts do ""exactly the opposite of what this administration says they want to do, which is to get countries to own their AIDS response and own their budget,"" Warren says.
""We all want to see that transition, but we're making it harder for countries by not helping them reduce the burden of treatment programs. And in fact, we're going to add to it.""
Dybul agrees.
""It's important to note that this was never intended to be a forever program,"" he says in his NPR interview. ""But if we don't stay in the game, all of those gains will be lost.""
""Eventually we should be in a position where there is no PEPFAR. But it can't be done overnight,"" Dybul says.
He still remembers how ""absolutely catastrophic"" HIV was only a few decades ago.
The epidemic was particularly brutal because HIV often kills young people in the prime of their lives, Dybul says.
""You would have entire villages run by orphans because all the adults were gone. Countries could have ceased to exist. That's how devastating it was.""
Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and made hard-hit countries like Namibia more stable, he says.
And U.S. assistance also offered hope, Dybul says. Because of PEPFAR, ""no one would any longer name their child No Hope,"" he says.
Without it, there ""is a hopelessness that occurs when you see everyone dying around you, you think you're going to die,"" Dybul says.

The country's main mental health agency,
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, commonly known as SAMHSA, is in the process of being dissolved. It has lost more than a third of its staff of about 900 this year as part of recent reductions in the federal workforce. President Trump's budget bill cuts $1 billion from the agency's operating budget, and its mission is
being folded into a new entity
shaped by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Lawmakers, researchers and health care providers are concerned. At a hearing held by the House Appropriations Committee last month, some Democratic lawmakers grilled the health secretary about this.
Rep. Madeleine Dean
, representing suburban Philadelphia, asked Kennedy about these changes in light of
the recent progress in overdose deaths
.

8 theories why fentanyl deaths are plummeting
""A 27% reduction in overdose deaths in this country,"" said Dean, who has personal experience with opioid addiction through one of her sons who's in recovery. ""Overdose is still stealing a generation in this country. So why in God's name are we shuttering SAMHSA?""
""We are not shuttering SAMHSA,"" Kennedy responded, mentioning his own history of addiction and the loved ones he's lost to overdose. ""What we want to do is we want to shift that function into a place where we'll be able to administer it more efficiently.""
In March, Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services announced that SAMHSA, and other divisions,
would be combined
into a new entity called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.
SAMHSA was created in 1992
through bipartisan legislation signed by President George H.W. Bush. The agency was tasked with supporting community-based mental health services and addiction treatment and prevention. It mostly accomplished this through grants to states, communities and private groups for mental health and addiction related services.
In recent years, the agency's budget has grown to address the increasing demand for mental health and addiction care. In 2024, SAMHSA's budget was
about $7.5 billion
, the bulk of which flowed to states for specialized programs to address mental health issues and addiction.
Sponsor Message
For example, the agency gave over $519 million for 988, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, and behavioral crisis response services, and a little over $1 billion for mental health service block grants.
Health
A checkup for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 2: Still lots to do
'Backbone of behavioral health'
""The SAMHSA grants are absolutely necessary,"" says psychologist
Rachel Winograd
at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis. She directs the university's addiction science team, which receives SAMHSA funding. They've used the money to buy and distribute medications for substance use disorders, overdose prevention, and for a range of services to people with addiction, says Winograd, ""whether it's drop-in centers, recovery, housing, treatment, delivery, you name it.""
Those funds ""are the backbone of behavioral health in this country,"" she says. ""If those grants were to go away, we'd be screwed.""
Improved access to Naloxone, a medication to reverse opioid overdose, made possible through SAMHSA grants to states, has contributed to the reduction in overdose deaths, says
Miriam Delphin-Rittmon
, the former assistant secretary of the agency. Based on data collected by SAMHSA, she says, ""The number of [overdose] reversals has continued to go up.""
Funds from the agency have become a lifeline for rural communities, says
Adriatik Likcani
, a marriage and family therapist and professor at the University of Central Missouri, in Warrensburg, Mo.
""Rural communities don't have a lot of funding locally to fund treatment or recovery, so SAMHSA grants brought life into those communities,"" says Likcani, who also runs
Recovery Lighthouse
, a small non-profit offering recovery services for addiction. ""It funded initiatives that they were never able to fund and helped start these recovery centers that helped us meet the need.""
Before that, he says, people with addiction had to travel an hour or more for treatment.
They would ""go to a rehab for 21 days or 30 days and then come back home and no service is present to be able to continue working on their recovery or go to prison because of drug related crimes,"" he says.
Sponsor Message
One example of an initiative introduced and funded by SAMHSA, he says, was the idea of using peer specialists – people themselves in recovery who are trained to help others with addiction.
""In Missouri, we did not have peer support and it was through SAMHSA grants in early 2000 where they funded these systems to hire peers to join the workforce,"" says Likcani.
Public Health
The government suggests defunding the 988 suicide hotline for LGBTQ+ youth
It helped meet a workforce shortage, he adds, and helped develop a more effective system for recovery from substance use disorders
.
And it was so successful, he says, that the state is funding peer support programs across Missouri. ""It started from zero to over 60 organizations now being contracted within state systems to provide peer support.""
Loss of technical expertise
The immediate impact of the recent changes at SAMHSA on Likcani and his colleagues in rural Missouri, has been the loss of technical support from the agency's regional office in Kansas City, which was shut down on April 1 along with all the agency's regional offices across the country,
""They came on the ground teaching us best practices,"" says Likcani. ""They worked hands-on with organizations, from developing strategic plans [to helping] you understand how federal funding works.""
And while he hasn't lost funding yet, he is anxious that he and other communities like his might lose funding to keep their recovery centers open.
Elsewhere in the country, too, state agencies and providers that rely on SAMHSA funding and technical support are feeling isolated, lost and reluctant to reach out to the federal staff left at the agency, says
Dr. Eric Rafla-Yuan
, a psychiatrist in San Diego, Calif.
""Often their contacts have been fired, the contacts go unanswered. You sort of have the sense across a lot of the health agencies that you're just on your own,"" says Rafla-Yuan, who also works with the California Office of Emergency services, co-chairing a group to ensure equitable access to 988.
Sponsor Message
The agency not only provided the funds to its grantees, says Rafla-Yuan, they also provided expertise and guidance to effectively use those funds. For example, for states and communities who received SAMHSA grants to set up a crisis response system through 988, the agency provided guidelines for what a ""crisis system should look like,"" he says. ""What staffing ratios should be, what kind of qualifications should folks have.""
But now with so many of the federal staff gone, grantees don't have anyone to help them troubleshoot problems with their crisis response systems. ""All of that is really uncertain,"" he says. ""There are no answers at all.""
These issues were among the topics discussed at a forum organized by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Peter Welch, D-Vt., to understand the potential impacts of changes to the US Health and Human services, including the dismantling of SAMHSA.
""This dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and subject matter expertise will be felt by states and communities who rely on SAMHSA's policy and programmatic guidance to promote mental health, prevent substance misuse, and provide treatments and supports that foster recovery,"" said Trina Dutta, the former chief of staff at the agency under the Biden administration.
Recent investments in the agency – through bipartisan legislation – had achieved remarkable successes in lowering both opioid overdose and, in some age groups, suicide deaths in the country, Dutta said.
At the House Appropriations Committee hearing, Kennedy told lawmakers that his moving SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) would allow the agency to better address all chronic diseases including mental illnesses and addiction. But Rep.Dean pressed him to explain his thinking behind this.
""Why would we, when we are finally seeing some success, bury that success, put it in an AHA program?"" Dean asked. ""We have to now rehire people and figure out what their roles will be within AHA?""

Kennedy didn't answer her question, but said he would ensure people with addiction have access to overdose prevention and other medications."

Archeologists studying a forested area in northern Michigan say they've uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern half of the United States.
The researchers used a drone equipped with a laser instrument to fly over more than 300 acres, taking advantage of a brief period of time after the winter snow had melted away but before the trees had put out their leaves.
Science
The Oldest String Ever Found May Have Been Made By Neanderthals
This allowed the drone to precisely map subtle features on the surface of the exposed ground, revealing parallel rows of earthen mounds. This is what's left of raised gardening beds that were used to grow crops like corn, beans, and squash by the ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, in the centuries before European colonizers arrived.
The mounds appeared to continue on beyond the surveyed area, the researchers say, showing agriculture at a surprisingly vast scale in a place that wasn't a major population center.

""We haven't even been able to locate any significant settlement sites in this region. There's a couple of tiny little villages,"" says
Jesse Casana
, a professor of anthropology at Dartmouth College and one of the authors of a new
report
in
Science
. ""So it's really shocking in this case to see this level of investment in an agricultural system that would require really enormous amounts of human labor to make happen.""
It's especially odd given the relatively poor growing conditions that far north, especially during a period of colder temperatures known as the Little Ice Age, as well as the presence of wild rice right nearby, says
Madeleine McLeester
, a Dartmouth anthropologist who led the research team.
""Why are they investing so many resources into cultivating maize where it's very, very difficult to cultivate maize?"" McLeester wonders. ""It's an interesting puzzle, to be sure.""
Other experts on ancient agricultural systems say the new find is stunning.
""This astonishing paper shows how much we've underestimated the geographic range, productivity, and sustainability of intensive Indigenous agriculture across North America,"" says
Gayle Fritz
, an anthropologist with Washington University in St. Louis.
""The study is outstanding in many ways, one being the long-term collaboration between Menominee tribal members and non-Indigenous archaeologists,"" she says — with the other being the combination of new technologies plus ""old-fashioned, ground-based excavation and survey.""
Sponsor Message
The scale was ""unexpected""
While some people may envision historical Native Americans as mostly hunter-gatherers or nomads, ""that is very incorrect,"" says Casana.
""By the time colonists arrived, what they were encountering were a lot of pretty sedentary communities all over North America who were practicing various forms of farming,"" he says.
The Salt
Oyster Archaeology: Ancient Trash Holds Clues To Sustainable Harvesting
It's hard to really know how extensive that farming was, however, because evidence usually isn't well-preserved. European settlers generally took over and developed the most fertile land, eventually erasing signs of past indigenous practices with their own plowing and development.
The site mapped in this new study is part of Anaem Omot, which means the ""Dog's Belly"" in Menominee. It's an area along the Menominee River on the border between Michigan and Wisconsin, and is of great cultural and historical significance to the Menominee tribe.
The region contains burial mounds and dance rings. It's also known to have agricultural ridges, ranging from 4 to 12 inches in height, because previous work back in the 1990's had mapped some of them.
""These features are really difficult to see on the ground, even when you're walking around, and they're difficult to map,"" says McLeester.
That difficulty, plus concerns about proposed mining activities in the area, is why the research team — which included the tribe's historic preservation director,
David Grignon
— wanted to see if new technology could reveal more acres covered with the earthen agricultural rows.
McLeester says they thought they'd find some more rows, but also expected that others would have eroded away since the last mapping effort.
""It was really just a test, more than anything else, to see what could we see, what was still there,"" she says.
But the drone surveys revealed that the field system was ten times bigger than what had been previously seen.
""Just the scale, I would say, was unexpected,"" she says, noting that they surveyed less than half of this historic region and the agricultural ridges appear to keep going on beyond the area that they studied in detail. ""They just had a huge field system.""
Sponsor Message
Tip of the iceberg
This degree of intensive farming in a very northerly location that's not even farmed much today is probably just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" says Casana.
""One of the interesting things about this study is that it kind of shows us a preserved window of what was probably a much more extensive agricultural landscape,"" he says.
John Marston
, an archaeologist with Boston University who wasn't part of the research team, agrees with that assessment. But if this is the tip of the iceberg, he says, ""it may be that the rest of the iceberg has melted.""
The only sites comparable to this discovery can be found in arid regions around Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona, he says, where archaeologists have discovered the traces of large-scale irrigation systems used in ancient Native American agriculture.
""That is the only place in which I'm familiar with landscape features of agriculture that are as well preserved at as large a scale as what we have here in this example,"" he says. ""It's really unusual.""
Susan Kooiman
of Southern Illinois University, an expert on the precontact Indigenous peoples of Eastern North America, says she was ""pretty blown away"" when she learned of this discovery.
""There's not a lot of remnant agricultural fields in eastern North America in general, just because of modern plowing and ground disturbance and development,"" she says. ""And so to find intact, ancient indigenous agricultural fields in any state, at any level, is very rare.""
The size of this particular field system astounded her.
""It requires a lot of labor to create these fields, to clear the forest. This is dense forest, now and then. To clear it, only with stone tools, is a lot of labor, a lot of work,"" she says, noting that the researchers also did excavation work that shows the ancient farmers were deliberately modifying the soils to improve its fertility.
Sponsor Message
""The amount of work, and just how far these fields extend, is beyond anything that I think people suspected was going on this far north in eastern North America,"" she says.
If this same kind of drone technology is used to search other relatively undisturbed areas of forest, Kooiman says, ""we may find more remnants of farm fields than we were expecting originally.""
There are some historic accounts from European settlers and indigenous groups that describe extensive farming, and researchers know that the city of Cahokia, by the Mississippi River, used intensive agriculture to support ten to twenty thousand people.
The ancestral Menominee community that built the agricultural system uncovered by this new research, however, seems to have been less populous and hierarchical than a place like Cahokia, showing that large-scale agriculture may have been a part of life in very different kinds of societies.
""The question now is, what are they doing with all this stuff they were growing?"" says Kooiman. ""Who exactly was consuming all of the stuff that they were producing on these fields?"""

For close to two decades, the U.S. Agency for International Development has partnered with countries around the world to combat neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs. The term refers to a group of diseases that affect more than a billion people, causing severe pain, disfigurement, disability and in some cases death.
They're
referred to as ""neglected"" because they disproportionately affect populations living in extreme poverty and thus don't attract investment from the pharmaceutical industry.
Now, as part of sweeping cuts to foreign aid that began on Inauguration Day, the Trump administration has frozen $114.5 million appropriated by Congress for the NTD Program's 2025 budget. If that funding isn't restored, advocates say, nearly a billion dollars' worth of medicines donated by private pharmaceutical companies is likely to go undelivered or expire.
Sponsor Message
That's according to a statement submitted to Congress by the Neglected Tropical Diseases Roundtable, a U.S. nonprofit organization that advocates for the control and elimination of these diseases worldwide.
NTDs are parasitic and bacterial diseases that typically have complex, unfamiliar names — like ""onchocerciasis,"" ""lymphatic filariasis,"" ""schistosomiasis,"" and ""human African trypanosomiasis,"" to list just a few of the
21 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization
.
Recognized by researchers as
one of the most cost-effective interventions
in global health, the control and elimination of NTDs accounts for a minute portion of U.S. foreign assistance — less than 1%. But that funding has had a major impact, primarily because private pharmaceutical companies have donated billions of dollars' worth of drugs on the condition that USAID covers the cost of distributing them. Indeed, to date the USAID NTD Program has delivered more than 3.3 billion treatments to more than 1.7 billion people. It has helped 14 countries eliminate at least one NTD and put 15 other countries on track to do so within the next five years.
Now that the program has been eliminated, advocates fear those lifesaving drugs may not reach the communities that need them.
""The pharmaceutical firms guarantee delivery of the drug to a country's storehouse, but then it's up to the country and the [nonprofit] partners to figure out how to distribute it,"" said Darin Evans, a former contractor with USAID. ""And the big question now is how to get the drug that is already sitting in warehouses out into the field — to the communities that need it.""

Advocates also worry that the pharmaceutical firms that manufacture the drugs could decide to revisit their commitments and potentially halt production entirely. ""The reality is that when we go, the NTD donor space will collapse,"" said a former USAID staffer who asked to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from the Trump administration. ""We're talking complete collapse.""
The USAID NTD Program was created in 2006 when Congress appropriated $15 million for the scale-up and integration of control efforts targeting five of the most common NTDs. Researchers with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wrote in a
2011 book
about NTDs that the program was so effective
within its first few years that it ""resulted, even with a change in administration, in a significant increase in U.S. government investment."" (The Gates Foundation is a sponsor of NPR and this blog.)
The lynchpin of this success, advocates say, has been the outsized contribution by pharmaceutical firms of free medicines to ministries of health in countries where these NTDs are a heavy burden. That includes 880 million treatments valued at $975 million slated for distribution in 2025. ""I don't know of any other health program where the pharmaceutical [companies] have stepped up like this,"" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.,
said in 2019 as he urged
his colleagues to pass the
End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act
.
That law was passed and reiterated U.S. government support for distribution of the donated drugs, as well as mapping and surveillance of cases, spraying for mosquitoes and other vectors of disease transmission, and integrating efforts to target multiple NTDs, many of which can be
addressed simultaneously
.
That public-private partnership has proven to be so cost-effective that it's described by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
as one of the ""best buys"" in global health. ""Every $1 invested in NTDs by the U.S. government leverages $26 in donated treatments,"" according to the
CDC
, which
develops
global policy and guidelines for NTD control programs and conducts research aimed at improving diagnostic tests and other tools. According to the NTD Roundtable, U.S. support has led to more than $32 billion in donated medicines to date.

The former USAID staffer
said that for years, Rep. Smith was a passionate champion of the bill in the House. ""Now he's not saying anything,"" they said. ""Republicans started this program and now Republicans are trashing it."" Smith's congressional office did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
A model for public health programs
The global fight against NTDs began in earnest in 1974, when USAID joined other donors and national governments in establishing the
Onchocerciasis Control Program
. Spearheaded by the World Bank, the program aimed to rid areas of the black flies that transmit
river blindness
, or onchocerciasis, an ancient scourge caused by parasitic worms that can rob people of their sight. For years, that effort focused primarily on
aerial spraying
of the fast-flowing rivers and streams where the black flies breed.
At the time, river blindness affected an estimated
37 million people
worldwide, with prevalence rates of
up to 80%
in large parts of West Africa. Scientists reported that in the most highly affected areas, 1 in 10 adults had been blinded by the disease and more than 1 in 3 suffered visual impairment, along with agonizing itching caused by an immune response to dead or dying worms. With few able-bodied persons left to tend the fields, food shortages
forced villagers to abandon
the fertile farmland in fly-infested river valleys and relocate to higher ground.
Dr. William H. Foege, a former director of the CDC who is credited with devising the global strategy that led to the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s, recalled living in villages in Nigeria where river blindness was endemic. ""I would see people constantly scratching,"" he said, adding that the itching was, for many people, ""the first thing they knew in the morning and the last thing they knew before they fell asleep.""
Then came a breakthrough. A 1982
study
in Senegal showed that a single dose of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin could be used to safely treat river blindness, stopping the itching and preventing blindness. Manufactured by Merck under the brand name Mectizan, ivermectin was originally developed to deworm livestock and pets. But Merck researchers suspected it might also work in humans. Though he knew the drug would never turn a profit, Roy Vagelos, then the company's chief executive, approved a budget for research and development.
Sponsor Message
Several years and millions of dollars later, Mectizan was approved for human use and Vagelos approached Foege, then head of the Atlanta-based nonprofit Task Force for Child Survival (now the Task Force for Global Health), with a proposal: Merck would donate Mectizan — ""as much as needed, for as long as needed"" — if the task force could devise a system to distribute the drug to affected communities in remote rural areas. Mectizan works by killing the juvenile worms that cause symptoms. However, because it doesn't kill the adult worms that produce the larvae, the drug has to be administered every six to 12 months for up to 15 years, the lifespan of the adult worm.
Thus was born the Mectizan Donation Program, the longest-running philanthropic program of its kind, which has helped five countries eliminate river blindness — including, most recently,
the West African nation of Niger
.
The program pioneered a
model
for combatting NTDs and other infectious diseases. In the nearly four decades since its launch in 1987,
similar public-private partnerships
have emerged to treat trachoma, which causes blindness;
lymphatic filariasis
(or elephantiasis);
schistosomiasis
, a parasitic infection that can cause liver damage; and intestinal parasites in children. Together, these programs reach more than a billion people per year in low-income countries through a strategy known as mass drug administration, whereby everyone in a given area is treated — even if they aren't sick or infected.
In addition to helping eliminate the various target diseases, mass drug administration has yielded important
collateral public health benefits
. ""We've actually been knocking off these diseases we didn't expect,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. Studies have shown, for example, that mass administration of ivermectin
reduces the prevalence of scabies
, the prevalence of African eye worm (loiasis), and the
spread of malaria
.
Sponsor Message
""And then there's this really extraordinary observation of declines in overall child mortality,"" says Hotez. Indeed, University of California San Francisco-led
research
supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has shown that a twice-yearly dose of azithromycin for the elimination of trachoma, a blinding eye disease, is associated with a 14% reduction in deaths among children under 5.
Hotez, who has
long crusaded
against parasitic worms and co-authored
the 2005 paper
that rebranded them as ""neglected tropical diseases,"" worked closely with the George W. Bush White House and members of Congress to secure the initial $15 million in funding for the USAID program.
""The support for it was so bipartisan,"" he says. ""I would literally go from talking about NTDs at a prayer breakfast with Sam Brownback, the very conservative Republican senator from Kansas, to the office of [Democratic] Senator [Patrick] Leahy, and they would work together on it, and it wasn't a big deal because the program is so cost-effective and it was so obvious that we should fund it.""
Decades of progress in peril
Now those hard-won gains are at risk of unraveling.
""It's a very long, intensive process to get rid of [river blindness],"" said Evans. More than 99% of cases of river blindness occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where a number of countries are nearing elimination. While Niger is the only African country to be declared free of river blindness to date, ""others — Mali, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Tanzania — are getting close,"" Evans said. ""Now we stand to lose 40-plus years of investment toward achieving that goal.""
This year the USAID NTD Program, with a budget of $114 million, had planned to distribute roughly 200 million doses via mass drug administration campaigns. About half of those were to be tablets of Mectizan, which is also used to eliminate
lymphatic filariasis
, a painful parasitic disease. Also known as elephantiasis, the disease can lead to abnormal enlargement of body parts, including legs, feet, toes and genitals, making it difficult for people to move or walk.
Sponsor Message
In a statement to NPR, a State Department spokesperson said USAID's NTD program was determined ""to not fit within the standards laid out by Secretary Rubio for U.S. foreign assistance, which must make the United States stronger, safer, or more prosperous."" The department spokesman added that supporting U.S. national security and U.S. interests ""requires an agile approach. We will continue to make changes as needed.""
Still, advocates remain hopeful that funding will be restored. They warn that pausing treatment will only perpetuate the problem, prolong the fight, and add to the cost. Indeed, missed rounds of mass drug administration can lead NTDs
to bounce back
, increasing the amount of drug needed to achieve success.
""What's frustrating is that, in so many places, we were on the brink of elimination,"" said Angela Weaver, vice president of NTDs at Helen Keller Intl, a nonprofit that had been supporting USAID-funded efforts to control lymphatic filariasis and trachoma in six countries in West Africa. ""The cuts to USAID not only jeopardize this progress, they also risk wasting the investments made to date."" Weaver, who helped launch USAID's NTD Program in 2006, says that one of the principal aims of the program in the early years was to identify the
most effective and efficient strategies
. ""We spent a lot of time demonstrating to Congress the cost-effectiveness of the program — how we integrated different disease-specific control activities and how we scaled them up.""
Weaver added that as funding increases allowed the program to expand to more countries, USAID's pharmaceutical partners increased their production capacity to meet the growing need for donated drugs. ""It was unbelievable,"" she says. ""What other program can go to a country and say hey, we have all of these drugs to treat these terrible diseases you have, and they're free?"" To see the program eliminated in the name of cutting waste, fraud and abuse has been ""devastating,"" she says. ""This is about the most vulnerable people in the poorest parts of the world that just want access to basic medication.""

grant
to support African governments and institutions in taking over the critical research needed to strengthen NTD elimination efforts in their respective countries. ""Benjamin Rush, the great physician during the Revolutionary War, once said that national crimes require national punishments,"" said Foege.

As President Trump touts
his own executive orders
to lower drug prices, the Medicare drug price negotiations begun during the Biden administration are continuing behind the scenes.
Two companies – Novo Nordisk and Amgen – confirmed to NPR that they had received opening price offers from the government, kicking off bargaining that could last through October. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on the status of negotiations.
Policy-ish
Trump signs executive action to lower drug prices
Medicare is negotiating the
prices of 15 drugs
, including Novo Nordisk's Ozempic. The government has until Nov. 30 to announce the agreed-upon Medicare prices. The lower prices would go into effect in January 2027.
""It's a train that's sort of moving along the tracks in the background,"" says
Ben Rome
, a physician and health policy researcher at Harvard Medical School. ""And it seems like the Trump administration has given the green light to kind of continue that process.""
Medicare drug price negotiation is still relatively new. Until the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare part D, which covers
more than 50 million seniors
, didn't have the authority to negotiate drug prices. This is the second round of annual bargaining.
Sponsor Message
""Unless the Trump administration wants to sort of totally disregard the directives of Congress, then this process will continue,"" Rome says.
The first batch of 10 drugs was negotiated last year and
announced in August
with price cuts ranging from 79% for Type 2 diabetes drug Januvia to 38% for cancer drug Imbruvica. The lower prices for those drugs are expected to take effect in January 2026.
Neither Novo Nordisk nor Amgen, whose psoriasis and arthritis drug Otezla is up for negotiation, would comment on the bargaining process other than to confirm that they had received opening offers.
On May 12, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
issued draft guidance
for the third round of negotiations, which is slated to begin in early 2026. Rome says this action is a clear sign ""the Trump administration plans to continue this program,"" even though it began under the Biden administration.
President Trump has touted his own drug price initiatives, including
an executive order on most favored nation drug pricing
, which would seek to lower U.S. drug prices and force other countries to pay more for their drugs. However, the details of how this would work are unclear.
Project 2025, a
blueprint for changing the federal government
by the conservative Heritage Foundation that Trump has echoed in many of his actions, says Medicare drug price negotiation ""should be repealed."" Until that can happen ""an Administration that is required to implement it must do so in a way that is prudent with its authority, minimizing the harmful effects of the law's policies and avoiding even worse unintended consequences,"" it says."

The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is demanding answers from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about why employees fired from his department were denied health care coverage they had already paid for.
""I urge you to take immediate action to remedy the financial and physical injury done to employees who had their health coverage illegally cancelled,"" wrote Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, acting ranking member of the committee, in a letter to Lutnick. ""I also request information about how you are ensuring that such abuse of employees never occurs again.""
The letter, sent to Lutnick on Wednesday, follows
reporting by NPR
that Commerce Department employees who were fired, reinstated by court order, and fired again had had their health care coverage prematurely cut off. They were left uninsured – despite the fact that they'd been paying their health care premiums through paycheck deductions, and despite the federal government's policy to provide 31 days of free health care coverage after an employee is terminated.

""Commerce's failure to meet its health care obligations to its employees raises concerns about whether other forms of owed compensation, such as payment for earned leave and credit hours, are being denied,"" Lynch wrote.

Fired, briefly reinstated, and fired again
Those affected were all considered
probationary employees
, typically more recent hires although many had years of experience in their fields. The Commerce Department fired nearly 800 of them in late February and early March
as part of the Trump administration's efforts
to rapidly downsize the federal workforce. At the time, some employees were told their health benefits would end after a 31-day grace period.
But states sued over their sudden terminations, and in mid-March,
a federal judge in Maryland found that their firings were likely illegal
and ordered them reinstated. The Commerce Department brought them back and put them on paid administrative leave. Some were assured by their supervisors that their benefits would be restored. Others received new insurance cards in the mail.
Then just weeks later,
an appeals court voided the lower court order
. The very next day, April 10, the Commerce Department informed employees they were being fired once again, retroactive to their original termination dates.

""People were getting different answers from different people, different answers from the same people,"" Seid-Green told NPR.
The day before her surgery, she got an email forwarded to her by a supervisor that said the government ""had run into some issues"" but was actively working on restoring her health coverage. That gave her confidence that the surgery would be covered, especially since she'd been paying her premium.
So she showed up the next morning for her surgery. She was handed a cost estimate, paid her $150 co-pay and had the procedure. The very next day, during a follow-up visit, she learned that the Commerce Department was firing her again.
A full week after that, on April 17, she and others at NOAA received a memo from human resources informing them that their health care coverage had ended April 8, the original insurance termination date they'd been given before they were reinstated.
Without insurance, Seid-Green now owes around $15,000 for the surgery alone. This week, she says, she's gotten calls from her surgery center and her physical therapist urging her to set up payment plans.
More than a month ago, she submitted paperwork to enroll in the federal government's version of COBRA, paying for the entire cost of her health coverage, but hasn't yet gotten confirmation that she's actually been enrolled.
""I just keep telling them that it'll eventually be covered,"" she wrote to NPR this week, adding a fingers-crossed emoji.

Now, Lynch has asked Lutnick to explain why the Commerce Department did not honor its commitment to continue employees' health coverage for a 31-day period after their termination, challenging the department's decision to base insurance coverage on the employees' original termination dates after the appeals court allowed the firings to go forward. Cases challenging the firings continue to make their way through the courts.

Lynch is also demanding to know why the Commerce Department has not refunded the health insurance premiums that the fired employees kept paying. Half a dozen former Commerce Department employees at NOAA and at the CHIPS for America program told NPR that even their final pay stubs from the pay period ending April 19 show a deduction for their health care premiums.
In the brief April 10 email informing employees they were being fired a second time retroactive to their original termination dates, the Commerce Department said they would not be required to return the pay they had received while they were on administrative leave. Now some of them wonder if the government sees that as more than enough to cover the health care premiums they'd paid, for coverage that was not provided.
In his letter, Lynch asked Lutnick to reimburse all terminated employees for health care premiums paid while they were not covered. He also demanded employees be reimbursed for any medical bills that their insurance would have covered during that time.
Lynch asked that Lutnick provide the House Oversight Committee with answers and a follow-up report by June 18.
The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Lynch's letter and did not respond to multiple earlier requests for comment about the termination of fired employees' health insurance."

Can this nasal spray slow down Alzheimer's? One couple is helping scientists find out
Deisseroth and a team of researchers have come up with an explanation for how that happens.
The process involves a signal that, after a positive or negative experience, lingers in the brain, the team
reports
in the journal
Science.
Experiences themselves act a bit like piano notes in the brain. Some are staccato, producing only a brief burst of activity that may result in a reflexive response, like honking at another driver, or smiling back at a child.
Science
Chimps' rhythmic drumming and complex calls hint at origins of human language
But more profound experiences can be more like a musical note that is held with the sustain pedal and still audible when the next note is played, or the one after that.
""You just need it to be sustained long enough to merge with and interact with other notes,"" Deisseroth says. ""And from our perspective, this is exactly what emotion needs.""
If the team is right, it could help explain the emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions.
People on the autism spectrum, for example, often have trouble recognizing emotions in others, and regulating their own emotions. Schizophrenia can cause mood swings and reduced emotional expression.
But some researchers question whether this lingering signal is specific to emotion, a term with no agreed-upon definition in the scientific world.
Treatments
Did a new Alzheimer's drug keep this patient's brain healthier for longer?
""Sure, [a sustained signal] happens in emotion,"" says
Lisa Feldman Barrett
, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. ""But it also happens in all kinds of other instances,"" like when a person is concentrating or remembering.
Emoting in the lab
Deisseroth and his team set out to recreate the sort of experience that leads to an emotional response, but could be observed in a lab.
""We wanted something that would cause a negative emotion but wouldn't be painful,"" he says.
Sponsor Message
They chose a puff of air, delivered to the cornea. That meant they could use a machine that eye doctors use to detect glaucoma.
The puff from this device is ""certainly annoying, certainly aversive, but not painful,"" Deisseroth says.
The team also thought it might provoke the same response in mice, an animal that predates humans by millions of years.
It turned out that both mice and people blink reflexively in response to a puff. Both species also respond to multiple puffs by squinting to protect their eyes.
Next, the team studied the brain activity associated with these experiences. And they found two distinct phases involving different brain circuits.
The first phase is like a staccato note on a piano. In the first two-tenths of a second after a puff, there's a spike in the activity of brain circuits that process sensory input.
The second phase is more like a piano note held by the sustain pedal. During this period, activity appears in other circuits, including those involved in emotion.
When mice and people were exposed to puffs of air again and again — and again — this sustained response got stronger with each stimulus.
Behavior changed too. Both mice and people squinted more, and the people reported that they were more annoyed by the experience.
""In the mice, although we don't get those verbal reports, we saw this crucial generalization,"" Deisseroth says. ""It made them less likely to seek out rewards.""
That behavior, a failure to look for food and other rewards, is a sign of stress or some other negative state in mice.
Enter Ketamine
To confirm the finding, the team did the experiment again. But this time, both mice and people received an anesthetic called ketamine. They thought the drug might disconnect a negative sensory experience from any emotional response it would ordinarily produce.
Sponsor Message
On ketamine, the second, sustained phase of brain activity was no longer present, and responses to the air puffs changed.
Mice and people would still blink reflexively after a puff of air. But they didn't squint. And people reported that they no longer found the puffs of air annoying.
""If you remove this sustain phase, you block the emotional response as well,"" Deisseroth says.
Sort of, Barrett says.
The study shows that persistent signals in the brain play a role in altering a person or animal's brain state, she says. But that brain state could be consciousness or focus, rather than an emotion.
Ketamine, she says, interferes with all of these states.
""That tells us that the way that the brain creates emotion is how it creates everything else — how it creates thoughts, how it creates perceptions, how it creates actions,"" Barrett says. ""It's not doing something special in emotion.""
Barrett also thinks the air puffs probably mean something different to a mouse than to a person.
""The human brain has this capacity to abstract, to create meanings that go beyond motor and sensory differences,"" she says.
Barrett's concerns about how emotions are studied extends to
lots of other research
.
The underlying problem, she says, is that scientists have yet to agree on a common definition of an emotion."

implemented by the Trump administration in recent weeks affecting access to the COVID-19 vaccines for healthy pregnant women, kids with no other health problems, and adults under 65 with no risk factors.
The CDC has dropped its recommendation that healthy children routinely continue getting vaccinated and is now saying parents should talk to their children's doctors about getting the shots.
And, starting with new boosters coming this fall, the Food and Drug Administration will
now only approve the shots
for people who are at high risk for serious complications from COVID because they are age 65 or older or have risk factors for health problems that make them vulnerable. The FDA is demanding the vaccine companies conduct large, costly studies to prove the vaccines are still necessary and safe for everyone else.

Debates over existing recommendations
Administration officials argue the shots
are no longer necessary
for healthy pregnant women, kids and
younger adults under 65
because so many people have so much immunity at this point.
Officials like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Martin Makary also
question the safety
of the vaccines, even though billions of people have gotten the shot and there's widespread consensus among most public health and infectious disease experts that the shots are very safe and effective.
With most Americans
declining to get COVID shots anyway
, many people are indifferent to the changes. In social media responses received by NPR, some people
said they were happy to see the changes, claiming the vaccines harmed them. And some outside observers agree with the changes.
""I think the pre-existing COVID recommendations, especially for anyone over 6 months of age, were pretty ridiculous and pretty extreme,"" says
Judge Glock
, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. ""I think this aligns with what we do know about the current science about the vaccines and the current risks and rewards of vaccination.""
The recommendation that parents of children may still get the shots after talking with their doctors could mean that insurers would still pay for the shots, but that's not guaranteed.
""Based on my collective observations of payer coverage of vaccines, the bottom line is to expect variability in coverage,"" says
Richard Hughes,
a health care policy lawyer who's
following the issue.
Competti and others for whom the vaccines are no longer recommended or approved may still be able to access the vaccines because doctors could prescribe them ""off-label,"" enabling people to pay for them themselves. But the shots can cost as much as about $200 each. Children getting their first vaccinations require two injections.
Competti knows she will probably still be able to get vaccinated by paying for a shot herself. But all the uncertainty and changing rules makes her anxious.

""If we're losing access to COVID vaccines, I don't know if other things are going to get taken away,"" she says. ""I'm scared.""
Another concern is the moves may confuse many doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals, making some hesitant to offer the shots even if they could.
""These new HHS changes, in the absence of any justification, fuel myths and misconceptions about COVID vaccines,"" says
Kelly Moore
, president and CEO of
Immunize.org
, an advocacy group.
""Conflicting recommendations, with professional medical societies on one side and HHS leadership on the other, will generate tremendous confusion among health care professionals and the public,"" Moore says. ""People who are confused don't act. Their default is not to vaccinate.""
Getting vaccinated to protect a family member
Healthy pregnant women aren't the only people who are worried about access to the shots.
Rachel Sampler Zelaya, 45, her husband, Jorge, 45, pose for a photo in Feb. 2025 with their children (from left) Clara, 11, Jorge 9, Lucia, 6. The Zelayas are from Cottage Grove, Minn. and want to continue to get vaccinated to protect their daughter, Lucia, who has asthma, but also to continue to protect themselves.

Ashley Hoskins, 45, and her husband, Bob, 50, who live in Nashville, Tenn., with their young daughter, also want to keep getting vaccinated. That's because Bob has to take powerful immune system suppressing drugs to prevent his body from rejecting his transplanted kidney.
""He's at a heightened risk to catch everything,"" Ashley Hoskins says. ""So not only do we have to worry about whether or not he can receive vaccines. We have always had to be vaccinated as well to provide another wall of protection around him.""
Bob Hoskins will still be able to get a shot. But now Ashley Hoskins and her daughter worry about whether they will too.
""Blanket decisions like this — it doesn't allow the families to think about their own private situation,"" Ashley Hoskins says. ""How do we protect the people that we love? People are going to get hurt. So, yeah, it's frustrating. It's scary.""
Rachel Sampler Zelaya, 42, of Cottage Grove, Minn., is concerned too.
Her 6-year-old daughter, Lucia, has asthma. So Zelaya wants to keep getting herself, her husband, Jorge, 45, and their two other healthy kids, Jorgito, 9, and Clara, 11, vaccinated to protect her too. But none of them would be automatically eligible except the youngest under the new policies.
Sponsor Message
""I'm angry,"" Zelaya says. ""It feels like I've had a choice taken away from me.""
Some administration officials, however, question whether vaccinating one person protects those around them.
""To date there is no high-quality evidence that you getting a booster to visit your grandma protects your grandma beyond your grandma getting the booster herself,"" Dr.
Vinay Prasad
, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines, said on a
CDC video
. ""Does it lead to less transmission? Does it lead to fewer instances of severe disease? We are interested in evidence to inform this claim.""
But other experts question that argument.
""Basically it seems common sense that vaccination, to the extent it reduces infection frequency or severity, could help protect others you may come in contact with,"" said Dr.
Jesse Goodman
, a former FDA vaccine official now at Georgetown University.
This would make sense, Goodman says, ""given that the vaccinated may have less frequent infections in the three to six months after vaccination and given that some studies suggest there may be reduced shedding of virus.""
For Hoskins, she's not just worried about protecting her daughter. She also wants to shield the whole family to protect everyone's health.
""It's not just a cold. It affects the vascular system, the neurological system, the immune system. And even mild cases have the potential to develop into long COVID,"" she says. ""We vaccinate for far less. And this is definitely a disease to me that needs to be vaccinated for.""
Suddenly having to worry about the vaccines again feels like a flashback to the early days of the pandemic, she says.
""It feels like we are going back in time again to where there's not a whole lot that I can do to protect my kids,"" she says."

Amy Connor
This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.
In February 2003, Amy Connor was pregnant with twin boys. One day, she went into labor — a full 10 weeks before her due date. After the birth, her sons, William and James, were both struggling.
My Unsung Hero
Her son had a meltdown in public. A stranger responded with understanding
""One of them, his heart kept stopping. The other one was on a lot of oxygen and his retina separated and they thought he was going to be blind. It was a very dramatic time for us,"" Connor recalled.
Doctors told the family that James, the baby on oxygen, needed a blood transfusion. But there was an issue — babies born prematurely can only be transfused with blood that meets much stricter requirements than blood used for adults. The hospital didn't have any blood that met the requirements for donating to premature babies.
Sponsor Message
""But [the transfusion] was absolutely necessary and without it, he might die,"" Connor said.
Quickly, the hospital put out a call to its donation organizations.
""[And] they told us that we were [also] able to put out a call. Anyone could come into the hospital and donate for a specific person if they wanted to,"" Connor said.
This was over 20 years ago, before social media existed. So, Connor and her family took the old-fashioned approach: email.
""We sent out emails to all of our friends and family, and they obviously sent them out to all of their friends and family. [Then] we just sort of sat there not really knowing if anyone would respond or if any of them would be a match,"" Connor remembered.
My Unsung Hero
When her young son was hit by a pickup truck, a stranger rushed to help
""Sitting there and waiting to find out if your child is going to get something that they need to live or die is sort of surreal. I've never experienced anything like that before.""
The wait turned out to be worth it. In total, nearly 30 people showed up to the hospital to donate blood for James. Among those, only one was a match.
""When they came back and told us that there was one match, [it wasn't] even just a sigh of relief. It's like you release all of this breath in your body that you didn't even know you were holding.""

James got the blood he needed to survive. He and his brother are now 22, and thriving.
Connor and her family will never know who donated the blood that saved James' life. Due to privacy laws, the hospital was not able to tell the family, or the donor, whose blood was eventually used in the transfusion.
My Unsung Hero
When Eleanor Heginbotham's car broke down on New Year's Eve, a group of strangers jumped in
""If I had them in front of me and I could tell them or thank them, what I would say is this: [that] one little act that took them probably half an hour or an hour out of their lives changed so many people's lives,"" Connor said tearfully.
""They are solely responsible for the fact that [James] lived, and the fact that he has grown up and that he will someday have a family. And I will never ever know who they are. I don't think there are words to say thank you enough for something like that.""

a new comet, moving on a trajectory that indicates that it whizzed into our solar system from interstellar space and is just passing through.
It's only the third time scientists have discovered this kind of visitor from outside our solar system. The first two,
'Oumuamua
and Comet Borisov, intrigued astronomers because of the chance to observe pieces from another star system beyond our own.
""This is like our chance to randomly sample what's going on in the rest of the galaxy,"" University of Oxford astrophysicist

""I think the idea that we could see bits of other solar systems flying through our own really captivated the attention of a whole lot of people who started trying to work on these things,"" says Lintott.
NASA has named this latest interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, after detecting it this week with the NASA-funded
ATLAS
(Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.
The comet is now about 420 million miles (670 million kilometers) away. Astronomers around the world are racing to use telescopes to learn more about its size and physical properties.
It's moving fast, but poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA. The object will remain visible to ground-based telescopes through September, then will pass too close to the sun for observations to occur. But in December, it will re-emerge, allowing for more studies.
And astronomers are anticipating an imminent bonanza of new discoveries of interstellar objects, thanks to the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory
, a brand new facility with unique capabilities that should allow it to spot lots of interstellar objects in the years to come.
Built with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, the facility will collect a mind-boggling amount of data on the entire southern night sky during a decade-long survey slated to start later this year."

The website that hosts the most recent edition of the National Climate Assessment
has gone dark
. The sprawling report is the most influential source of information about how climate change affects the United States.
The National Climate Assessment is widely used by teachers, city planners, farmers, judges and regular citizens looking for answers to common questions such as how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure. The most recent edition had a searchable atlas that allowed anyone to learn about the current and future effects of global warming in their specific town or state.

On Monday, the government website that hosts all of that information stopped working.
The Trump administration had already
halted work
on the next edition of the report, and fired all the staff who worked on it.
The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate report website was taken down, or whether the administration plans to create the next edition of the climate assessment as Congress mandates.
Congress requires the federal government to publish the National Climate Assessment every four years. The last edition was published in 2023, and underscored the degree to which climate change is
expensive, deadly and preventable
.
""If you are a human being in the United States, your life is already being impacted by climate change whether you know it or not,"" says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist who was one of the authors of the report. ""If we don't recognize that, it's simply because we haven't connected the dots. And the National Climate Assessment was one of the primary tools connecting those dots.""
The next edition was supposed to be released in 2027, and about 400 volunteer authors had started working on it. That work stopped after all the federal staff who coordinate it were let go in April.

Independence Day is approaching!
Imagine if, in a few days, someone has procured illegal fireworks from a couple of states over. Are you:
first in line to light them
content to watch while others set them off
going to find a fire extinguisher — just in case — while loudly condemning the activity?
Ken Carter
, a psychologist at Oxford College of Emory University, says everyone has a different level of sensation-seeking. This episode, we get into the factors at play, like people's brain chemistry, when deciding whether or not to do an activity, like setting off fireworks.

For low and average sensation-seekers, very thrilling activities like large, self-run fireworks displays can cause their bodies to produce a lot of cortisol, a stress hormone.
On the other hand, high sensation-seekers, Carter says, ""don't tend to produce that much cortisol when they're in those highly chaotic experiences. So when they're seeing those fireworks, they actually produce higher amounts of another chemical called dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter or a chemical messenger that's involved in pleasure.""
Carter has developed a 40-point self-assessment survey for people to figure out how much of a sensation-seeker they are. The survey can be found in his book,

People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer.
More than two decades after researchers first
demonstrated
that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the
brain-computer interface
(BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product.
""We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready,"" says Michael Mager, the CEO of
Precision Neuroscience
. ""It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives.""

Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet.
Treatments
This new brain-mapping device could make neurosurgery safer
Elon Musk's
Neuralink
is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision,
Blackrock Neurotech
,
Paradromics
, or
Synchron
.
Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or
generate artificial speech
.
Neuralink's 'telepathy'
Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word.

Brain Implant Restores Sense Of Touch To Paralyzed Man
A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate.
""Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts,"" says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink.
The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability ""telepathy.""

Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis.

Researchers work to create a sense of touch in prosthetic limbs
A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device.
A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the
Barrow Neurological Institute
in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull.
A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California,
describing
his experience controlling a computer cursor.
""It's freakin' wild,"" he said. ""When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it.""

A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X.
But the success was tempered by Neuralink's
announcement
a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had ""retracted,"" making the device less sensitive.
Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant.
A new technology, decades old
While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't.
Treatments
Can this nasal spray slow down Alzheimer's? One couple is helping scientists find out
Dr. Leigh Hochberg
— who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004.
Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull.
A research
video
from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email.
""It was exactly what was supposed to happen,"" Hochberg says. ""And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there.""
Sponsor Message
Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment.
BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis
reported
that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer.
""I. Am. Good,"" the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking.
Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says.
Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet.
Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity ""more accurately, more consistently and more reliably,"" Hochberg says.
In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate.
The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs.
There are even groups ""focused on putting information back into the brain,"" Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand.
Fingers that feel
The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface.
""You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone,"" says
Jennifer Collinger
, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way.""
With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling.
Sponsor Message
So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people.
One of those people is
Nathan Copeland
, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama.
Shots - Health News
Scientists Bring The Sense Of Touch To A Robotic Arm
In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand.
""With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact,"" Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. ""I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not.""
But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago.
""There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'"" Collinger says.
One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by
Ben Rapoport
, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink.
Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer.
""We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel,"" Mager says. ""If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work.""
Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain.
""We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain,"" Mager says.
Sponsor Message
That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA.
Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries.
All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says.
""We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous,"" he says.
It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data.
Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says.
Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product.
That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three."

The deep ocean covers most of the planet. Gerard Barron wants his company to be the first to mine it.
That's been his dream since 2001, when Barron's then-tennis partner asked him to invest in a first-of-its-kind project to extract gold and other metals from a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Papua New Guinea.
""I knew very little about the ocean. I knew very little about mining,"" Barron told NPR. ""But I was curious.""
Climate
The world has no rulebook for deep-sea mining. One company is pushing forward anyway
Barron, 58, is a serial entrepreneur from Australia who always seems to be in a different time zone — calling from Vancouver, London or Dubai. He's founded companies in fields ranging from finance to industrial manufacturing.
That
first deep-sea mining
project
didn't quite go as planned. The company struggled to attract financing and went bankrupt in 2019, though not before Barron sold his stake at a profit.
Along the way, he learned about a different, potentially more lucrative, opportunity: ""The big game was this nodule field off the coast of Mexico.""
Sponsor Message
That ""big game"" is a remote stretch of the Pacific Ocean, believed to hold massive amounts of minerals like nickel and cobalt. It would become the target of his latest firm,
The Metals Company
.
Barron argues that securing access to those minerals, which are used in defense and energy technologies, could help usher in a new era of industrialization for the U.S.
"" This resource can help America become mineral independent, just like it became energy independent through shale and gas,"" he says.
That argument has caught the attention of the Trump administration. The Metals Company is now seeking approval for the project from federal regulators – the first time U.S. agencies have considered such a project.
But scientists worry about the impact of deep-sea mining on a little-studied ecosystem. And most other countries say these minerals, which fall beneath international waters, aren't even America's to mine.

What is The Metals Company?
The Metals Company is a relative newcomer to the mining industry. It was founded in 2011 and went public in 2021. It's backed by companies including the engineering firm Allseas, which designs much of The Metals Company's mining technology.
It is among a handful of mining firms eyeing the same stretch of Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii, called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The U.S. Geological Survey
has estimated
that the seabed there contains more nickel and cobalt than all known terrestrial reserves combined.
Climate
Your Next Car May Be Built With Ocean Rocks. Scientists Can't Agree If That's Good
Barron, who became CEO in 2017, says mining in the CCZ is a no-brainer. Unlike traditional mining, which extracts metals from underground, the metals in the CCZ sit right on the seabed surface, bound up in trillions of potato-shaped rocks called polymetallic nodules.
""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" Barron says. ""We can pick those nodules up and turn them into metals at a fraction of the environmental and human impacts compared to mining on land.""
Polymetallic nodules containing certain critical minerals can be found scattered across the seabed in some parts of the ocean. Pictured here are manganese nodules found off the Southeastern U.S. in 2019. ""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" says Gerard Barron, CEO of The Metals Company. The company hopes to mine a region in the Pacific called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

In 2022, The Metals Company tested its mining system in the miles-deep waters of the CCZ. The technology works something like a giant, remote-controlled vacuum cleaner that sucks nodules off the seafloor. In that test, the firm retrieved 3,000 tons of nodules from the seabed, a feat unmatched by most industry peers.

By operating in the remote CCZ, Barron says his company can avoid the harms of land-based mining, which can include displacing communities or clearing forest.
""This is the perfect place,"" he says ""There's no alternative [use] for this part of the seafloor. You can't grow crops there. People can't live there. It's perfect.""
Not everyone agrees.

Scientists are raising the alarm about Trump's deep sea mining executive order
They say mining could damage a little-explored ecosystem where scientists still routinely discover new animal species.
""On land, we all see how destructive mining is. But on the seafloor, no one's going to see it,"" says Sheryl Murdock, an oceanographer at Arizona State University. ""So I don't think it's going to be less destructive. It's that people are going to be less aware of it.""
Murdock says deep-sea mining could destroy seabed habitat by removing the nodules on which sponges and other animals live. The operation would also create underwater plumes of sediment that may contain heavy metals, she says.
The Metals Company says its mining system is designed to limit environmental impacts. It plans to leave 15-20% of the nodules behind on the seabed, allowing some animals to recolonize the disturbed area. The firm says that its models suggest the sediment plumes would dissipate to background levels within two miles, only impacting the area immediately surrounding the mining operation.
The firm also points to
studies
finding that animal life in the CCZ is far less abundant than in many terrestrial mining hotspots.
Still, some manufacturers — including Volvo, BMW and Google — have
pledged
not to use ocean-mined minerals in their supply chains due to environmental concerns.
Some analysts also question the business case for deep-sea mining. Many EV carmakers have
shifted away
from using batteries that contain nickel and cobalt. There's currently a
global
oversupply
of those metals — even some terrestrial mines are going idle.
Andrew K. Sweetman, professor and research leader at the Lyell Centre for Earth, Marine Science, and Technology at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland explains how sample are obtained from deep in the ocean during research in 2021 on the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining. Many ocean researchers have raised concerns about the potential effects on an ecosystem that scientists still know relatively little about.

A 'lifeline' from the Trump administration
Just a few months ago, it wasn't clear any company would be mining the deep sea any time soon.

Mining in international waters is traditionally overseen by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). For more than a decade, the United Nations-affiliated group of more than 165 countries has been drafting regulations for a future deep-sea mining industry. Those regulations are still being negotiated – leaving companies like Barron's in limbo.
World
The global race for rare earth materials is on, and the U.S. is losing it
In April, Barron's fortunes changed. President Trump signed an
executive order
promoting deep-sea mining as a way for the U.S. to counter China's dominance of global mineral supplies. It also directed federal agencies to fast-track permitting for deep-sea mining projects, in both federal and international waters.
""The industry got a lifeline with the Trump executive order,"" says Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Everything else was kind of on a backwards treadmill.""
The order also put the U.S. at odds with nearly every other country.
""The area is an international possession,"" says Leticia Reis de Carvalho, Secretary-General of the ISA. ""Therefore, any activity without an authorization of the International Seabed Authority constitutes a violation of international law.""
The ISA defines these seabed minerals as the common heritage of all humans. Dozens of countries have condemned the Trump administration's unilateral approach to mining them.
The Trump administration says it's not bound by ISA rules. The U.S. is one of the few countries that never ratified the treaty that created the ISA, though past administrations have generally cooperated with it.
The executive order seems to have buoyed The Metals Company's prospects. Its stock price has more than doubled since Trump's signing. The firm has also announced $85 million-worth of new corporate
investment
.

What comes next?
Barron plans to seize the newfound opportunity. Days after the executive order, The Metals Company
officially applied for approval
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to begin commercial-scale mining in international waters.
NOAA
says
it is ""committed to an expeditious review"" of the application, though an exact timeline is unclear, since the agency has never conducted such a review.
If and when The Metals Company receives approval, it will likely take
at least a year
to build out a full-scale mining system, according to the engineering firm Allseas.

Deep-sea nodules were first discovered more than a century ago. Now, Barron says The Metals Company is on the cusp of hauling them up from the seabed on a commercial scale: ""I'm certain it will be while Trump is president."""

The U.S. Department of Defense will no longer provide satellite weather data, leaving hurricane forecasters without crucial information about storms as peak hurricane season looms in the Atlantic.
For more than 40 years, the Defense Department has operated satellites that collect information about conditions in the atmosphere and ocean. A group within the Navy, called the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, processes the raw data from the satellites, and turns it over to scientists and weather forecasters who use it for a wide range of purposes including real-time hurricane forecasting and measuring sea ice in polar regions.
Sponsor Message
In late June, the Department of Defense announced that it would no longer provide that data, according to a
notice published
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. The termination date was originally the end of June, but after an outcry from scientists and forecasters, it was updated to the end of July, according to the Navy.
""I was surprised, given how important it is for forecasting hurricanes and monitoring important features like sea ice,"" says Brian Tang, a hurricane researcher at the University at Albany. ""This is data that forecasters use regularly.""
The Navy did not respond to questions about why it has stopped sharing the data with scientists and forecasters.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Space Force, which is responsible for the satellites, said in a statement that the satellites and instruments are still functional, and the Department of Defense will continue to use them even as it cuts off access for scientists.
""It's not an issue of funding cuts,"" says Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a federally funded research center in Colorado that has relied on the soon-to-be-terminated Defense Department data to track sea ice since 1979. ""There are cybersecurity concerns. That's what we're being told.""
Sponsor Message
The Navy did not respond to questions about what those specific concerns might be. In a statement, a Navy spokesperson wrote only that, ""the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.""
Tracking hurricanes as they form
The Department of Defense collects satellite weather information because it has ships and planes operating all over the world, and needs information about conditions in the oceans and atmosphere.
But the Defense Department data also allow hurricane forecasters to see hurricanes as they form, and monitor them in real-time.
""What we can do with the data is we can see the structure of hurricanes,"" Tang explains, ""Sort of like an MRI or X-ray.""
For example, hurricane experts can see where the center of a newly formed storm is, which allows them to figure out as early as possible what direction it is likely to go, and whether the storm might hit land. That's important for people in harm's way, who need as much time as possible to decide whether to evacuate, and to prepare their homes for wind and water.
The data also allows forecasters to see when a new eyewall has formed in the center of the storm, which can indicate that the hurricane is about to intensify. For example, Tang says, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used the data from Defense Department satellites to observe a circular eyewall forming in Hurricane Erick earlier this month as it moved over the Pacific.
""That was a really good indication that the storm was about to intensify much more quickly than the computer models indicated it was going to intensify,"" Tang says, which allows forecasters to publish early warnings. The storm hit Mexico as a destructive Category 3 hurricane.
NOAA, which oversees the National Hurricane Center, says the loss of the Defense Department data will not lead to less-accurate hurricane forecasts this year. In a statement, NOAA communications director Kim Doster said, ""NOAA's data sources are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.""
Sponsor Message
Other satellites, operated by NASA and NOAA and by other countries, collect similar data, Tang says. But hurricanes form and intensify so rapidly that forecasters need near real-time information, which requires as many satellites as possible since no one sensor is always pointed at a given storm. Without the Defense Department data, there will be bigger gaps in time when forecasters will not know the current conditions inside a storm. That could lead forecasters to be surprised when a hurricane suddenly intensifies.
That's particularly concerning because, as the Earth heats up, large, rapidly intensifying hurricanes are
getting more common
. Storms that gather strength quickly right before they hit land are particularly deadly because people have little time to prepare and evacuate.

A scramble to keep monitoring sea ice
The Defense Department satellites were also the main source of real-time information about
changes to sea ice
.
Sea ice data is important for a lot of reasons. Permanent sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic is shrinking rapidly because of climate change, and the exact amount of ice fluctuates dramatically over the course of each year.
In any given year or season, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic informs international shipping decisions, because when there is less sea ice around the North Pole, ships can take shorter routes across the globe.
On the other end of the planet, sea ice helps slow the melting of glaciers in Antarctica, which threaten the planet with
catastrophic sea level rise if they collapse
.
Now, as a result of the Defense Department's decision, six widely used datasets about sea ice at both poles will be interrupted, according to the
National Snow and Ice Data Center
.
""We've been very reliant on these data for many years,"" explains Serreze, the director of the center. He says the Defense Department had warned him that the data would no longer be available after September.
Sponsor Message
Serreze's team had already planned to switch to an alternate source of sea ice information: a sensor on a satellite
operated by the Japanese government
. The U.S. has access to data from that sensor through an agreement between NASA and the Japanese government's space agency.
But they thought they had months to make the switch, which requires a lot of labor-intensive calibration.
And this is happening in the middle of a record-breaking year: so far in 2025 there is
less sea ice in the Arctic
than any other year since satellite records began in 1979."

A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.
Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development,
according to the Solar Energy Industries Association
, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.
Sponsor Message
But those investments are now at risk.
Climate
America's clean-energy industry is growing despite Trump's attacks. At least for now
Congressional Republicans are
on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits
as part of
a huge tax-and-spending bill
that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.
Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.
""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term
Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development,
according to SEIA
.
This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.
Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.
Climate
U.S. electricity demand is set to explode. That will make it harder to cut climate pollution
But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018,
Trump approved tariffs
on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent
post on Truth Social
, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.
Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies,
according to the financial firm Lazard
. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.
Sponsor Message
If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""
Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which
announced it was building a Georgia solar factory
in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.
""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""
The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.
""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell
Pakistan
and
Latin America
and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer
Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.
However,
tariffs on their own weren't enough
to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.
Sponsor Message
""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.
But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.
Legislative text
released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.
""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout
The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.
Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to
a study this winter
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.
""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.
Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.
Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.
""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""
Sponsor Message
Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.
Reams' group has
called for lawmakers
to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""
Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.
""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""
With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.
""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese."""

Since 2004, scientific research has shown that a full night of sleep may lend itself to
a burst of insight in the morning
.
But what about the earlier stages of sleep?
That was the question posed by a group of researchers at the
University of Hamburg
, the
Max Planck Institute for Human Development
and the
Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research
.
The research team found that even a 20-minute nap could deliver a ""eureka"" moment, and published their findings in the journal
PLOS Biology
this week.
For the study, 90  participants tracked a group of dots and decided whether the dots were generally moving towards one of the four corners of the screen.
Sponsor Message
There was a secret trick that made the task super easy: The correct response was paired with a color. Without knowing that trick in advance, however, the task was quite difficult.
Could a nap help?
To figure that out, in the middle of the task, the researchers let the participants take a 20 minute break — with the lights off, seated upon the most comfortable Ikea chair that cognitive neuroscientist
Anika Löwe
could find.
""We also told people to sleep 30% less the night before and not consume any caffeine for coming in at 1 p.m,"" Löwe told NPR.
During the experiment, participants' brain activity was measured with an electrode cap. Some stayed awake; some fell asleep.
Upon returning to the task after the break, those who napped figured out the color trick at a higher frequency than those who did not sleep. Even better: Those who managed to enter the first phase of deep sleep, known as the N2 phase. A startling 86% of those deep sleepers had a eureka moment —  more than any other group.
Célia Lacaux
, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University Geneva, who was not a part of this study, was really impressed by these results.
""I am super happy to see that they also replicated the fact that short nap is helpful for boosting insights,"" she said.

Lacaux and Löwe both say the next step is further research to determine why this is happening — at the level of biochemical level.

McDONOUGH, Ga. — An object bright enough to be seen streaking across the midday sky fell across parts of the Southeast U.S. on Thursday.

Meteors and other space debris frequently enter Earth's atmosphere, but it is rare for an object to be so bright it can easily be seen in broad daylight.
Bright fireballs are caused by friction as an object enters the atmosphere and slows down considerably. Almost all objects break into minuscule pieces before striking the ground, according

Following nearly two weeks of strikes by American and Israeli forces, there's no doubt that the key parts of Iran's nuclear program have been dealt a blow. But how bad was it? A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency document claims the damage to one site could have been minimal, while the head of the CIA has said that Iran's overall nuclear program had been ""severely damaged."" President Trump, for his part, insists that the program has been destroyed.
""It's called obliteration,"" Trump said at a press conference yesterday in the Hague. ""No other military on Earth could have done it, and now this incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace.""

Here's each of Iran's four main nuclear sites and what's known about their current condition.
Fordo
Loading...
Buried deep inside a mountain, the Fordo fuel enrichment site was the most heavily fortified of Iran's nuclear facilities. The site, which sits under nearly 300 feet of granite, contained thousands of centrifuges which were being used to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade.
American planners had worked for over a decade in preparation for a strike at the site, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters today in a media briefing. Two officers from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency were assigned full-time to searching out the site's vulnerabilities, and sophisticated computer models were used to see how to damage it. ""They literally dreamed about the target at night when they slept,"" Caine said.
Loading...
With Fordo in mind, the Pentagon developed the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-busting bomb. B-2 Spirit bombers carried the weapons to Fordo and dropped them down the ventilation shafts. They exploded in a carefully choreographed sequence, with the goal of puncturing the facility.
It was a perfectly executed strike, Caine said. But penetrating a deeply buried facility like Fordo is
extremely difficult
. Hard rock and irregularities in the geology can prevent the weapons from reaching target depths and can deflect shock waves, says Raymond Jeanloz, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied bunker-busters.
Caine stopped short of saying he believed the facility was ""obliterated"" as President Trump has claimed. ""We don't grade our own homework, we let the intelligence community do that,"" he said.
Outside of the Pentagon, others believe Fordo was significantly damaged by the strike. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission said in
a statement
that Fordo was ""inoperable"" following the strike. And speaking on
French radio
, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he believed the centrifuges at the site were ""no longer operational."" The day after the American strike, Israel
bombed access routes
to Fordo in an effort to delay any return to the facility.
Sponsor Message
David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, says he expects the damage to be ""pretty serious,"" but he adds, ""I think it may be tough to find out what happened at Fordo unless someone goes in.""
Natanz
Loading...
Before the strikes, Iran's primary enrichment site was at a facility in Natanz. The facility had been subject to sabotage and subterfuge by Israel for many years even before these attacks–including a
computer virus
that wrecked the centrifuges over a decade ago.
Partially because it was such a target, Iran moved Natanz's centrifuges into an underground hall in recent years.
Israel attacked the Natanz site on the first day of the war. It destroyed an enrichment facility on the surface known as the pilot fuel enrichment plant. Israeli war planes also struck power and other support facilities for the underground portion of the site. Israel also dropped bombs onto the buried centrifuge hall, although they did not appear to pierce the facility.
On June 22, the U.S. followed up with a strike using two Massive Ordnance Penetrators to hit the underground centrifuge halls.
""That facility was not so deeply buried and I would expect that the underground enrichment halls are also very severely damaged,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey who has studied Iran's nuclear facilities for years.
But Lewis also says that near Natanz, Iran has been digging out an enormous underground facility into the side of a mountain. That facility, whose purpose remains unclear, appears to be intact.
Isfahan
Loading...
Isfahan was Iran's main site where it prepared uranium for enrichment, and converted it into metal after it was done. Putting the uranium into metallic form is a critical step towards building nuclear weapons.
Israel struck the Isfahan site in the opening hours of its offensive against Iran. It destroyed the facility used to convert the uranium into metals, along with several other buildings inside the complex. The U.S. followed up the Israeli strikes with a salvo of dozens of submarine-launched cruise missiles.
""The above-ground facilities are completely destroyed,"" Lewis says. ""Donald Trump could definitely use the word 'obliterate.'""
But like Natanz, Isfahan had tunnels nearby. Those tunnels, which it's believed may have been used to store some of Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium, were hit, but they are thought to be largely in tact.
Arak

Most of Iran's nuclear program centered around uranium, but the nation had also built but never started a heavy water reactor that could potentially produce plutonium, another important material for nuclear weapons.
Israel
announced
it had struck the Arak reactor on June 19, destroying its concrete dome and a nearby laboratory. Although the reactor was not considered an active part of Iran's nuclear program, its destruction means Iran will likely never be able to complete it.
""The Arak reactor was not operational, and it's now
really
not operational,"" Lewis says.
The Unknowns
Experts say that, despite these strikes, Iran may still have a significant nuclear capability. Before the attacks, the IAEA assessed that Iran had more than 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that was near bomb grade. That material had been under safeguards, but now, Grossi says, the Iranians have informed the agency that they have taken protective measures, presumably moving the material to an undisclosed location.
The uranium can be stored in containers that are the size of a keg or a scuba tank, says Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""These are easily moveable, they're easily concealable, and as of now, I don't think we can be confident we know where everything is.""

In yesterday's press conference, President Trump indicated that he did not believe the Iranians had time to remove anything from the sites. ""I believe they didn't have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,"" he said.
But Albright says the uranium is stored in tough containers that might have survived the strike, especially in the tunnels at Isfahan. ""If there was any in Isfahan, in the rubble, that clearly can be dug out,"" he says.
Lewis adds that he believes Iran has other undisclosed underground facilities that could serve as backups for what's been destroyed. ""I tend to think there are more sites that we don't know about because Iran was always hedging its bets,"" he says.
Ultimately, experts say that the only way to stop Iran's nuclear program for good is to reach some sort of agreement.
""If you really want to have reasonable confidence in a solution over time,"" says Christopher Ford, a former Assistant Undersecretary of State for nonproliferation in Trump's first term, ""you need to have an agreement with some kind of cooperative verification and ongoing monitoring."""

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has spent years spreading doubt about the safety of vaccines and linking them to autism.
Dozens of studies have debunked the theory, but it has nevertheless persisted for years. Part of the reason why may be that autism diagnoses have soared over the last few decades.
Dr. Allen Frances is psychiatrist who led the task force that created the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which expanded the definition of Autism, which he says might have played a factor in that uptick.
Rates of autism have exploded in recent decades.  Could the clinical definition of autism itself be partly to blame?

The president has said the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, should be eliminated, and has appointed a group of high level officials to recommend options for restructuring or reforming the agency.

President Trump says the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, should be eliminated, and that states should take on more responsibility for responding to and preparing for extreme weather and other disasters.
That would mean big changes for the millions of Americans who rely on FEMA after hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods and other weather disasters every year. The cost of weather disasters in the U.S. has skyrocketed in the last decade, as climate change causes more intense weather and populations grow in areas that are at high risk for hurricanes, wildfires and other destructive events.
Sponsor Message
FEMA currently works with states to prepare for disasters, provides on-the-ground help during emergencies and pays out billions of dollars for repairs. Emergency management experts and state disaster response officials say that FEMA plays a crucial role that
state governments cannot handle on their own
.
Here's what we know about the Trump administration's plans to eliminate FEMA.
When will FEMA be eliminated?
President Trump says the agency could be eliminated as soon as December 2025. Speaking in the Oval Office in June, he said that major changes to FEMA would come after the Atlantic hurricane season ends in November. ""We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it back to the state level,"" the president said. He also said that the agency will immediately ""give out less money"" to states that are recovering from disasters.
The president also
appointed a council
of cabinet members, governors and emergency management experts, tasked with recommending changes to FEMA. That group, the FEMA Review Council, had its first meeting in May, and is supposed to make recommendations by mid-November. The council is expected to complete its work by May 2026, suggesting that the Trump administration intends to eliminate or restructure FEMA in the period between the 2025 hurricane season and the 2026 hurricane season.
Sponsor Message
Why is the Trump administration proposing this?
FEMA has a long history of failing to serve those who need help the most after disasters. Under the Biden administration, the agency was
taking steps to address those problems
. For example, the agency simplified paperwork, expanded on-the-ground help after disasters and made it easier for survivors to get money for diapers, food and other immediate needs.
The Trump administration is taking a different approach. The president has repeatedly suggested that FEMA is hopelessly flawed. At the first meeting of the FEMA Review Council, the council's co-chair, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said, ""The president and I have had many, many discussions about this agency. I want to be very clear. The President wants it eliminated as it currently exists. He wants a new agency.""
Doesn't Congress oversee FEMA?
Yes, and only Congress can fully eliminate FEMA, although the executive branch can act on its own to restructure or reduce the size of the agency.
Congress has its own ideas about how to reform FEMA. A
bipartisan bill
making its way through Congress would simplify the process for disaster survivors to apply for federal assistance, and remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security, giving the agency a direct line to the president.
That bill would also incentivize states to invest more in disaster preparedness, by tying it to federal aid after a disaster. The bill's focus on preparation as a core FEMA responsibility is at odds with the Trump administration's approach to reforming the agency, which has so far included
drastically cutting FEMA's disaster preparedness spending
.
What specific FEMA changes are being proposed by the Trump administration?
The president has suggested that the federal government should have a much smaller role in responding to disasters. But it's unclear what that means in practice.
Sponsor Message
At the first meeting of the FEMA Review Council, Secretary Noem said she supports a simplified payment system wherein states receive large disaster recovery block grants from the federal government, rather than tailored reimbursements and grants to cover specific repairs. And President Trump said in June that FEMA will provide less disaster-related assistance to states overall.
Bloomberg news also reported that an
internal agency memo from March
confirmed that agency leaders were considering changing FEMA's policies to make it harder for states to receive funding after disasters.
Other members of the review council suggested shrinking FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, which provides the majority of residential flood insurance in the U.S. And FEMA has already
canceled billions of dollars
of grants for infrastructure upgrades that were supposed to prevent future damage from extreme weather.
Is FEMA ready to respond to disasters right now?
By many measures, FEMA appears less ready to respond to disasters than it was before President Trump took office.
The acting FEMA director, Cameron Hamilton, was
abruptly let go in the spring
. He was replaced by David Richardson, a DHS official who has no prior emergency management experience.
After Richardson took over,
Reuters reported
more than a dozen top FEMA employees resigned, including the then-second in command at the agency. In June, the head of the agency's disaster coordination
office resigned
.
And changes to other parts of the federal government have also affected FEMA. An AmeriCorps program which trained and deployed young people to help after disasters was canceled because of an executive order signed in the early days of Trump's second term. And the Department of Homeland Security, which usually supplies
extra staff for FEMA
after particularly large disasters, is already
stretched thin
because of the administration's focus on arresting and deporting people."

509th Bomb Wing/USAF
The infographics were everywhere in the run-up to Sunday's early-morning strike on Iran's nuclear facilities by American stealth bombers.
They depicted America's bunker-busting bomb, known as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57. It was being dropped from high above the Earth by a B-2 Spirit bomber. Then,
the
graphics
showed it plowing a narrow channel deep beneath the ground — around 60 meters, or 200 feet — and erupting in an illustrated explosion.
Only America had this 30,000-pound weapon. Only America could hit Iran's most deeply buried uranium enrichment site at a place called Fordo. It was buried beneath nearly 90 meters (around 300 feet) of rock, far deeper than Israeli bombs could penetrate.

Now it appears it may not have. According to a still-classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the bombs did not ""obliterate"" Iran's Fordo enrichment site as President Trump initially claimed. Instead, the strike did only limited damage to the advanced centrifuges kept there. At most, the program was set back ""a few months,"" according to a U.S. official who confirmed the assessment's existence to NPR but remained anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
Middle East conflict
Satellites show damage to Iran's nuclear program, but experts say it's not destroyed
Yesterday, the White House disputed that claim.
""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on the social media platform X.  ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.""
Well ... not necessarily.
Decades ago, I covered another effort to create a powerful Earth-penetrating weapon. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, with an eye toward the caves of Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding, then-President George W. Bush's administration looked at whether a nuclear weapon could be dropped from a plane into the ground. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, as the concept was known, would deliver a powerful shock to underground tunnels and bunkers.
Science
If a U.S. 'bunker buster' hits a nuclear site, what might get released into the air?
But when scientists got involved, they found there was no way to get a nuclear weapon nearly deep enough to contain the blast and radioactive fallout, and the program was eventually abandoned.
I went back to take a look at the math from those early studies, and I found it actually was fairly straightforward. The so-called
penetration equations
have existed since the 1960s and depend on a limited number of factors, including the shape of the nose cone, the weight and diameter of the weapon, the speed at which it hits the ground, and — crucially — the type of earth it gets dropped on.
Sponsor Message
""It depends enormously on the kind of rock,"" says Raymond Jeanloz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the original authors of
the 2005 National Academies Study
on earth penetrators.
When I ran the calculations, using a key equation from that study, I found out that the GBU-57 could go up to 80 meters (262 feet) underground if it was dropped in silty clay.
In medium-strength rock, things looked far different. The GBU-57 could only go around 7.9 meters (about 25 feet) beneath the earth — far short of the 60 meters claimed by the infographics.
AND MATH!
Plug it all in, with the coefficient for ""Medium-strength rock"" and you get a penetration depth of 7.9 m (25 ft).
That is WELL short of the 60 m claimed and the 80-90m depth of Fordow.

This may be an important part of the reason the weapon failed to destroy its target — if indeed the bombs did fail as the DIA assessment claims.
The administration continues to dispute the reporting that the bombs failed to hit Fordo, although it has shifted its stance. ""The intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says, 'We don't know, it could have been very severe' —  that's what the intelligence says,"" President Trump told reporters travelling with him today in the Hague.
Jeanloz says that it's not just the strength of the rock. Changes in the geologic structure can also cause the bomb to change direction even as it moves through the Earth.
""If there's any variations ... including fractures or gaps, that can deflect the trajectory into the ground,"" he says. Those same variations can disperse any blast from the bomb.
It's clear that American planners were aware of these kinds of challenges. Rather than dispatching one or two GBU-57s, they sent 12 to drop on Fordo. Based on satellite imagery, it looks like they may have been dropped in pairs, with the first weapon fracturing the rock to increase the penetrating depth of the second. The bombers also appeared to target Fordo's ventilation system, a possible weak point.
Loading...
The weapons likely created a powerful shockwave in the rock that would have traveled deep underground, rattling the facility below.
But Jeanloz says those shockwaves weaken quickly as they move into the rock. Fordo's position directly under the ridge of the mountain probably maximized that protection.
In fact, going deeper is a simple solution to the threat of bunker-busters. A major conclusion from the 2005 study was that ""it's cheaper and easier for someone to dig deeper than it is to penetrate through that depth,"" he says.
Geology, it turns out, may have foiled one of the most audacious American air operations in recent memory.

It's the fourth mission brokered by the Houston, Texas-based commercial space company
Axiom Space
. The company works with SpaceX for rides to the International Space Station and coordinates with NASA for the usage of the I.S.S. for its astronauts. The European Space Agency and the governments of the participating astronauts also contributed to the mission.
The Ax-4 launch comes after multiple issues delayed the mission. First, an attempt to launch earlier this month was waived off due to weather. Then, the crew's rocket — SpaceX's Falcon 9 — developed a leak.

The mission was then delayed for nearly two weeks as NASA and its Russian space station partner, Roscosmos,
investigated a leak
on the station's Zvedzda service module, one that has previously been repaired and monitored by flight controllers for years. NASA said the pressure in the module was stable, and the crew was given the all-clear to launch.
Axiom's

""Every crew brings something new to the table. I've been incredibly impressed by the dedication and the work ethic and the passion of this team,"" said Whitson. ""It's been a joy to train alongside them, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in microgravity. It's going to be fun.""

""We'll be conducting research that spans biology, material and physical sciences as well as technology demonstrations,"" said Whitson. ""We'll also be engaging with students around the world, sharing our experience and inspiring the next generation of explorers.""
The crew is making the trip in a brand new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, designed to transport civil and commercial astronauts to the I.S.S. and other places in low-Earth orbit. The Dragon will remain docked at the station, standing ready to return the crew after their mission — splashing down off southern California in the Pacific Ocean.

a test flight
last year. NASA made the decision to return that crew in a SpaceX Dragon capsule and return Starliner

What losing billions in federal grants means for universities, and the nation
Chaikof's now 30 years old, and a Ph.D. student at Brandeis University in the social policy program, where she focuses on disability and higher education policy. And she gets around, especially at night, with the help of a guide dog — a yellow Lab named Jigg.
Chaikof is hoping research into gene therapies could someday stop or even reverse the deterioration of her vision. But she worries that cuts to federal research funding — especially at Harvard — could mean that therapy won't be ready in time to save her sight.
""I don't want to go blind,"" Chaikof says. ""And so that progression is really scary, especially when I see the cuts by the Trump administration on research funding.""
A federal judge's ruling this week that funding should be restored for about 800 terminated NIH grants does not include the widespread cancellation of grants at Harvard University. This means that more than a billion dollars from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation that were awarded to Harvard but have not yet been spent are now unavailable.
The Trump administration has said the termination of Harvard's grants are in part because of what it sees as the university's failure to address antisemitism on campus. Usher 1F, which is thought to affect somewhere around 10 to 20 infants born in the U.S. each year, is particularly prevalent in people descended from Ashkenazi Jewish populations.

""I get really angry because the Trump administration claims they're protecting us. They're not,"" says Chaikof. ""They're actively harming us. Especially when you're attacking funds for Ashkenazi Jews, Jewish diseases.""
Chaikof's parents run a foundation called the
Usher 1F Collaborative
, which is dedicated to supporting the development of gene therapies for Usher 1F. In 2017, Dr. David Corey, a Harvard scientist who'd been studying the protein that's affected in these patients, met Jessica and her sister at a conference hosted by the foundation.

""And it was really meeting the two daughters and seeing how well they're bearing up with the challenges of the disease that we said, 'You know, we might be able to contribute something here. If we don't, who else is going to do it?'"" Corey says.
They now have a good understanding of the protein that's defective in patients with Usher 1F, Corey says.
""Because we know so much about it, we could design strategies to deliver a normal copy of this protein, first to the inner ear and then to the retina,"" he says.
It's going to take more research before they're ready to begin human trials of a gene therapy that could fix that protein in patients, Corey says.
There are no existing grants to Harvard pertaining specifically to Usher 1F — and so the cancellations haven't yet directly impacted the research — but Corey says he has two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health — and he's not optimistic about their approval.
""But even if they are scored very highly by a review committee, it's unlikely that those grants would ever be awarded to Harvard,"" he says. ""That will really slow down the research.""
Already, some of his research has come to a halt. Corey had an NIH grant terminated that was supporting basic science into the genetic mechanism of hearing.
The NIH did not respond to a request for comment.
""To be at the verge of developing therapies finally for some diseases that we could only diagnose for decades and then to have the rug pulled out from under us — for the whole scientific enterprise, not just Harvard — is really discouraging,"" Corey says.
Even so, Corey said he's optimistic Harvard's lawsuit challenging the federal funding freeze will be successful. He says when that happens, his grant applications will be there, ready for funding.

Jessica Chaikoff is hoping he's right. She's confident gene therapies could work.

Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on the planet, and some of them may be on the rise. At least in
Short Wave
listener Abigail Krich-Starr's neighborhood in eastern Massachusetts, they are.
""Just being in our backyard each year, in recent years, has become harder and harder,"" Krich-Starr says. ""Last year...we were just getting eaten alive out there.""
Abby isn't alone in her corner of the United States. In 2024, the
Washington Post
published a data analysis showing that in many parts of the US, mosquito season is multiple days, or even weeks, longer than it used to be. Experts say that's a good indicator that many mosquitoes may be thriving in areas they previously didn't.

Boston-area entomologist Doug Bidlack, who traps and surveils mosquitoes for the

, attributes that shift in certain mosquito populations to warmer, wetter, and more volatile local weather. That weather is linked to climate change.
Ecologists and other entomologists we spoke to say that this increased heat could also alter mosquito behavior, shift their natural habitat, and even change how pathogens incubate and spread inside their bodies.
So how do you protect yourself against the potentially growing masses?
We asked
Vivian Zeng
, the director of public health for Sudbury, Mass, close to where Krich-Starr lives. She had a few recommendations that apply to everyone:
Assess your risk by checking local mosquito surveillance efforts, like
this one
for the state of Massachusetts
Consider rescheduling outdoor events happening between dusk and dawn, which is peak biting time for multiple mosquito species
Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, weather-permitting, to limit exposed skin
Use an EPA-approved

Everyone knows the feeling: tossing and turning during a hot, sticky night when sleep feels impossible.
It's hard for anyone to sleep well when it's hot out. And the disruptions are growing, especially for those suffering from sleep apnea, as climate change pushes up temperatures day and night around the globe. A
new study
published in the journal
Nature Communications
found that the chance of having any kind of sleep apnea problem overnight goes up by almost 50% when it's 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, compared to when temperatures are in the 50s.
And the severe cases — when people stop breathing more than 30 times in a single hour — go up, too. ""You also increase the likelihood of having severe sleep apnea by 40%,"" says Bastien Lechat, a sleep expert at Flinders University in Australia and the lead author of the new study. ""It's a striking number.""
Sponsor Message
In sleep apnea, people's breathing stops and starts while they rest. The disorder can keep people's bodies from getting enough oxygen and disrupts sleep. An estimated
one billion people
worldwide deal with sleep apnea, though it's underdiagnosed, says Lechat. And the impacts of so much disrupted sleep are hefty. People's moods and ability to work are affected, and sleep loss contributes to many other health problems from heart attacks to strokes.
""We all know what it means to have a bad night of sleep,"" says Sara Mednick, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But science shows that the cumulative impacts of bad sleep, she says, trickle out beyond the person feeling tired. ""It's a whole global problem that we need to really think about,"" she says.
The study used about two years of sleep data from more than 125,000 people, in 41 different countries worldwide.The data tracked detected sleep disruptions with sensors placed under people's mattresses and tracked changes in sleep apnea incidents over time, and compared that sleep data with temperature where people lived. As temperatures climbed, people's sleep apnea got worse.
The risk of having a severe sleep apnea event when it was very hot out nearly doubled in many northern countries, like Europe and Russia. It went up by about 40% in countries like the U.S.

Lechat thinks the differences might stem from air conditioning access — one factor the study couldn't take into account. Fewer people in Europe use air conditioners than in the U.S. or Australia, leaving people exposed to the full impact of hotter temperatures day and night.
Climate change has pushed up global temperatures over the past few decades, and that extra heat is costing people sleep already, the study found. The U.K, for example, has warmed just over a degree Fahrenheit since 2000; the overall health cost from heat-worsened sleep apnea issues grew by more than 90% as time passed and temperatures climbed. As temperatures rise further, the impacts will also grow, Mednick says .
""As temperature gets higher, our sleep quality gets lower,"" she says. And that means ""we are just going to continue to lose sleep"" as climate change marches forward.
Other recent studies found that climate change is disrupting sleep for people without disorders like sleep apnea, too.
A study
using millions of Fitbit sleep records worldwide found that people fell asleep later, woke up earlier, and slept more poorly as temperatures went up — and that people didn't get better at dealing with the heat over time.
Another study
in China found that a 10-degree Celsius (18-degree Fahrenheit) jump in temperatures cut sleep time by about 10 minutes per night in China.
The message from those studies, and the new research, is unambiguous, says Nick Obradovich, a data scientist at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Oklahoma, who worked on several sleep-and-climate focused studies in the past but was not involved in the new study. ""As temperatures increase, people sleep less well across all the measures, across all the places that we've seen so far.""
To reclaim good sleep, Obradovich says, the first goal is stopping temperatures from rising more. But controlling your sleep environment likely helps too, by cooling it down with fans or air conditioning.

""My worry is for people who can't do that,"" Lechat says. For people in vast swaths of Earth without access to cooling, the future looks hotter and filled with more sleep disruptions."

U.S. officials say that strikes conducted on three key Iranian nuclear sites have devastated its nuclear program, but independent experts analyzing commercial satellite imagery say the nation's long-running nuclear enterprise is far from destroyed.
""At the end of the day there are some really important things that haven't been hit,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who tracks Iran's nuclear facilities. ""If this ends here, it's a really incomplete strike.""

In particular, Lewis says the strike doesn't seem to have touched Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium.
""Today, it still has that material and we still don't know where it is,"" he says.
""I think you have to assume that significant amounts of this enriched uranium still exist, so this is not over by any means,"" agrees David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, which has closely tracked Iran's nuclear program for years.
The independent assessments stand in stark contrast to congratulatory statements from the Trump administration in the wake of the strikes.

The U.S. military carried out its attack against Iran's nuclear program early on Sunday, local time. Code-named ""Operation Midnight Hammer,"" the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers carrying massive 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs known as Massive Ordnance Penetrators.

It appears that a dozen of the bombs were used to strike Iran's deeply buried enrichment site at Fordo. Two weapons were also used to strike an underground centrifuge facility at Iran's main enrichment site in Natanz.
Concurrent with the bombings, a U.S. submarine launched more than two dozen cruise missiles. Those weapons hit buildings and tunnel entrances at a third nuclear site at Isfahan.

""Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated,"" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during a Pentagon press conference on Sunday. ""The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant.""
Both Lewis and Albright say that the strikes themselves may well have been effective, although it is difficult to say for sure. Satellite imagery shows six deep holes in the ground around Fordo and ashy debris over much of the site. Albright believes that bunker-busters were used to try and strike at the enrichment facility's ventilation system, along with the main hall where uranium-enriching centrifuges were kept.

""I think the purpose of the attack was to take out centrifuges and infrastructure and they feel they accomplished that,"" Albright says.
But as evidence that the strikes may have missed the uranium stocks, both Albright and Lewis point to commercial satellite imagery from the days before the strike. The images show trucks at two key sites — Isfahan and Fordo. The trucks appear to be sealing tunnels that serve as entrances to underground facilities used to store uranium, possibly in anticipation of an American attack.
An image supplied by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey shows trucks at the entrance of the Fordo enrichment facility the day before a U.S. strike on the site. Experts believe Iran could have spirited away its supply of highly enriched uranium in advance of the attacks.

Both experts believe Iranians could have also moved their enriched uranium out of the sites in the run-up to the U.S. strikes.
""There were trucks seen in imagery apparently hauling stuff away,"" Albright says. ""One would assume that any enriched uranium stocks were hauled away.""
The International Atomic Energy Agency had assessed that Iran has more than 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium 235 — enough for around 10 bombs, according to independent experts. That 60% enriched uranium is carried in relatively small containers that could fit easily into cars, says Albright.
Although Albright believes the program has been substantially set back, he thinks it could still be reconstituted.
Albright says Iran may also have thousands of uranium-enriching centrifuges that were never installed in Natanz and Fordo.  It might be possible to move the uranium to another, covert facility, where it could be enriched to the required 90% for a nuclear weapon in a relatively short period of time. Even then, Iran would have to take further steps to fashion the uranium into a weapon.
""The program has been seriously set back, but there's a lot of odds and ends,"" Albright says.  Ultimately he thinks the only way to truly end Iran's nuclear program is through additional nuclear inspections by international monitors and cooperation from the Iranian regime, probably through some kind of diplomatic agreement.

MOCKSVILLE, N.C. — The pilot of a small plane that crashed near a North Carolina airport this month had raised a wheel after landing to avoid hitting a turtle on the runway, according to a National Transportation Safety Board preliminary report.
The pilot of the Universal Stinson 108 and a passenger were killed in the June 3 crash near Sugar Valley Airport in Mocksville, officials said. A second passenger was seriously injured in the crash.
A communications operator looking out the airport office window advised the pilot that there was a turtle on the runway, according to the report released this week. The operator reported that the pilot landed about 1,400 feet down the 2,424-foot runway, then lifted the right main wheel to avoid the turtle. The operator heard the pilot advance the throttle after raising the wheel, but the airplane left her view after that.

The plane crashed in a heavily forested area about 255 feet from the runway and caught fire, officials said. The plane was wedged between several trees and remained in one piece except for a few pieces of fabric found in a nearby stream. It came to rest on its left side with the left wing folded underneath the fuselage and the right wing bent toward the tail.
Preliminary reports contain facts collected on scene, but don't speculate on probable causes, according to the NTSB's website. Those are included in final reports, which can take one to two years to complete."

Researchers have some new evidence about what makes
birds make so much noise
early in the morning, and it's not for some of the reasons they previously thought.
For decades, a dominant theory about why birds sing at dawn — called the ""dawn chorus"" — has been that they can be heard farther and more clearly at that time.
Sound travels faster in humid air and it's more humid early in the morning. It's less windy, too, which is thought
to lessen any distortion
of their vocalizations.
But scientists from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics and Project Dhvani in India combed through audio recordings of birds in the rainforest. They say they didn't find evidence to back up this ""acoustic transmission hypothesis.""
Sponsor Message
It was among the hypotheses involving environmental factors. Another is that birds spend their time singing at dawn because there's low light and it's a bad time to look for food.

""We basically didn't find much support for some of these environmental cues which have been purported in literature as hypotheses"" for why birds sing more at dawn, says Vijay Ramesh, a postdoctoral research associate at Cornell and the study's lead author.
The study, called ""
Why is the early bird early? An evaluation of hypotheses for avian dawn-biased vocal activity
,"" was published this month in the peer-reviewed journal
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.
The researchers didn't definitively point to one reason for why the dawn chorus
is
happening, but they found support for ideas that the early morning racket relates to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night, and communicating about finding food.
They analyzed audio recordings from the rainforest

The team analyzed recordings from audio recorders placed at 43 locations in the Western Ghats mountain range in southern India, which is known as a biodiversity hotspot. They examined sounds of what they determined were 69 different species of birds. They studied recordings from the hours around dawn and the hours around dusk to compare activity.
Sponsor Message
Unsurprisingly to anyone who's been woken up by a cacophony of bird calls, the ""vast majority"" of species they studied had ""significantly higher"" vocal activity at dawn compared to dusk.
Short Wave

In order to evaluate the acoustic transmission hypothesis, they first had to make a prediction: that birds that vocalize at higher frequencies would be more active at dawn than at dusk. They predicted this because they said higher frequencies are more susceptible to degradation due to environmental factors, such as wind and humidity.
But they write that they found ""no significant relationship between the peak frequency of vocalizations"" and a type of bird's preference for making noise at dawn instead of dusk.
And when the researchers looked into another ""environmental"" factor — that birds sing in the low light of dawn because that low light makes a bad time to forage — it would make sense that the same would be true at dusk. But most birds were far more vocal at dawn.
""I think that that's probably the most significant finding here, is not to demonstrate what the dawn chorus is about definitively, but to rule out this class of hypotheses, this environmental open window set of hypotheses,"" says Steve Nowicki, a professor of biology at Duke University who has studied birdsong and was not involved in the study.
What they found involves birds marking their territory and going on ""hunting parties""

The relationships they did spotlight were that birds that were more territorial, and those with an omnivorous diet, were more vocal at dawn rather than dusk.
Birds that are highly territorial ""tend to make advertisements early in the morning to sort of like claim territories or advertise where they are"" after a night of inactivity, Ramesh says.
And when it comes to food, birds are engaging in ""a lot of communication about where resources are, or often if there is a predator nearby,"" he says. They speculate that a reason that omnivorous birds have a ""marginally higher"" level of vocal activity at dawn is because they often participate in flock ""hunting parties"" that more often happen at dawn. But as to why those hunting parties happen at dawn to begin with, they aren't sure.

These songbirds sing for hours a day to keep their vocal muscles in shape
As the researchers note, there are plenty of caveats. They only studied birds in one particular tropical region in India (Ramesh says there's ""pretty much no overlap"" with bird species we see in the U.S.). They didn't observe the birds visually, and didn't record exactly when dawn and dusk started, they just used approximate times.
Plenty of hypotheses exist for the dawn chorus. Nowicki says the researchers here didn't examine some others, including that birds sing in the morning to warm up, ""like a performer doing vocal warmups,"" or that it's related to females mating in the early morning.
Sponsor Message
In the paper, the scientists noted opportunities for future research using more sophisticated audio equipment and climate monitoring.
""Sometimes there are phenomena, like the dawn chorus could be one, where there's not a single causal reason. And that's kind of frustrating to scientists,"" Nowicki adds.
There could be ""different reasons that species are more likely to sing at dawn or not,"" he says. ""In some ways that's an unsatisfying answer because it's not buttoning things up."""

""We're here to advise and help people do a better job to understand what kind of bees are around, how they're doing, what their status is."" Often, bees will be spotted in places they've never been seen before.

What the Trump-Musk breakup may mean for SpaceX and Tesla
The company said the Starship ""experienced a major anomaly"" at about 11 p.m. while on the test stand preparing for the tenth flight test at Starbase, SpaceX's launch site at the southern tip of Texas.
""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" SpaceX said in a statement on the social platform X.
It marked the latest in a series of incidents involving Starship rockets. On Jan. 16, one of the massive rockets broke apart in what the company called a ""rapid unscheduled disassembly,"" sending trails of flaming debris near the Caribbean. Two months later, Space X lost contact with another Starship during a March 6 test flight as the spacecraft broke apart, with wreckage seen streaming over Florida.

Following the back-to-back explosions, one of the 403-foot (123-meter) Starship rockets, launched from the southern tip of Texas, tumbled out of control and broke apart on May 27. SpaceX had hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning and made an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.

At the time, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called the launch ""a big improvement"" from the two previous demos and promised a much faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.
SpaceX said Wednesday night's explosion posed no hazards to nearby communities. It asked people not to try to approach the site.
The company said it is working with local officials to respond to the explosion."

If the U.S. does drop a powerful ""bunker buster"" bomb on a suspected underground nuclear weapons site in Iran, experts in radiation hazards see little risk of widespread contamination.
The site in question, Iran's mysterious
Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant
, is built into a mountainside and seems to be in the business of processing uranium isotopes. That means it would mostly be working with uranium in the form of a gas called uranium hexafluoride.
Middle East
Israeli and U.S. intelligence differ on status of Iran's nuclear program. Who's right?
""It's a big, heavy gas molecule,"" says
Emily Caffrey
, a health physics expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who explains that because this gas molecule is so heavy, ""it's likely not going to travel super-far.""
Any contamination from an attack would remain fairly localized to the site, she says.
While it's hard to estimate the risks given that the exact type and quantity of the material at the site aren't publicly known, she says, an environmental release likely wouldn't present a problem ""for anybody that's not in the immediate area.""
Sponsor Message
Edwin Lyman
, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., adds that the two major kinds of uranium isotopes found at this type of facility ""are at the low end of hazard with regard to radioactive materials.""
""So there's not a significant, dire health threat if those materials got released to the environment,"" he says. ""It would probably lead, at most, to a relatively low level of contamination — not zero — but probably fairly close to the site.""
One concern is that uranium hexafluoride gas can react with water in the air to form hydrofluoric acid. ""That is an acutely hazardous material that can harm or kill people,"" says Lyman.
But in this case, given that the site is in underground caverns ""and the bunker busters are designed to collapse the mountain above it,"" he says, ""any kind of environmental release would be relatively low since it would be essentially inhibited by this mass of rock that's rained down on it.""
Rafael Mariano Grossi
, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has said that the agency has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iran's facilities.

Trump says 'nobody knows' what he'll do as Iran warns the U.S. not to strike
One attack damaged the aboveground portion of the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant,
he recently reported
, but the ""level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event.""
Inside the site, however, he said there was ""both radiological and chemical contamination,"" with the main concern being the chemical toxicity of uranium hexafluoride and the compounds generated when it made contact with water.
The main radiation danger there would come from inhaling or ingesting uranium, he said, but ""this risk can be effectively managed with appropriate protective measures, such as using respiratory protection devices while inside the affected facilities."""

The Bogong moths of Australia aren't much to look at, says
Andrea Adden
, a neurobiologist at the Francis Crick Institute. ""They're small brown moths with arrow-like markings on the wings. They're pretty nondescript.""
Research News
'Like moths to a flame'? Here's what's going on with insects and porch lights
But these insects undertake an epic migration twice in their lifetime, traveling hundreds of miles in each direction.
Researchers have shown that the Earth's
magnetic field
helps the moths orient, but that alone wasn't sufficient. ""They needed something visual to go with it,"" says Adden.
She wanted to know what that cue might be over such a vast landscape — especially at night when there's little light.
In a paper published in the journal
Nature
, Adden and her colleagues show that the cue comes from the heavens. That is, the starry sky allows the Bogong moths to both orient and navigate.
Sponsor Message
""It's the first time that we have found an invertebrate using the stars to navigate,"" says Adden. ""And also the first time that anyone had seen neurons that specifically respond to the starry sky in the insect brain.""
A 600-mile winged migration
Bogong moths follow an annual rhythm.
They hatch in their breeding grounds in the spring in southeast Australia where it gets really hot in the summertime. ""So if they were to reproduce immediately, their larvae would starve because there is not enough food,"" says Adden.
Instead, the moths migrate over multiple nights more than 600 miles south to the Australian Alps where they settle in cooler caves, entering into a dormant phase called estivation (like hibernation but in the summer), by the millions.
""It's just moth over moth over moth,"" says Adden. ""You don't see any cave wall anymore. It's just moths.""
In the fall, they return to their breeding grounds, mate, lay their eggs, and die.
""Then the next year, the new moths hatch,"" says Adden. ""And they've never been to the mountains. They have no parents who can tell them how to get there.""
And yet they make it.
She suspected the stars might offer just the cue they need. ""The Milky Way is such a stunning sight,"" she says. ""And it seemed an obvious thing to use if you are a moth living in that environment.""
Sponsor Message
A planetarium show in miniature
To test her theory, Adden, who was doing her Ph.D. at Lund University in Sweden at the time, and her colleagues caught moths in the Australian Alps and ran them through one of two experiments in the dead of night.
The first was a behavioral test. It involved placing a moth inside what was basically a mini-planetarium that contained a projection of the night sky and no magnetic field.
""It's not an experiment that always works,"" says Adden. ""We're reliant on the moths cooperating with us."" Fortunately, enough moths did cooperate. And the result surprised the researchers.
""They didn't just circle and do twists and turns, but they actually chose a fairly stable direction,"" she said. ""Not only that, it was their migratory direction.""
In other words, the moths were using the starry sky as a compass cue to orient
and
navigate.
Adden's next question involved what was happening in the moth's brain. She recorded the electrical activity of individual neurons while rotating a projection of the Milky Way.
When she looked in the brain regions that process visual information, the majority of neurons were active when the moth was facing south. This specific direction suggests that the moths' brains encode direction by processing visual cues of the Milky Way.
Beyond the moth
Biologist
Pauline Fleischmann
at the University of Oldenburg studies navigation in
desert ants
in Greece and says she's fascinated by the study.
""It shows that insects, their world is probably much more filled with information than humans usually assume,"" she says.
In addition, the moths' ability to use both visual and magnetic information to navigate can be essential for survival — in case it's cloudy, say, or the magnetic field is unreliable. ""If one fails, they have a backup system,"" says Fleischmann.
Sponsor Message
The Bogong moths are endangered. Adden says her findings could help conserve these insects — and everything that relies on them for food. As a first step, reducing light pollution would help these moths continue their star-led journey across the Australian bush.
""Protecting the Bogong moth would help us protect the entire Alpine ecosystem,"" she says."

Rubinstein says his passion for paddleboarding began about a decade ago, after he had published a book about walking,
Born to Walk: The Transformative Power of a Pedestrian Act
. He tried it on a camping trip and preferred it over seated options like kayaking or canoeing.
""You're more intimate with the water, because you can get in and out of it. And then the perspective is different because you're standing,"" he said. ""You can look down into the water. You can see fish. You can see plants. You can see yourself more integrated into this aquatic environment.""
He set up reporting trips to Belize and British Columbia, where he was able to
learn from local paddlers
and write about it.
Inspired by growing research into the positive effects of ""blue space,"" natural environments in or around water, Rubinstein set out to experience that connection himself.
He planned his own exploration: a multi-leg paddling trip with stops along the way to speak with scientists, nonprofits and communities who have built relationships with their local waterways.
Highlights ranged from a placid morning setting out on Lake Ontario to a crowded afternoon carefully crossing shipping lanes in New York Harbor.
Paddling around the Statue of Liberty on July 14, 2023, Rubinstein says, ""with so much tour boat and ferry and commercial ship traffic, we had to do a quick loop of the island and then begin heading back up the New Jersey side of the Hudson.""

Summer is a feast for sports fans. Not only are the NBA finals happening; baseball and soccer seasons are also in full swing.
With all those games come a lot of dedicated fans often doing their own rituals around game, be it singing during the seventh inning stretch, tailgating or getting hyped up welcoming players to the field. Specifics aside, this type of repeated communal action has long fascinated cognitive anthropologist
Dimitris Xygalatas
: They can be both a source of intense division and, at other times, make thousands of people feel united as one.
And, according to a study published this month in the journal
PNAS
,
these rituals may be even more emotionally impactful than the majority of the game itself.
Sponsor Message
For this study, Xygalatas, a professor at the University of Connecticut, and his collaborators focused on the collective emotions of fans at a specific, annual Brazilian sports event called the ""Street of Fire.""
Throughout the night, Xygalatas and his team measured how emotionally aligned people were using electrodes and accelerometers hidden under fans' shirts. Across the pre-game rituals, the game itself and the following hours, the researchers were able to monitor people's heart rates, as well as how they were moving and breathing.
The researchers found that greatest sense of oneness existed during the ""Street of Fire"" pre-game ritual where fans were hyping up their team with chants while fireworks and flares are lit in the background. The enthusiasm amps up fans and players alike. Xygalatas was shocked to find that the effect even extended to a team bus driver, who was attending the event but not specifically a fan.
It's maybe for this reason that Xygalatas says that sports, ""is not about what's happening in the pitch; it's about what's happening in the terraces.""

Galápagos tortoises are herbivores native to the Galápagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador. Female tortoises typically lay up to 20 billiard-ball-sized eggs at a time,
according to the Philadelphia Zoo.
The temperature during incubation determines the hatchlings' sex — eggs incubated at 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit or lower produce female tortoises, while temperatures above 85.1 degrees produce males.
It takes the eggs four to eight months to hatch. Males can eventually weigh 500 pounds on average, while females typically weigh 250 pounds.

The leader of the country's top disaster coordination office has resigned, the latest high-level official to resign from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as President Trump moves to eliminate the agency.
Jeremy Greenberg led the National Response Coordination Center at FEMA since 2020. He resigned last week, he confirmed to NPR.
The top FEMA position is currently held by an interim leader, David Richardson, who has
no prior emergency management experience
. After he was installed in May,
Reuters reported
more than a dozen top FEMA employees resigned.
Greenberg's resignation further hobbles the agency, as the U.S. enters its busiest season for extreme weather disasters including hurricanes, floods and wildfires. Climate change is causing more severe weather across the country.
Sponsor Message
The National Response Coordination Center acts like air traffic control for first responders after a hurricane, tornado, flood, wildfire, earthquake or other national emergency. It's a crucial role, because responding to deadly disasters requires equipment, employees and expertise from multiple federal agencies and from state and local governments.

Trump wants states to handle disasters. States aren't prepared
For example, when Hurricane Helene barreled ashore last year, millions of people across multiple states were under evacuation orders. Greenberg's team was
activated three days
before the storm made landfall, according to Congressional testimony by then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell.
The center
kept track
of where FEMA employees and equipment were prepositioned before the storm arrived, how other agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and Department of Transportation were responding, where emergency shelters were located and how many first responders had been deployed to help in each affected place.
Greenberg told NPR he will continue to work at FEMA for two more weeks, and referred all other questions to FEMA leaders.
The agency did not respond to questions from NPR about who would lead its disaster coordination office after Greenberg departs. In an email to NPR, a spokesperson for the agency acknowledged Greenberg's resignation and wrote, ""FEMA has the right leadership in place to continue to be laser focused on our mission and are fully prepared for Hurricane season.""

This year, President Trump requested funding from Congress for a ""

The idea comes from Israel's Iron Dome — a network of interceptor missiles stationed at points across the country. Iron Dome and related Israeli air defenses don't get every missile fired — including some launched in the past few days by Iran — but the Israeli military says it has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was built.
And building a Golden Dome in the U.S. wouldn't be easy.
Israel is over four hundred times smaller than America. And

SHADY SIDE, Md. — The sun is barely up when Bill Scerbo unties the lines on his aging crabber and turns its bow toward open water. He and his deckhand are heading out to check crab traps in the shallows where the Rhode and West rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay.
It's something that Scerbo, who is 65, has been doing since the 1980s. It was then, just out of high school and attending community college, that he had an epiphany about his future. ""It was a beautiful day and I was sitting in an economics class and I just said, 'To hell with this. I'm done.'""

But the catches of the Chesapeake's iconic blue crabs aren't what they were for Scerbo back when he started. Today, it's just two or three per haul — occasionally four, but sometimes none. Regardless, each trap must be carefully pulled up, emptied, rinsed, rebaited, and tossed back overboard.
""There were a lot more crabs in the '90s,"" he says. ""There are more predators in the bay,"" too, notably the blue catfish — introduced to the Chesapeake for recreational purposes in the 1970s. They've thrived by eating native fish, crabs and other species.
""And, the climate's changing,"" Scerbo adds.

The Chesapeake is at an inflection point
In fact, Chesapeake Bay — the nation's largest estuary — is at a critical juncture, according to scientists and environmental advocates. Once plagued by severe pollution, it has shown notable improvement in water quality and wildlife abundance in recent years. But there's still a long way to go at a time when much of the federal funding for Chesapeake Bay, which totaled $840 million last year, is in trouble under Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" now
working its way through Congress
.
""I grew up in Baltimore city, where you used to see trash floating everywhere, where you weren't even contemplating swimming,"" says Hilary Harp Falk, president and CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF). The nonprofit is dedicated to the restoration and protection of the watershed, which spans Maryland, Virginia and four other states.
Sponsor Message
""We've seen significant changes; improvements in local water quality. We've seen oysters coming back, underwater grasses in places where we had not seen them for a long time. And … people are seeing dolphins all around the bay now,"" Falk says.
About a decade ago, a
CBF study
estimated that the bay generates $107 billion annually from the economic benefits it brings to the six states within its watershed, including from its seafood and tourism. A cleaner Chesapeake would be worth billions of dollars more, according to the study. Yet efforts to curb pollution have faced persistent challenges — from agricultural runoff to untreated wastewater discharged by towns and cities along the bay.
In its latest
annual report card
, the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) gave the bay a C for overall health — a slight dip from last year's C+, but still an improvement over the string of Ds from years past.

""The heat is not helpful for the organisms that need oxygen in the water. It's not helpful for the aquatic grasses — they burn out,"" he says.
Also drought, punctuated by extreme weather events, means crops in some parts of the watershed aren't soaking up fertilizer, ""so there was all this runoff of the leftover fertilizer that didn't get absorbed by the plants,"" he says. Instead, it's getting dumped into the bay.
It's an indication of the obstacles the bay faces, says Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, a collection of more than 300 nonprofits throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed that work for clean water. ""We are definitely at an inflection point,"" she says. ""We are making progress, and we are doing really great things, but we still do have many challenges ahead of us.""

Major cuts are proposed for programs that benefit the bay
While the Environmental Protection Agency's
$92 million Chesapeake Bay Program
— once targeted for elimination under the first Trump administration — appears safe for now, other key sources of federal support face steep cuts.
The proposed budget includes a $2.46 billion reduction to the EPA's
Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds
and eliminates $1.01 billion in
categorical grants that fund water quality efforts
. It also slashes $721 million from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development
accounts, curbing grants for rural water and wastewater infrastructure.
All of these programs benefit the bay.
Reilly says in the past, reports of the bay's death have been greatly exaggerated. People have gotten used to negative headlines over the years and haven't noticed that things have started to change for the better. ""We have seen a lot of progress, especially in those local rivers and streams,"" she says.
Reilly points to
Chesapeake WILD
, a program that gets a modest $8.5 million annual grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The program is aimed at headwater areas of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Its goal is to enhance habitat and support wildlife in those areas.
""That program has been wildly successful in increasing habitat for things like brook trout and black duck,"" she says. Unfortunately, though, its one of the programs likely to get cut.
Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, known as a strong advocate for the Chesapeake Bay, believes the network of local, state and federal programs and initiatives have been key to getting in reversing the bay's downward spiral and that cutting them would be a big mistake.

Bay oysters are staging a comeback
One bright spot in the bay this year is a recent
report
by UMCES and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. It shows that oysters — virtually wiped out in the 1980s from overharvesting, disease, habitat loss and water degradation — are staging a comeback. They've tripled in number over the past 20 years. Although they are recovering from a very low base, the findings are encouraging.
Despite the scarcity of bay oysters, a handful of aquaculture operations have moved into the bay to fill the demand from restaurants and grocery stores. Patrick Hudson owns True Chesapeake Oyster Farm in Ridge, Md. It supplies his own restaurant in Baltimore and ships varieties with names like ""skinny dipper"" and ""chunky dunker"" to customers as far west as Chicago.
They were named by Hudson himself. ""I saw a bumper sticker in southern Maryland that said, 'I don't skinny dip, I chunky dunk.' And I thought that's what we'll call the big ones,"" he explains.
The farm started as a simple oyster garden 15 years ago that Hudson, who is now 39, tended with help from his  father. Today it is a thriving business with several employees.
Around Hudson's farm, the St. Jerome Creek is visibly much clearer than most Chesapeake tributaries. That's because oysters are incredible filter feeders, he says. An adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons a day of the algae that cause dead zones.

""When there's less algae in the water, the water is more clear,"" he says. ""You can walk around the farm and see your feet in chest deep water. You can see the seaweed growing on the bottom and you know, and when you drop a crab pot into the water around here, you've got dinner.""
Hudson points out a number of blue crabs that congregate on cylindrical plastic pods in the water that are used to house baby oysters. But it's not just the crabs that have taken up residence at the farm, other aquatic species and birds have been attracted to the area, too.

President Trump has fired one of the five members of the independent commission that oversees the nation's nuclear reactors.
Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Christopher T. Hanson was terminated on Friday, according to a brief email seen by NPR from Trent Morse, the White House Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel. The e-mail said only that Hanson's ""position as Commissioner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is terminated effective immediately.""
""All organizations are more effective when leaders are rowing in the same direction,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told NPR via e-mail. ""President Trump reserves the right to remove employees within his own Executive Branch who exert his executive authority.""

Trump seeks to boost nuclear industry and overhaul safety regulator
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it could conduct its work without Hanson. ""The NRC has functioned in the past with fewer than five commissioners and will continue to do so,"" the agency said in a statement.
In a statement shared with NPR, Hanson said that he was fired ""without cause,"" and that he had devoted his term to ""preserving the independence, integrity and bipartisan nature of the world's gold standard nuclear safety institution. … I continue to have full trust and confidence in their commitment to serve the American people by protecting public health safety and the environment.""
Hanson was appointed to the NRC by President Trump during his first term in 2020 and then reappointed in 2024 by President Biden. His current term was set to expire in 2029, according to a bio on the NRC's website that has since been removed.
Some observers of the nuclear industry were sharply critical of the decision. ""I think that this coupled with the other attacks by the administration on the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could have serious implications for nuclear safety,"" says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental watchdog group. ""It's critical that the NRC make its judgements about protecting health and safety without regard for the financial health of the nuclear industry.""

The NRC was established by Congress in 1974  to strictly regulate nuclear reactors and protect Americans from exposure to radiation. By design, it has been overseen by a set of presidentially-appointed and Senate-approved commissioners, who are appointed to five-year terms. The White House has typically refrained from interfering with the agency, which is credited with maintaining a strong safety record at America's nuclear reactors since a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in 1979.
Last month, President Trump signed an
executive order
mandating sweeping reforms to the NRC. The order called for a ""wholesale revision"" of the agency's safety regulations in coordination with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Department of Government Efficiency. It also calls for reductions in force at the agency, and for a reconsidering of some radiation safety standards.
The order was one of four signed by the president to promote America's nuclear industry. Trump signed the orders flanked by smiling industry executives, including one whose company had a reactor design previously rejected by the NRC, because the agency said it had
failed to supply information
about possible accident scenarios."

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has upended medical research and public health in the U.S. in many ways. One of the ideas that could be influencing his overhaul of federal health agencies dates back to ancient Greece.
The
miasma theory
is one of the first ideas that civilization hatched to try to explain why people get sick.
""It goes back to Hippocrates,"" says Dr.
Howard Markel
, an emeritus professor of medical history from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. ""He wrote in a book called
Epidemics
, that epidemics came from some type of pollution – some pollution of the atmosphere, of the air that we breathe. And hence we got terrible infectious diseases.""
Sponsor Message
This idea that, in essence, bad air caused illness was later championed by many others, including Florence Nightingale. It also led to some things that did help fight diseases, like cleaning up sewage.
But then came the
germ theory
— one of humanity's big eureka moments. Scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch discovered it wasn't some mysterious stench in the air from rotting garbage that spread diseases. Instead, it was living microscopic entities.
""They discovered what we know as germs – microbes,"" says
Melanie Kiechle
, a historian at Virginia Tech. ""Bacteria and viruses and other microscopic materials were actually what caused illness and also explained the spread of illness from one person to another. So miasma theory is debunked, essentially.""
The discovery of germs led to breakthroughs like antibiotics and vaccines.
But in a book
Kennedy
published about four years ago,
The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health,
the now- health secretary harkens back to the miasma theory.
""Miasma theory emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses,"" Kennedy writes.
But experts say one problem is how Kennedy defines miasma theory.
Sponsor Message
""I will categorically say that miasma theory, as historians of medicine and science understand it, is not what he is saying it is, period,"" says
Nancy Tomes
, a historian of germ theory at Stony Brook University, who wrote
The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women and the Microbe in American Life.
But Kennedy's take may help explain some of his policies, especially about vaccines.
""The miasma theory is the notion that there are environmental poisons, not necessarily rotting organic matter,"" says Dr.
Paul Offit
, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania. ""For him, those environmental poisons are electromagnetic radiation, pesticides, vaccines. Vaccines are, for him, a modern-day miasma.""
And that's dangerous, many experts say.
""Can stress, air pollution, other things, make infections worse? Yes. But the cause of infections is a microorganism,"" says Dr.
Tina Tan
, who heads the Infectious Disease Society of America. ""It's the microorganisms that are making people sick.""
And vaccines have clearly been shown to safely and effectively protect people against dangerous microorganisms, Tan and others say.
""He's trying to give this false veneer of intellectualism by saying, 'Oh, the miasma theory,'"" says Dr.
Amesh Adalja
, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Health Security. ""This all just obfuscation to support his idea that vaccines are not valuable.""
But some other observers argue that Kennedy's ideas about the miasma and germ theories aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
""The real debate here is whether we can solve public health problems by developing treatments like vaccines, antibiotics, or other drugs? Or whether we will solve these problems by strengthening people's immune systems through healthier habits?"" says
Gregg Girvan
, a resident fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a Washington think tank. ""And my response is, 'Why can we not acknowledge that there is truth in both positions?'""

Open Source Centre/Airbus Defence and Space
As part of a broad strike on Iran, Israel has attacked several of the country's key nuclear facilities.
The first and most visible strike took place in the opening hours of the Israeli air campaign, which began overnight on Thursday. In a statement the Israeli military said that fighter jets had struck Iran's largest enrichment facility at Natanz. ""As part of the strikes, the underground area of the site was damaged. This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure,"" the statement read in part.

Iran attacks Israel in retaliation, killing at least 3 and injuring dozens of others
Video posted online and verified by NPR showed black smoke billowing from the Natanz site early Friday morning local time. A set of images from the commercial satellite company Airbus showed damage to the main electrical substation at the facility and to buildings used to assemble and run centrifuges.
By Friday afternoon, there were
additional reports
of Israeli strikes near Iran's other main enrichment facility at Fordow, and
at Isfahan
, which is also home to a nuclear research complex. So far, little is known about those strikes, which have taken place in the second night of fighting.

In
a statement
, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said that the attack at the Natanz plant caused damage but that no radioactive or chemical contamination had leaked outside the site.
Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, condemned the attack.
""I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances,"" Grossi said during a meeting of the agency's board of governors.
The Natanz facility has been at the center of Iran's nuclear program for decades. According to the IAEA, which has been monitoring activities at the site for the past several years, Iran has recently been using thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium to 60%, far above the levels normally used in civilian nuclear reactors. The agency says that Iran has stockpiled more than 400 kilograms of the highly enriched material, enough by some estimates to quickly build around 10 nuclear weapons.

It's unclear how quickly that material could practically be converted into bombs. During the enrichment process, the uranium is stored as a gas. It must be separated and converted into metal, which in turn must be fashioned into components for a nuclear device. Iran had a covert program to research such a weapon in the early 2000s, but it has never built a nuclear weapon before, and has said publicly it has no intentions to pursue one.
In a statement shortly after the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel believed Iran had recently restarted its program to build a nuclear weapon. ""If not stopped, Iran could produce a weapon in a very short time,"" he said in prepared remarks shortly after the strike. The operation's goal, Netanyahu stated, was to ""strike at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program.""

What Is Known About Iran's Nuclear Capabilities
Preliminary analysis of satellite imagery at the site suggests the damage from the first wave of attacks was actually limited, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who has tracked Iran's program.
Images from satellite company Airbus showed damage to several buildings at the Natanz site that are used to assemble centrifuges. The images also showed damage to support equipment, including an electrical substation and buildings that may provide power and access to the underground structures at the site.

Lewis also saw no evidence that Israel had struck at tunnels deep beneath a nearby mountain. Iran was reportedly digging those tunnels to create a more fortified facility for its centrifuges. In recent days it had pledged that it would accelerate development of a third centrifuge site, possibly in the mountain facility.
Lewis says he wonders whether military force can truly eliminate Iran's nuclear program. In the end, he says, there is no single facility or scientist that holds the key to the entire nuclear enterprise in Iran.

A new research paper published Thursday in the journal
Current Biology
suggests that humans have unique breathing patterns, almost like nasal ""fingerprints."" Not only that: These unique breathing patterns seem to say a lot about people's physical and mental health.
artpartner-images/Getty Images
Take a big inhale through your nose. Now, exhale.
Breathing may seem simple, but it's controlled by a complex brain network. Each inhale gives the human brain information about the external world. And now, a new research paper in the journal
Current Biology
suggests that humans have unique breathing patterns, almost like nasal ""fingerprints.""
One of the study authors, neurobiologist
Noam Sobel
says the idea that people might have these individual patterns isn't entirely novel.
""Many things are very common across all our brains, but at the end of the day, you have your unique brain,"" Sobel says. ""And since so much of the brain is involved in this process, we hypothesize that, therefore, respiration would also be unique.""
Sponsor Message
But researchers didn't have a way to test this theory — until PhD student
Timna Soroka
and Sobel's team at the Weizmann Institute of Science developed a new device.
It looks like a small oxygen tube. For the study, 100 participants wore continuously for 24 hours while they went about their daily activities. When the researchers analyzed the data, they saw that each person had a different nasal airflow pattern.
They also saw that those breathing patterns could predict measures of physical and mental health, like sleep, anxiety and depression.
Sobel says this insight opens up a chicken-and-egg problem: Namely, whether
changing
the way a person breathes could change health.
""The way cooler outcome is not 'you breathe this way because you're depressed,' but rather, 'you're depressed because you breathe this way,'"" he says. ""And if that's true ... can we teach you to breathe, you know, to be less depressed or to or to be less anxious?""
While researchers wouldn't recommend you hold your your breath until they determine which is true, the study is as a good reminder to take a moment to breathe today.

A widely used federal website that publishes information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions, agricultural best-practices, atmospheric changes and greenhouse gas emissions will no longer be updated, according to current and former employees familiar with the site. The website will stop publishing new content on July 1.
The site,
climate.gov
, is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As of 2021, it
received nearly one million visitors every month
, and was one of the most trusted sources of climate-related information in the U.S., according to
public surveys
about the site.
A staff of 10 people wrote content and created maps, charts and explanatory graphics for climate.gov. Those employees have now been terminated, according to Rebecca Lindsey, the former program manager for the website. NOAA did not respond to questions from NPR about changes to the site.
Sponsor Message
Lindsey had worked on
climate.gov
for 13 years, and had recently changed roles before she was laid off in February as part of a government-wide purge of what the government calls probationary employees, generally people who were new to their specific jobs.
Two other probationary
climate.gov
employees were also let go at that time, and the remaining seven staff were let go in recent weeks, according to an official who is familiar with the website's operations, and who requested anonymity because they fear they will be fired for speaking about efforts to hobble the website.
All of those laid off were experienced science communication and data visualization experts who cannot be easily replaced with other NOAA employees, according to the official.
Until recently, the website published multiple items each week that were tailored to what was happening in the U.S. For example, in the last month, the site published up-to-date information about
tornado season
and
wildfire smoke
. The site also publishes original maps, charts and other data to explain
drought trends
, changes to
rain and snowfall
and
seasonal climate outlooks
for the U.S., to help people across the country plan for heat waves, floods and other extreme weather.

Lindsey says it's clear to her that the administration is trying to get rid of public conversation about climate change and its profound impacts on people in the U.S. ""They think that climate change isn't real, and they don't want anybody talking about it,"" she says.
The White House did not respond to questions about why the
climate.gov
website has been hobbled, or what might happen to the site in the future. The site has not been fully shuttered — all the content that has been published in the past is still available as of now, although much of it will rapidly become obsolete if it is not updated.
The Trump administration has gutted other climate-related programs
across the federal government
. Earlier this year, all of the staff in charge of the National Climate Assessment were laid off. Like

After floodwaters destroyed Steve Papola's home last year in Hudson, Fla., during Hurricane Helene, he promised himself the house would be better prepared for the next major storm.
Papola and his wife were left with warped wood floors, swollen drywall and a fried electrical system.
Helene pushed up to 7 feet of storm surge onto Florida's Gulf Coast in September, becoming the deadliest hurricane in the country since Katrina in 2005. And just two weeks later, Hurricane Milton brought record-breaking rainfall of more than 18 inches in some areas, leading to further flooding inland.

You might be wondering what you can do to prepare your home for potential floodwaters. We can learn a lot from recent hurricane flood victims, like Papola, who are rebuilding with flooding and climate change in mind.
Here's how to harden your home or business from flooding.
Stay aware of future risks
Some people, like Papola, who had 4 feet of storm surge push onto his house, had to face the facts of human-caused climate change head-on: Flooding from hurricanes is becoming more intense, and it's not just a coastal issue.
Increased precipitation is leading to freshwater flooding, whether it's old stormwater infrastructure backing up, to rivers and lakes cresting, to accumulated rainfall.

Cheap and easy ways to stock your emergency go bag
Researchers at NASA say the number of people living in flood-prone areas globally has
increased by up to 24% since 2000
— that's 10 times greater than previous models predicted and is a direct result of climate-fueled storms.
Now, federal forecasters predict this year's Atlantic hurricane season will be above normal. Between June and November, there could be 13 to 19 named storms — three to five of which could be major.
Building materials matter
Some of the headache during storm cleanup includes soaked flooring, drywall and baseboards that you have to cut out and drag out of the house. If you want to stay in a place that can flood again, you can opt out of carpeting and wood floors.
Sponsor Message
Many residents are instead installing tile floors because the floodwaters don't penetrate the grout in which they're laid. So, you only have to worry about cleaning the floors after flooding. But a warning for some along the coast: It could be a messier cleanup if mud is involved.
Life Kit
Is Your Home At Risk From Climate Change? Here's How To Know
Let's talk about drywall. It absorbs floodwaters like a sponge and can fester dangerous mold if not removed. You can use cement board instead, which can dry off. As for those wooden baseboards, swap them out for PVC ones to prevent rotting upon contact with water.
Elevate
Raising your home is an expensive endeavor, starting at around $200,000. But for some rebuilding in particular flood zones, it's mandatory. FEMA requires that homes in flood zones be elevated at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation. Across Florida, concrete pilings to lift homes are going up 15 to 20 feet in neighborhoods that have experienced storm surge.
Programs may exist to help fund such an undertaking.
Elevate Florida
, for example, helped homeowners access federal grants from February to April of this year to pay for 75% of elevation costs.
And it's not just your home to consider elevating. Moving electrical outlets up higher on the wall prevents rising floodwaters from shorting out the entire electrical system or causing a fire.
Flood insurance
OK, so if you know your house has a flooding problem, you should consider flood insurance.
Flood insurance isn't just for homeowners. If you rent in a low-lying area, whether you're on the coast or inland, renters insurance is likely
not
going to cover your flooding losses. It's up to you, not your landlord, to get that added protection for your belongings inside a potentially risky structure you're leasing.
Flood insurance can be costly. But at this point, flooding is going to be expensive whether you prepare for it or not.
Sponsor Message
Papola says the reconstruction of his home after Helene is estimated at $145,000. He doesn't have to pay that himself because he has flood insurance. But that doesn't include the potential cost of elevating his home.
""The water is not a game for the middle class or the lower-middle class unless you're going to be able to insure properly and make sure that you have the ability to mitigate whatever type of loss comes with the storms,"" Papola says.
Consider the costs
It's important to recognize that all of these adaptations are, of course, pricier than rebuilding with the same materials you used before.
For instance, the cost of changing drywall to cement board (Durock is one brand) can be more than double. The same is true for replacing carpet with tile, not including the installation fees.
As for raising electrical outlets, Papola estimates the cost of all his electrical rewiring after the flood to be between $4,000 and $5,000.

trees. The Bryant Heights development in northeast Seattle is an example of this. It's an extra-large city block that features a mix of modern apartments, town houses, single-family homes and retail. Architects Ray and Mary Johnston worked with the developer to place 86 housing units where once there were four. They also saved trees.

""The first question is never, how can we get rid of that tree,"" explains Mary Johnston, ""but how can we save that tree and build something unique around it."" She points to a row of town homes nestled into two groves of mature trees that were in place before construction began in 2017. Some grow mere feet from the new buildings.

Faced with rising temps, Las Vegas is embracing a simple climate solution: More trees
The Johnstons preserved more than 30 trees at Bryant Heights, from Douglas firs and cedars to oak trees and Japanese maples.
One of Ray Johnston's favorites is a deodar cedar that's more than 100 feet tall. The tree stands at the center of a group of apartment buildings. ""It probably has a canopy that is close to over 40 feet in diameter,"" he notes.
This cedar cools the nearby buildings with the shade from its canopy. It filters carbon emissions and other pollution from the air and serves as a gathering point for residents. ""So it's like another resident, really — it's like their neighbor,"" Mary Johnston says.

Preserving this tree required some extra negotiations with the city, according to the Johnstons. They had to prove their new construction would not harm it. They had to agree to use concrete that is porous for the walkways beneath the tree to allow water to seep down to the tree's roots.
The developer could have easily decided to take this tree out, along with another one nearby, to fit another row of town houses down the middle of the block. ""But it never came to that because the developer was enlightened that way,"" Ray Johnston says.

Housing pushes trees out
Seattle, like many cities, is in the throes of a housing crunch, with pressure to add thousands of new homes every year and increase density. Single-family zoning is no longer allowed; instead, a minimum of four units per lot must now be allowed in all urban neighborhoods.
The City Council recently
updated its tree protection ordinance
, a law it
first passed in 2001
, to keep trees on private property from being cut down during development.
""Its baseline is protection of trees,"" says
Megan Neuman, a land use policy and technical teams manager with Seattle's Department of Construction and Inspections. She says the new tree code includes ""limited instances"" where tree removal is allowed.
""That's really to try to help find that balance between housing and trees and growing our canopy,"" Neuman says. Despite the city's efforts to preserve and grow the urban canopy, the
most recent assessment
showed it shrank by a total of about half a percent from 2016 to 2021. That's equivalent to 255 acres — an area roughly the size of the city's
popular Green Lake
, or more than 192 regulation-size American football fields. Neighborhood residential zones and parks and natural areas saw the biggest losses, at 1.2% and 5.1% respectively.
Seattle says it's working on multiple fronts to reverse that trend. The city's Office of Sustainability and Environment says the city is planting more trees in parks, natural areas and public rights of way. A
new requirement means
the city also has to care for those trees with watering and mulching for the first five years after planting, to ensure they survive Seattle's increasingly hot and dry summers.

How homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses against disasters
The city also says the 2023 update to its tree protection ordinance
increases tree replacement requirements
when trees are removed for development. It extends
protection to more trees
and requires, in most cases, that for every tree removed, three must be planted. The goal is to reach canopy coverage of
30% by 2037
.
Developers generally support Seattle's latest tree protection ordinance because they say it's more predictable and flexible than previous versions of the law. Many of them helped shape the new policies as they face pressure to add about 120,000 homes over the next 20 years, based on growth management planning required by the state.

Cameron Willett, Seattle-based director of city homes at Intracorp, a Canadian real estate developer, sees the current code as a ""common sense approach"" that allows housing and trees to coexist. It allows builders to cut down more trees as needed, he says, but it also requires more replanting and allows them to build around trees when they can. ""I definitely have projects I've done this year where I've taken out a tree that, under the old code, I would not have been able to do,"" Willett says. ""But I've also had to replant both on- and off-site.""
Willett recalls one development this year where he preserved a mature tree, which required proving that the site could be developed without damaging that tree. That also meant ""additional administrative complexity and costs,"" he explains.
Still, Willett says it's worth it when it works.
""Trees make better communities,"" he says. ""We all want to save the trees, but we also need to be able to get to our max density.""
But Tree Action Seattle and other tree-protection groups frequently highlight new developments where they say too many trees are being taken out to make way for housing. This tension comes after a devastating heat dome hovered over the Pacific Northwest in the summer of 2021. ""We saw hundreds of people die from that, hundreds of people who otherwise wouldn't have died if the temperatures hadn't gotten so high,"" says
Joshua Morris, conservation director with the nonprofit Birds Connect Seattle. He served six years as a volunteer adviser and co-chair of the city's Urban Forestry Commission, which provides expertise on policies for conservation and management of trees and vegetation in Seattle.

Making space for trees
Seattle's South Park neighborhood is one of those hotter neighborhoods. Residents have roughly 12% to 15% tree canopy coverage there — about half as much as the citywide average. Studies show
life expectancy rates here are 13 years shorter
than in leafier parts of the city. That's in large part due to air pollution and contaminants from a nearby Superfund site.
In a cleared lot in South Park, 22 new units are going in where once four single-family homes stood. Three big evergreens and several smaller trees are expected to be cut down, says Morris. But with some ""slight rearrangements to the configuration of buildings that are being proposed,"" Morris surmises, ""an architect who has done an analysis of this site reckons that all of the trees that would be slated for removal could be retained. And more trees could be added.""
Tree removals are allowed under Seattle's updated tree code. But removing larger trees now requires developers to plant replacements on-site or pay into a fund that the city plans to use to help reforest neighborhoods like South Park.
In Seattle's South Park neighborhood, residents have about half as much tree canopy as the citywide average. Four single-family homes once stood on this lot, where 22 new units will soon be built. Plans filed with the city show three large evergreens and several smaller trees that are still standing on the lot are slated for removal.

Groups such as
Tree Action Seattle
point out that these new trees will take many years to mature — sacrificing years of carbon mitigation work when compared with existing mature trees — at a critical time for curbing planet-warming emissions.
Morris says the trees that will likely be cut down for this development might not seem like a big number.
""This really is death by a million cuts.""
He says trees have been cut down all over the city for years — thousands per year.
""At that scale, the cooling effect of the trees is diminished,"" says Morris, ""and the increased risk of death from excessive heat is heightened.""
Building codes aren't keeping up with climate change
Tree loss is not limited to Seattle. It's happening in
dozens of cities
across the country, from Portland, Ore., to Charleston, W.Va., and Nashville, Tenn., says Portland State University geography professor Vivek Shandas. ""If we don't take swift and very direct action with conservation of trees, of existing canopy, we're going to see the entire canopy shrink,"" Shandas says.
Sponsor Message
He says current municipal codes don't adequately address the implications of climate change. The Pacific Northwest, Shandas says, should be preparing for increasingly hot summers and more intense rain in winter. Trees are needed to provide shade and absorb runoff.
""So that development going in — if it's lot edge to lot edge — we're going to see an amplification of urban heat,"" Shandas says. ""We're going to see a greater amount of flooding in those neighborhoods.""
Climate change is intensifying hurricanes and raising sea levels while also playing a role in wildfires. Such extreme conditions are outpacing building codes, explains Shandas, and he fears this will happen in the Northwest too.
Shandas says how developers respond to the building codes that Seattle adopts over the next 20 to 50 years will determine the extent to which trees will help people here adapt to the warming climate.
That matters in Seattle, where the nights aren't cooling off nearly as much as they used to and where average daytime highs are getting hotter every year.
The Bryant Heights development is a modern mix of apartments, town houses, single-family homes and retail. Architects Ray and Mary Johnston worked with the developer to place 86 housing units where there were initially four.

A solution in the design
Architects Ray and Mary Johnston see part of the solution at another Seattle development they designed around an existing 40-year-old Scotch pine.
The Boulders development, near Seattle's Green Lake Park, transformed a single-family lot into a complex with nine town homes. The developer added mature trees he salvaged from other developments — transplanting them strategically to add texture and cooling to the landscaping.
Mary Johnston says building with trees in mind could also help people's pocketbooks. Boulders, she says, is an example. ""Since these units have air conditioning, those costs are going to be lower because you have this kind of cooler environment,"" she says. Ray Johnston says places like this shady urban oasis should be incentivized in city codes, especially as climate change continues.
""Would you rather be living here with the shade we have ... or would you rather be in a much more urban, treeless, shadeless environment, where you can't hang out outside?"" he asks.

stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
Weeks after wildfires
burned more than 16,000 homes and buildings
around Los Angeles this winter, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered Congress a grim view of America's insurance markets.
Premiums across the U.S. have jumped 24% on average in the past few years,
according to the Consumer Federation of America
, in part because climate change is driving
more intense
storms, floods and wildfires. Insurers and banks have already retreated from some of the riskiest parts of the U.S., Powell told lawmakers, like coastal communities and areas prone to blazes, including parts of California.

""If you fast-forward 10 or 15 years,""
Powell said
, ""there are going to be regions of the country where you can't get a mortgage.""
Climate
How climate change could cause a home insurance meltdown
The consequences of that kind of meltdown would be profound. People
need insurance to get a mortgage
to buy a house. If people can't get mortgages, property values fall. That strains local governments, which depend on property taxes — linked to home values — to fund public services like police and firefighters. As insurers drop customers in high-risk areas, a lot of Americans have been pushed onto
expensive state-run plans with limited coverage
. That means homeowners who lose insurance often struggle after disasters to rebuild or move.
""Everything has a price,"" says Ben Keys, a real estate and finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And so, it's not that areas become uninhabitable. It's that it's so wildly unaffordable to find insurance that only the very wealthiest people could afford to live there — to bear those kinds of risks themselves.""
For insurers, the bill for disasters keeps growing. One way to lower the cost is for homeowners and communities to better protect themselves from storms and fires by investing in things like fortified roofs and by thinning forest vegetation. That kind of work has already started. However, insurers rarely consider what has been done to make a property more resilient when deciding to offer or renew coverage, says Dave Jones, California's former insurance commissioner and the director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at UC Berkeley Law.

""Insurance is the climate canary in the coal mine, and the canary is gasping for breath right now,"" Jones says. Investments that help communities endure more extreme weather are ""a path to keep insurance available,"" he says. ""But the insurers need to account for it in their modeling. They're not.""

The amount of money insurers have paid out when extreme weather damages or destroys property has grown by between 5% and 7% annually in recent years,
according to Swiss Re
, a major reinsurer, which essentially sells insurance to insurance companies. If that trend holds, the industry will face close to $145 billion of insured losses globally in 2025, Swiss Re said in an April report. The Los Angeles wildfires alone inflicted around $40 billion of insured losses, the firm said.
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
Why knowing your neighbors can be an important climate solution
Disaster costs are rising for several reasons. People
continue to move
to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to forested areas prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. When homes get damaged or destroyed, inflation has made it more expensive to rebuild. All the while, the rising temperatures that fuel more extreme weather are caused primarily by burning fossil fuels that
insurance companies themselves continue to underwrite and invest in
.
Insurers have responded by increasing their prices to reflect the growing risks. That has raised insurance costs for homeowners and would-be homebuyers across the United States. In some places, including parts of California, Florida and North Carolina, insurers have gone further,
dropping customers
to shield themselves from ballooning losses.
Almost 2 million Americans had their home insurance policies dropped between 2018 and 2023, with the biggest impact in places at highest risk of disasters,
according to Keys
, of the University of Pennsylvania.

Some Los Angeles homes made it through the firestorm. Here's how
""We have an insurance-availability challenge that we're facing in some states, as well as growing affordability concerns,"" says Karen Collins, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group.
Insurance experts, industry representatives and consumer advocates interviewed by NPR largely agree that to shore up insurance markets, homes and communities have to become more resilient. That means they have to be located and built to better survive the extreme weather being amped up by climate change. But there's deep disagreement about how that should happen.

Who's responsible for making homes and communities more resilient?
Consumer and industry advocates say everyone bears responsibility to make housing more resilient: homeowners and communities, insurers, and local, state and federal lawmakers. But getting the different players to agree and take action gets tricky.

May Senate hearing
on home insurance that everyone talks about protecting communities when disasters happen, but then the issue is forgotten until the next catastrophe.

Faced with rising temps, Las Vegas is embracing a simple climate solution: More trees
""We've got to stop talking about resiliency and then you go home, you get political pushback, you don't do it,"" Tillis said. ""We need local and state officials to have the courage to tell their communities what they need to do to be more resilient. And the federal government needs to reward those who will, and deny funding for those who don't.""
Alex Epstein, a fossil fuel advocate at the same hearing, offered a different view: Preparing for disasters should be the homeowner's responsibility. And insurers should charge whatever they think is appropriate. The idea, Epstein said, is that if premiums skyrocket, it signals to the public where it's safe to live and what people need to do to protect themselves.
""You just need to allow total freedom of insurance markets to act in response to risk,"" Epstein said.
But just letting insurers raise prices for something most Americans have to purchase for homeownership isn't a solution, says Douglas Heller, insurance director at the Consumer Federation of America.
""You can't require people to buy something and then make it impossible for them to afford it,"" Heller says.

Industry-funded
grants are available in Alabama
to help pay for fortified roofs. And homeowners in a number of states
can qualify for insurance discounts
if they

Among the places hardest hit by insurance market turmoil is Lake County, California. Located about 130 miles north of San Francisco, more than 5% of the area's housing stock has burned in wildfires in the past decade, Jessica Pyska, a county supervisor,
said at the May Senate hearing
on insurance markets. The loss of more than 2,000 homes has been especially devastating in a county where residents are
older and poorer
than the
national average
. Still, Lake County has managed to become ""a model for disaster mitigation and community preparedness,"" Pyska told lawmakers.

Homeowners have installed fire-resistant roofs and noncombustible siding. Pyska said vegetation has also been cleared to create what's called defensible space around homes and fuel breaks to protect critical infrastructure.
But despite those efforts, ""we continue to be crushed by the insurance crisis plaguing our nation,"" Pyska said at the hearing. Insurance options in Lake County keep dwindling — the area had one of the country's
highest rates of insurance nonrenewal
in 2023. And residents who can find coverage have seen premiums double or triple, she said. As a result, new housing development has stalled, and more homes sit vacant because buyers can't get insurance.
""We are doing as much as we can right now,"" Pyska said, ""and everything is on the line.""

Is anyone trying to help communities like Lake County?
That's exactly what a group of homeowners, insurance experts and environmentalists is trying to do in the forest of Northern California.
In the Sierra Nevada, a homeowners association called Tahoe Donner said this year that it had convinced an insurer to provide
coverage that accounts for the community's efforts to reduce threats from wildfires
, including by thinning trees and
conducting prescribed burns
.
""We convinced an insurer, based on our demonstration that forest management reduces risk, to write insurance in an area in the middle of the forest where other insurers are not writing,"" says Jones of UC Berkeley Law, who owns property in Tahoe Donner.

But it's just a first step. The policy covers only the association's forested and recreational land — not homes — and it's still ""incredibly challenging"" for residents there to get insurance, says Annie Rosenfeld, Tahoe Donner's general manager.
However, Rosenfeld says the policy should serve as a test case for the home insurance industry.
""For [insurers], they need to have some assurance that not only you've hardened your home, but the community has done that larger, broad-scale risk mitigation — [and] that we can quantify it,"" says Jason Hajduk-Dorworth, Tahoe Donner's director of administrative services and a former fire chief in Santa Cruz, California.

If insurers refuse to account for those kinds of initiatives, then Jones says state lawmakers should force the issue. He pointed to a law that Colorado Gov. Jared Polis
signed in May
requiring insurers that use risk models to consider actions that homeowners and communities take to protect themselves — including home hardening and forest management — when they assess the risk that a property will burn in a wildfire.

What do insurers say?
Collins, of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, disputes that insurers ignore investments that homeowners and communities are making to protect themselves.
Battered by surging costs, insurers have been regrouping, Collins says, limiting how much coverage they can provide in certain markets.
""It's not a matter of [investments in resilience] not being recognized,"" Collins says. ""It's a matter of each company is in a different place with what their capacity is to lean into the market.""
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
How climate change is reshaping life on the Mighty Mississippi
Once insurers are in a position again to grow their business in those areas, ""you better believe that they're going to be looking at what are the most attractive risks,"" Collins adds. ""And if your home has been mitigated and shows clearly that it has taken steps to reduce the likelihood or extent of damage, it is going to be more attractive.""
An industry-backed group working on resilience is the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. Michael Newman, the group's general counsel, told Congress that when homeowners make verifiable, science-based investments to reduce risk, ""insurers will pay attention.""
But that's not translating into action, says Jones, of UC Berkeley Law. ""The industry is well aware of the risk-reduction benefits of home hardening, defensible space and landscape-scale forest treatment,"" he says. ""What's frustrating is that so far, except for what we've done with this insurance product [at Tahoe Donner], it's not being accounted for.""
Sponsor Message
The question, then, is how to encourage more of those kinds of arrangements. Susan Crawford, a senior fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, doubts state legislation forcing the industry's hand will be effective.
Insurers have plenty of places to do business, Crawford says, and ""it may not be in their interest to spend money to differentiate among communities that have invested in particular ways.""
Ultimately, there would need to be a sort of grand bargain between the public and private sectors, she says. If states and localities strengthen building codes and land-use policies, for example, insurers could help obtain government grant funding to aid lower-income homeowners in making the necessary upgrades to their property. Then, Crawford says, insurers would be encouraged to offer more attractive coverage in that area.
So far, though, there haven't been enough incentives — or pressure — to hammer out that kind of deal. State and local officials face blowback when they call for measures that could make communities more resilient, because they often cost constituents money. Meanwhile, insurers don't think it's their job to push for building-code and land-use reform, Crawford says. And housing developers worry about changes that could drive up home prices and hurt demand.
Workers with JAS Builders and Payne Construction Services raise a home with jacks and framing material in May in Treasure Island, Florida.

Are there limits to how much communities and insurers can adapt to climate risks?
There are limits, according to Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz, a German financial company with a big insurance business. And those limits are approaching fast.
""The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay,"" Thallinger wrote in a
March LinkedIn post
that went viral in climate and insurance circles. As temperatures keep rising, ""adaptation itself becomes economically unviable.""
That leaves one option, Thallinger said: Reduce heat-trapping emissions by burning less fossil fuel or by capturing climate pollution before it's released into the atmosphere.

That same month, in an article
in the journal
Nature
about soaring insurance costs, Scott St. George, head of weather and climate research at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson, also concluded that drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential.
Insurers talk a lot about raising premiums so they can return to risky areas and operate profitably, ""and I feel like that overlooks the aspect of the problem that the issues will still be here next year and the year after that,"" St. George told NPR.
""I think we need to be up-front with ourselves and with the next generation,"" St. George said, ""that this is a very hard problem to solve without getting to the root of things.""

stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
Earthaven Ecovillage is a community of around 100 full-time residents tucked away in  the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina. In late September, this idyllic place with its modest homes, babbling creeks and bumpy country roads was rocked as Hurricane Helene swept into the Carolinas, dropping torrential rainfall and bringing high winds. Across the state, more than 100 people died, and billions of dollars in property was damaged.
However, unlike other places such as Asheville, N.C.,
Earthaven
was relatively unscathed.

The power briefly went down when the village's hydroelectric system was temporarily damaged. Residents quickly implemented their backup solar system. The main road also washed out in places, and fallen trees made it impassable. But the community was able to quickly clear the blocked roads and make repairs because the village had chain saws and tractors. The residents also produce much of their food — fruits, vegetables and livestock. So no one went hungry. Few buildings suffered damage, and no one was badly injured.
""We got lucky,"" said Earthaven resident Brandon Greenstein, who has lived in the village for 26 years. ""But we also made a plan to be prepared for unforeseen events.""
Zev Friedman and Chloe Vieira relax on their porch. Earthaven is organized in part around ecology and sustainability principles like permaculture and building with natural materials. It's also self-governed, and residents are required to cooperate. That all helps when it comes to withstanding big storms.

This collaborative spirit — neighbors knowing neighbors and sharing resources in emergency situations as well as everyday life — is an important solution in a world of worsening climate disasters.
""There's a lot of
evidence
that shows that the stronger a community's social cohesion is, the better chances they have of resilience from climate hazards,"" said Rishi Sugla, a  climate resilience scientist at the University of Washington. ""Close-knit communities tend to share resources like transportation, information and caregiving during climate-fueled hazards. And all of these things can help buffer the impact.""

A community comes together
Established in 1994 on 329 acres of land about 45 minutes southeast of Asheville, Earthaven Ecovillage is partly organized around ecological principles such as building with natural materials and practicing permaculture — the development of sustainable and self-sufficient agricultural ecosystems. It's also self-governed, and residents are required to cooperate in decision-making, village maintenance and other processes.

5 simple (and cheap) things to make your house use less energy
Organized in hamletlike clusters dotted between the trees, Earthaven's homes range from small, rustic dwellings to modern, multilevel residences. Some people live on their own, while others opt for cohousing. There are also community spaces for meetings and other gatherings. The village is a bit like the Shire from
The Lord of the Rings
. There's even a house built into the hillside with a round blue-and-green door known to locals as ""the Hobbit House.""
Earthaven got away relatively lightly after Hurricane Helene, but parts of the ecovillage were rendered inaccessible by flooding and fallen trees.

Earthaven is among hundreds of ecovillages throughout North America, designed to minimize their impact on the environment. There are more than 1,200 established ecovillages around the globe. They come in different shapes and sizes and offer a variety of sustainability practices. The
Greater World Earthship Community
near Taos, N.M., for example, features off-the-grid homes made out of recycled materials such as old tires. Findhorn Ecovillage, a
63-year-old community in Scotland
, is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030.

"" There are ecovillages that are made up of a lot of semi-well-to-do hippies,"" said Daniel Greenberg, co-director of the Foundation for Intentional Community. ""But the bigger point is we are hitting a wall as a species, right? I see ecovillages as beta test centers. They're laboratories for how all of us can live in greater harmony with the planet.""
Amy Belanger sits inside her Earthaven home, which is known as ""the Hobbit House"" because it's built into a hillside and has a quaint round door. The home was among the very few at Earthaven damaged during Hurricane Helene. A tree hit her roof, and the two upper levels of her home were mangled. Though some of her fellow community members helped pull the tree off, the house is still unlivable at the moment.

The residents of Earthaven see themselves in this way. "" It's a social experiment,"" said Earthaven's Greenstein. ""Can we help each other to meet our needs and meet them so that we can live in a harmonious way?""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, residents pulled together on many fronts.
Rachel Fee, a farmer who has lived at the ecovillage for eight years, did a lot of cooking in the weeks following Hurricane Helene. ""I ran a kitchen on whatever kind of disparate food items we had and fed a hundred people,"" Fee said. The residents even held a big pig roast about a week after the storm.

Monique Mazza, a licensed practitioner of naturopathic medicine who came to Earthaven nine years ago, set up a health and wellness clinic. ""I brought whatever I had medically, including enough stuff to start an IV if we had to,"" she said.
Andy Bosley, who has lived at Earthaven for 23 years, put his electrician and handyman skills to work by monitoring Earthaven's power systems. He's also good at keeping a level head, and so he took charge of community meetings. ""It's sort of like being prepared, but not being a prepper and hoarding everything and having guns, and 'I've got a year's supply of stuff and you can't touch it,'"" Bosley said. "" Really, we rely on each other collectively.""
Earthaveners try to be as self-sustainable as possible. The community produces much of its own power and food. The food stores and solar power were particularly handy during Hurricane Helene and in its aftermath. The storm, for example, damaged their hydroelectric system, knocking out power, but they had solar as a backup.

Collectivity as a climate solution
Collaborative efforts are not uncommon at ecovillages.
""Ecovillages are good at sharing resources, being very connected and knowing who has the tools and the skills that are needed for any given moment,"" said Allyson Quinlan, the co-author of a 2024 Global Ecovillage Network
report
looking at the climate resilience of ecovillages around the world. Quinlan is the executive director of
Resilience Alliance
, a group that researches the resilience of social-ecological systems. The Global Ecovillage Network collaborated with Quinlan's organization on the study.
The report examined 20 ecovillages in 18 countries to find out how well these communities could cope if the planet warmed by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit). The Earth is
currently on track
to warm even more than that by the end of the century unless humans dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions.

This city is exploring an unconventional solution to water scarcity: sewage
While areas for improvement include ramping up early warning systems and emergency plans, the report found a strong sense of social cohesion, self-organization and participation to be among the greatest strengths of ecovillages when it comes to their ability to cope with the impacts of climate change. ""There's a lot we can learn from ecovillages about supporting one another and connecting as a community,"" Quinlan said.
Earthaven's Council Hall is the main meeting place for residents. The community is self-governing, so many decisions get made in this yurtlike building. ""This building was designed to accommodate our governance council,"" said Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron. ""It's a 35-foot circle, and that number was basically brought forth from data that suggested that at that size, people in a circle can see the facial expressions of the people across the circle. Once it gets bigger than that, then you start to lose that connection.""

Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron grew up in Michigan and wanted to start an intentional community built on anticonsumerist, collectivist, permaculture-based principles long before Earthaven came into being. He was already living near the North Carolina site that would eventually become Earthaven when he met a group of people with similar plans. They went in together on a $440,000 tract of heavily forested land and started clearing it to build housing and communal spaces.
Sponsor Message
Before physically establishing the community, they laid down its guiding principles in writing. "" We agreed that we would do permaculture, natural building and we would practice consensus,"" said co-founder Arjuna da Silva. Da Silva is talking about a form of collective decision-making where everyone has to agree before moving ahead.
"" We had an explicit agreement that we signed that was that we're not allowed to hold grudges,"" Caron said. ""We're not allowed to continue to have a conflict that you don't work on."" Earthaven has in recent years modified its approach to self-governance; now an 85% majority has to agree for a plan to proceed.
Conflict resolution training is offered to anyone who stays at Earthaven and is required for anyone who wants to become a member. A resident can become a member after living at the ecovillage for anywhere between one and several years while the community and the individual decide whether they are a good fit.
Caron said people in his community model collaborative behaviors because togetherness is one of Earthaven's core principles. ""It's not a spiritual ideology that's holding it together,"" he said. ""It's the foundation of that cooperative culture that we've actually created.""
The cooperative culture shows up in many aspects of life at Earthaven today, from hashing out disagreements at community meetings to the regular Friday night music jams. And it showed up in the residents' response during the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron was living in the area in the 1990s when he met the people with whom he would go on to create the ecovillage. "" The original founding vision was to model a village, kind of like going back to an earlier pattern so that we can regroup as a species to go forward, basically. That's what Earthaven really is — a social experiment more than a physical experiment.""

The downside to interconnectedness
The interconnectedness also comes with downsides when dealing with the impacts of climate change.
Lack of diversity is a big one for Earthaven. While there is socioeconomic range, the residents are largely white. It has been that way since the beginning.
Resident Chloe Vieira is concerned about the lack of racial diversity. ""If we have a monochromatic set of people, we're gonna get a certain answer,"" said Vieira. "" But if we have a diversity of backgrounds, then people are gonna be looking at that question from multiple angles and we're just gonna come up with a better answer.""

Resident Zev Friedman is worried about how whiteness can lead to patterns that cause gentrification. ""A gentrifying ecovillage leans towards insulating us from what's going on in the world,"" Friedman said. ""And therefore being less willing to take on truly transformational ideas and actions around what it would mean for us to play a significant role in true climate adaptation.""

Residents NPR spoke with said they want Earthaven to grow in size and be more diverse. There are advantages and disadvantages to this aspiration when it comes to climate change.
""If it's done well, integrating lots of new people can really increase resilience because you have a bigger and more varied pool of people, skills and capacities, and can leverage a greater collective intelligence,"" said Anna Kovasna, the strategic lead for community resilience at the Global Ecovillage Network. ""But it can also lead to splits and conflicts. So it tests the shared vision and purpose, which is really important to ecovillages.""
Earthaven's approximately 100 residents share an idyllic forested landscape. It has become more expensive to buy land and start an ecovillage from scratch since the 1990s, when Earthaven was founded. But co-founder Paul Caron says the ideals of communal living offer lessons to everyone — even those of us living in urban environments.

Looking outward
Part of Earthaven's effort to increase its diversity and potential size involves increasing public awareness of the village and its sustainable practices. It does this by running public tours and workshops on topics like climate resilience, permaculture and solar energy, mostly through its on-site
School of Integrated Living
.
""The main thing is to get people to come here, see what it is and go, 'Hmm, what could I do in my life to develop something like this?'"" Earthaven co-founder Caron said.
Caron said even people who have no interest in starting an ecovillage — which has become increasingly expensive and difficult to do in the United States owing to high land prices and strict regulatory frameworks — or even joining an existing one, can learn how to live more sustainable lives right in their own neighborhoods from places like Earthaven. He said he wants communities everywhere to work collectively to be more resilient when it comes to adapting to climate change.
""Everybody can't move to the country and found an ecovillage in the woods. But everybody can join with their neighbors and figure out ways to cooperate,"" Caron said. ""Like, if you've got three suburban lawns right next to each other, you don't need but one lawnmower. It's as simple as that.""
The cooperative spirit of Earthaven's residents saw the community through Hurricane Helene. But the residents say there is still work to be done to make themselves even more resilient.

has spent multiple summers hiking six or seven miles to a remote corner of Yosemite National Park where she has camped out next to ponds and lakes.
""At night,"" Woodruff says, ""you look out, it's pitch black, but you have the moon reflecting off the water.""
Soon, however, the dark quiet would be broken by the telltale sound of an American bullfrog. ""Once one starts, another one starts, and then it becomes this big deafening chorus of bullfrog calls happening at once,"" she says.
And when Woodruff, who's an ecology PhD candidate at UC Davis, flashed her headlamp over the water, she says a constellation of eyes blinked back at her, reflecting the light.

""The bullfrogs were there by the thousands upon thousands
at just one given site,"" she recalls.
These frogs, however, were not supposed to be there. Beginning in the late 1800s, they were introduced outside of their native range in eastern North America, often as a food source for people. The result has been a global explosion of the bullfrog — with dire consequences for local wildlife.

The result was the striking recovery of the Northwestern pond turtle, California's only native freshwater pond turtle species, at a couple of remote bodies of water within Yosemite National Park.
Giant froggy mouths
The American bullfrog is massive — ""maybe the size of a grapefruit in your hand,"" says Woodruff. ""And they will literally just feed on anything that fits into their mouth.""
That includes salamanders, snakes, frogs, small birds and rodents, and pond turtle hatchlings, which Woodruff and her labmates sometimes refer to as ""'little cookies,' because they're so cute.""

The national park previously conducted a massive bullfrog eradication effort in Yosemite Valley — in part to save the pond turtles — but it was too late. The turtles couldn't stage a comeback.

""The only time that we are coming across young, small turtles is when they are popping up in these bullfrog stomachs,"" says Woodruff. ""So you have no younger individuals coming up through the ranks.""
Woodruff wanted to know: If the bullfrogs from these backcountry ponds were removed while there were still older turtles present, might the population show signs of recovery?
Resurrecting a food web
To answer that question, Woodruff and her colleagues conducted a combination of night surveys to remove the adults and day surveys to go after bullfrog egg masses.
Across two sites, she estimates they removed some 16,000 bullfrogs, amounting to a near-complete eradication.
And after several years of removal, ""we came across our first couple of small pond turtle hatchlings and juveniles swimming out in the environment,"" says Woodruff. ""So once we removed that heavy bullfrog presence, those younger turtles were free from that predation and able to grow up.""

And Gregory says keeping bullfrogs from reinvading an area requires near constant vigilance, which means wildlife managers will have to be strategic.
""Maybe parts of the population are really important for genetic diversity,"" Gregory says. ""Or it's high-quality habitat, maybe that's where we really focus our efforts.""
Meanwhile, in Yosemite, there's been a partial return to an earlier soundscape.
""As the bullfrog population went down,"" says Woodruff, ""you started to hear some of our native chorus frogs again. They're the ones that have this iconic Hollywood ribbit sound.""

Roughly 163 million people experience obsessive-compulsive disorder and its associated cycles of obsessions and compulsions. They have unwanted intrusive thoughts, images or urges; they also do certain behaviors to decrease the distress caused by these thoughts.
In movies and TV shows, characters with OCD are often depicted washing their hands or obsessing about symmetry.

In her time practicing medicine, she's seen many permutations of the condition, and has realized how often people with OCD, and even mental health care providers, may not recognize the symptoms. Once patients are diagnosed, some won't respond to treatments like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or exposure and response prevention. That's why, in this encore episode, Rodriguez looks to include more populations in research and find new ways to treat OCD, like ketamine.

Organizers say more than 340 staffers on the NIH's sprawling campus in Bethesda, Md., just outside Washington, D.C., sent the document to NIH Director

appealing to him to protect the agency. They say the Trump administration is putting politics ahead of academic freedom.

RFK Jr. says COVID shots no longer recommended for kids, pregnant women
Before taking over at the NIH, Bhattacharya was known for helping write the controversial
Great Barrington Declaration
, which questioned lockdowns and other public health measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Bethesda Declaration, the scientists say the Trump administration has ""forced NIH, under [Bhattacharya's] watch"" to ""politicize"" research, ""stigmatize"" studies about health disparities, and cut research into COVID-19, long COVID, the health impacts of climate change, and medical issues related to gender and intersex people among other important areas.
""For staff across the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we dissent to administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe,"" the declaration says. ""The life-and-death nature of our work demands that changes be thoughtful and vetted. We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.""
The document is notable because most NIH employees are afraid to publicly criticize the new administration publicly for fear of losing their jobs or their funding — a situation the declaration calls a ""culture of fear and suppression."" The document was signed by 92 employees who revealed their names.
""Standing up in this way is a risk, but I am much more worried about the risks of not speaking up,"" said a statement by Jenna Norton, one of the lead organizers of the declaration and a program officer at the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""If we don't speak up, we allow continued harm to research participants and public health in America and across the globe. If we don't speak up, we allow our government to curtail free speech, a fundamental American value.""

In a written response, Bhattacharya said the Bethesda Declaration ""has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.""
But some of the scientists who signed the letter described a sense of despair and anguish at the NIH, which is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research.
""It's a horror show. We're under attack in every way all the time,"" says
Sarah Kobrin
, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for more than 21 years. ""We're told we're worthless. We're told we're cheats. This is probably the most stressful period of my entire life. It's a thousand cuts, a thousand cuts. They're breaking things that won't be repairable.""
Kobrin, chief of NCI's Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, stresses that she was speaking on her own behalf and not as part of the NIH.
""This is an extinction-level event for biomedical research and global public health, and it's just wrong not to say something and not to try to right this ship,"" says
Ian Morgan
, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine.
More than 40 scientists from outside the NIH, including 21 Nobel laureates, also initially signed a
separate letter
supporting the Bethesda Declaration. In addition, more than 500 signed the letter Monday morning after the document was made public.
""We commend the NIH staff who have come forward with the 'Bethesda Declaration' to share concerns in the spirit of academic freedom, for the good of all,"" the letter states.
""We urge NIH and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership to work with NIH staff to return the NIH to its mission and to abandon the strategy of using NIH as a tool for achieving political goals unrelated to that mission.""

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to

Our homes use
a lot
of energy. The huge amounts of energy used to operate buildings result in
more than a fourth of the world's planet heating carbon dioxide pollution
.
One home climate solution is to switch to appliances that make less pollution, like switching from a gas furnace to an efficient heat pump.
But it turns out you don't have to buy a new appliance to cool or heat your home in a more climate-friendly way. Climate solutions for reducing home energy use can be extremely simple — and sometimes even free, says

These 5 big purchases can save energy — and money — at home
A more energy-efficient home often comes down to
gaining less heat
in hot months and
losing less heat
in cold months, Aviv says. Here are five simple solutions to reduce your home's climate pollution, make your home more resilient to global warming and reduce your energy bills.
Open a window
Aviv says we're so used to thinking about thermostats or turning on the air conditioning as the main way to control our home's temperature. But many of us live in temperate environments, at least for part of the year.
In the spring or in the evenings, instead of turning on the air conditioner — which not only uses electricity but releases potent planet-heating gases called hydrofluorocarbons — Aviv has another idea.
""A lot of the time,"" she says, ""all you need to do is to actually open your windows to be comfortable.""
Life Kit
Take on climate change at home and cut carbon emissions. Here's how
Even better, Aviv says? Open up two windows to create a cross breeze if you have cross-facing windows in your home. Researchers find that using natural ventilation can translate into huge energy savings —
sometimes as much as 45% depending on your local climate
.
Don't forget ceiling fans
Aviv thinks not enough people use ceiling fans. "" I think that a lot of people can install ceiling fans and don't even think about it anymore in the age of air conditioning,"" Aviv says. ""A lot of the time, you don't need air conditioning if you have a ceiling fan.""
Sponsor Message
While ceiling fans cannot lower the air temperature, they can provide increased cooling by moving the air around, which may be enough in certain climates.
Life Kit
Improve the indoor air quality in your home
Fans use a lot less energy than air conditioning. Using ceiling fans compared to air conditioners can
reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 76%
, according to researchers in Australia.
If you have a ceiling fan and aren't using it, try turning it on. Bonus points if you also can open a few windows.
Make your roof reflective
The roof is often the part of your home that receives the most sun. That sunlight hitting the roof gets absorbed in the building and translates to heat inside the house.
That's why Aviv says it might be worth looking into what's known as a ""reflective roof.""
""Reflective roofs are actually one of the easiest retrofits you can do in a house,"" she says.
A lot of roofs are covered with black or darker-color finishes, which absorb the sun's heat. With a roof coated with a white or a silvery color, the solar energy gets reflected away from the house instead of absorbed inside.
That way, Aviv says, ""you are alleviating a lot of the cooling load that your house needs.""
Less need for cooling with air conditioners also means
less money spent on utility bills
. Aviv suggests talking to a roofer who knows about different reflective paints that can help reflect sunlight.
Put your shades outside, not inside
In places that get very hot, you might want to think about installing shades on the outside of your house, not the inside, says
Daniel Barber
, professor of architectural theory at  Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
Here's why. If you have a blind or curtain inside your house, behind your windowpane,  then the sunlight coming in brings the heat inside.
Sponsor Message
If you close the blind or curtain, Barber says, ""You're basically creating a sort of a buffer, a sort of pillow of heat between the curtain and the window.""
That's why climate-minded designers are installing blinds or shades on the outside of apartments and homes, not on the inside. That way the heat stays outside your house.
Keeping the heat out using shades is a tradition dating back centuries, Barber says. In Mediterranean places like Egypt, Tunisia or Southern Europe, people use wooden shutters to keep the heat on the exterior of a building, and not bring it inside.
Seal it up
It's a basic law of physics — thermodynamics, to be precise.  ""Heat always finds a way to escape through the easiest path,"" Aviv says.
That's why in cool months when you're heating your home, you want to make sure that heat isn't escaping your house into the outdoors. Or in hot months, if you have an air-conditioning system that brings in fresh air, you want to make sure heat is not entering your home through the cracks.
Aviv says to look for ""air leaks"" that usually occur in cracks around openings like windows and doors.
Nancy ""Nan"" Ma, assistant professor of architectural engineering at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute
in Massachusetts, explains that one solution is to upgrade your windows. But for something cheaper, you can do something called ""weather stripping."" That's using a type of tape or rubber around your window frame to seal the leaks. Weather-stripping materials often cost under $10, and you can buy them at the hardware store or online.

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to
stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
ST. GEORGE, Utah — Water scarcity, population growth and climate change are on a collision course in the American West.
That's clear in cities like St. George, a desert community surrounded by stunning red rock cliffs and mesas in Utah's southwest corner. The population is
booming
and climate change is making
heat more intense
and
rain less reliable
. But local leaders have a plan to stretch the area's water supply by turning to its sewage — a solution that could help other drought-stricken cities, too.

That plan started with a simple math problem.
""All the water has been used. It's been called for. But yet, we have one of the fastest-growing communities in the Western United States,"" said Zach Renstrom, general manager of the Washington County Water Conservancy District in St. George.
Washington County has one of the nation's fastest-growing populations in recent years. ""We're looking at hundreds of thousands of people moving to our community, and we have no extra water for them,"" said Zach Renstrom of the Washington County Water Conservancy District. The county expects that reusing its wastewater will provide more than half of the additional water it will need to sustain growth into the 2040s.

""So, we're looking at hundreds of thousands of people moving to our community,"" said Renstrom, ""and we have no extra water for them.""
As recently as 2021, this sun-drenched outdoor recreation hub was the fastest-growing metro area in the U.S. The local population, now just over 200,000, has more than doubled since 2002. The University of Utah projects it could double again by 2050.
That's where the sewage plan comes in.
""If you want to know the true value of water, that occurs when the well goes dry,"" Zach Renstrom said. Despite the high price tag of building wastewater recycling plants, smaller communities like St. George believe it may be the best way to sustain their water supplies into a hotter, drier future.

At a construction site just east of St. George, Renstrom walked toward a maze of rebar and concrete that's slated to become a new wastewater reclamation plant by the end of 2025. Once complete, it'll take effluent from local kitchens and bathrooms and clean it with screens, bacteria and UV light.
Climate
What biologists see from the shores of the drying Great Salt Lake
In the near term, the treated wastewater will be sprayed on lawns and farm fields. But that will free up water for homes, too, because the county currently uses some of its drinking water for outdoor irrigation. Within two decades, Renstrom expects the district will start sending the clean water from its reclamation plants directly into the drinking supply.
Reusing water that would have otherwise flowed downstream to Lake Mead — the nation's largest reservoir — is the centerpiece of the district's
long-term water plan
. But it will come at a steep cost: over a billion dollars.

""Traditionally, I would say that you would have to be a very large, large, large municipality to be able to afford that massive infrastructure,"" Renstrom said. ""But now we're getting to the point where, even small communities like us, it's our only option.""
Golfers play a round on the manicured landscape of a Washington County golf course. In this desert climate, irrigated grass can be a significant strain on the local water supply. That's why the county has introduced incentives and regulations in an effort to increase water conservation.

The tall task facing cities in the West
St. George's quandary is a microcosm of the challenges cities face across the Western U.S. as overuse and drought strain the Colorado River and the basin's seven states
fight
over how the river's water gets distributed in the future.
Climate
The Colorado River rarely reaches the sea. Here's why
Expanding wastewater reuse operations regionwide could go a long way toward easing that pressure, said UCLA water researcher Noah Garrison. There just needs to be a lot more of it.
""One of the reasons why we need to be investing in wastewater recycling now is that this isn't some hypothetical future concern we're dealing with,"" Garrison said. ""We already are seeing water scarcity and water stress in all of these regions, and developing out wastewater recycling does take time.""
While other places like
Los Angeles
,
Phoenix
and
San Francisco
recycle a lot of their sewage already, Utah reuses
less than 1%
of its wastewater statewide. A recent
analysis
Garrison co-wrote suggested that if all basin states start reusing more than half of their wastewater — as Nevada and Arizona already do — it could make up for around a third of the region's expected water shortfall.
A visit to St. George's main water source, the Virgin River, highlights the urgency.
This waterway carved the towering red rock canyon in nearby Zion National Park. But after a historically dry winter, the section snaking through St. George has become shallow enough to walk across without getting more than your ankles wet.
""This is it,"" district conservation manager Doug Bennett said as he motioned toward the meager flow. ""This is the lifeblood of the entire region.""
Before reaching the residents of St. George, the Virgin River runs through Zion National Park, attracting diverse wildlife and millions of tourists each year.

In addition to reusing water, St. George and neighboring communities have adopted conservation rules in recent years that nearly eliminate grass on new development. The district also
pays residents
up to $2 per square foot to rip out their irrigated lawns — a strategy other cities from
Denver
to
Fresno
to
Spokane
have tested, too.

The southwest Utah program has incentivized homeowners and businesses to remove
more than 2 million square feet
of grass since launching in late 2022. But Bennett knows it has a lot of room left to grow, especially among local
golf courses
. That's where the region's
record dry conditions
this year could help.
St. George and surrounding communities recently passed regulations that limit grass lawns around new housing. Changing the region's mindset about water conservation may present a challenge, but successful examples from Las Vegas and elsewhere offer hope. ""It proves what can be done and that it is doable,"" Doug Bennett said. ""You just need to get people mobilized behind the effort.""

""One of the biggest threats to implementing all these programs is complacency,"" Bennett said. ""A drought can be a big motivator for people to say, 'What can I do to help?'""
Making growth sustainable in a dry, hot, booming place like St. George may be a tall task, but Bennett believes it can work. He saw it in his previous job at the water district in Las Vegas.
The Virgin River is where the St. George area gets its water for drinking and irrigation. It's also a hub for outdoor recreation. Here, people cool off at the Virgin River Skimboard Park.

Bigger cities are proving the water-saving tech
Just 120 miles to the southwest, Las Vegas is St. George's glitzy neighbor, and it has been reusing wastewater on a large scale for decades.
At the Clark County Water Reclamation District's main plant, Strategic Services Manager Bud Cranor creaked open a tall, metal door. Behind it flowed some of the 100 million gallons of sewage this plant treats each day.
""Right here is all the poop from every casino, every business,"" Cranor said. ""It's like every little 12-year-old boy's dream is working at this place, because you get to make poop jokes all day.""
But for a city in the desert, it's no laughing matter.
""What we do here is absolutely vital to this valley's survival,"" he said.
Squeezing clean water from this sea of sludge has helped the Vegas metro population more than double in the past two decades. It now has nearly 2.4 million people. Conservation
efforts
have played a big role there, too. Even as Vegas welcomed hundreds of thousands of new residents, the area decreased its total water consumption — a concept known as
decoupling
.
Sponsor Message
As more communities work to ensure their residents have water for the future, Cranor believes what Vegas has accomplished can be a neon-glowing case study.
""That will become more and more of a priority as it becomes a scarcer resource,"" he said. ""So cities, if they're not already thinking about it, they're going to have to start thinking about it more.""
The Clark County Water Reclamation District's main plant in Las Vegas, Nevada, treats over 100 million gallons of sewage every day. It then releases clean water into the Las Vegas Wash, which flows to Lake Mead. ""This is the result of a lot of human ingenuity and creativity,"" Bud Cranor said, ""to figure out how to clean and treat this finite resource so that it can be reused and it can help people survive.""

What it might take to grow in the future
Now that Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other major cities have proven the concept of wastewater reuse, Newsha Ajami has seen a growing trend of smaller communities following their lead. She's a water researcher with Stanford University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
When it comes to scaling up reuse, Ajami said the technology is not the main limiting factor. Rather, ""it's often a policy problem or sort of governance structure that needs to change to embrace some of these solutions.""
Cities may face their own localized challenges, too. In St. George, one of the limiting factors is the need to
build additional reservoirs
that can store the water its reuse plants clean. Las Vegas sends its recycled water into massive Lake Mead, which is well under half-full as Western megadrought and overuse shrink large reservoirs across the West.
St. George homeowner Karen Goodfellow works on her backyard project to replace grass with water-efficient plants. The county hopes its program that pays residents to remove irrigated lawns will encourage more people to do the same.

Ultimately, Ajami said the extent to which wastewater reuse can allow a city to grow is up to its leaders, its budget and its willingness to adapt. For some communities, that may mean prioritizing pricey water infrastructure updates. She also envisions a future where reuse becomes decentralized, like a neighborhood having its own microplant or even in-home systems.
""You can do it smart,"" she said. ""For example, if you build new buildings, new homes, and say, 'OK, you know what? You're going to connect the shower water to toilets.'""
Ajami compares it to the adoption of solar panels on home roofs in recent years. As those become more common, they help a city reduce the pressure on its power grid. Expanding decentralized reuse could potentially do something comparable for a city's water supply.
Sponsor Message
""That is definitely the future,"" Ajami said. ""It might not be here now, but in the next 10-15 years, I can see more and more of that happening.""
The wastewater treatment plant being built near St. George is a sign of the changing times, too.
When Renstrom studied water management in engineering school 25 years ago, he said the biggest question about sewage was how to get rid of it.
""In my career, that has completely changed,"" Renstrom said, ""where now, people are fighting over this.""
Communities like his are counting on that sewage to sustain them into a hotter, drier future.
In St. George and across the Southwest, climate change is making extreme heat more intense and rainfall less reliable. The people in charge of managing local water supplies are taking note. ""Anybody here in the West that is not thinking about that, they're missing it,"" Renstrom said. ""Because we have to build an infrastructure now that's very adaptable to whatever happens.""

NICE, France — World leaders, scientists and officials gathered on Monday to open the third
United Nations Ocean Conference
and launch a global appeal to save the world's oceans, which scientists say are in bad health.
The presidents of France and Costa Rica launched the summit with speeches calling for bold action to address the myriad problems oceans face, including warming, rising seas, pollution — especially plastics — overfishing and the destruction of biodiversity and marine environments.
The summit's work actually began last week, when thousands of scientists from across the world descended on Nice to hammer out recommendations to give to policy makers.

The scientists met in large tents along Nice's colorful port, where azure waters sparkle under the Mediterranean buildings' pastel-colored façades. As the summit approached, research and scientific boats pulled into the harbor, including a giant, three-mast Norwegian tall ship.
Science skepticism
Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who served as special climate envoy in the Biden administration, opened the scientific conference.
""Never has your knowledge and expertise been more relevant than today, and never have we known - at least in the modern world — a time where the life's work of scientists is so openly scorned or ignored by those who claim to lead,"" said Kerry.
He mentioned no names, but the Trump administration's policies that conflict with scientific consensus and cut research funding have been on everyone's minds here. Glaringly absent are U.S. scientific agencies like NASA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Their scientists weren't allowed to attend the summit, say organizers.
However, Lisa Levin, a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, is in attendance, along with 140 American scientists from private institutions and universities.
""The main thing we see is the complete lack of U.S. federal scientists,"" says Levin. ""They have played a major role on almost all the issues being discussed in this conference so they are really missed. NOAA, especially, has long-term observations that are being threatened that the entire scientific community around the world depends on.""

""U.S. oceanography has always been a strong contributor to global science,"" says François Houllier, the CEO of
IFREMER
, the French marine science institute that brought the scientists together. ""There's only one global ocean, everything is connected. For that reason international cooperation is really something critical.""
A good example, says Houllier, is the
Argo Program
, which uses some 4,000 floats around the world to record ocean temperatures at all depths. That data is crucial to climate and weather predictions and understanding.
Deploying a float without stopping the ship requires special boxes to protect the floats. Here cross braces are assembled to protect the antenna on the RV Melville.

""If you don't have these, you don't know that the ocean is warming,"" said Houllier. ""If you don't know that the ocean is warming, you don't understand why the sea level is rising.""
Houllier says the United States provides about half of the floats. And their data, uploaded to satellites, is stored in two servers — one in France and one in the U.S. The Trump administration has announced
cuts
to funding at NOAA, which threatens U.S. participation in the program.
""And so what will happen in the coming years in the U.S. is very important,"" Houllier said. ""Will the U.S. be able to continue to contribute to this international global program or will they stop?""
Jeff Ardron, Africa oceans director with the Nature Conservancy, says this third U.N. ocean conference is taking on an urgency that the previous two did not have.
""There's a very quickly growing recognition and acceptance that the ocean issues are important and they need our attention,"" said Ardron.
The U.N. special envoy for the ocean Peter Thomson says the scientific evidence is undeniable.
""We're not talking anymore about what might be coming. It is coming,"" he said.
Speaking of fossil fuel emissions, Thomson said: ""We must acknowledge the fact that we have altered our system. We have engaged in a giant geoengineering project that we didn't even know we were doing, and we have succeeded in warming the planet,"" he said, explaining that 90% of the earth's warming is captured and held by the oceans.

""And of course, warming the planet is warming the ocean, and warming the ocean means sea level rise,"" he said.

Coastal mayors are worried
Hundreds of mayors from coastal cities have also shown up for the conference. They held their own coastal resilience
summit
over the weekend, at the invitation of Nice's Mayor Christian Estrosi.
The mayors hailed from Pacific islands and Norwegian fjord towns like Bergen. Norway has the world's second longest coastline.
""The challenges with the climate and the rising sea level cannot be solved alone,"" said Bergen's Mayor Marit Warncke. ""It requires cooperation beyond borders — cities, regions and countries with their civil society and technology developers must be involved.""
Many of the ocean's problems are linked to climate change, scientists emphasized. Among the proposals: greenhouse emissions must be reduced, and plastics must be used less. Some 8 million tons of plastic are dumped in the sea every year and those plastics are breaking down into particles known as nanoplastics which are absorbed into animal and human bloodstreams.
One part of the ocean that was previously thought untouched and stable — the deep sea — has actually warmed too. And for the first time it is getting a lot of attention.
""Our climate would be far too hot to live on if we didn't have the ocean and most people don't realize that most of the ocean is the deep sea,"" says Levin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""But it is still the great unknown.""
She says it is usually ignored in major discussions and policy negotiations. ""But a lot of the conversations here have been about the threats facing the deep sea.""
The biggest of those is deep-sea mineral mining and the idea of making the deep sea a dumping ground for unwanted carbon. While no deep-sea mineral mining has yet taken place, the Trump administration has given the
go-ahead
for it.

Scientists in Nice say the deep sea is still a place of great uncertainty and far too fragile to be tampered with. The Nature Conservancy's Ardron says any damage could take tens of thousands, if not millions, of years to repair.
Diva Amon is a marine scientist at the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
""My ask is for decision makers at the United Nations conference [to] take action,"" she said. ""For too long there has been inaction. Many people say we don't know enough, need much more science. Yes, you always need more science. But we have enough science to make informed decisions about many things. More than enough for global leaders to make the right decisions to save our oceans."""

, a long-term survey on the health and lifestyles of dogs in the United States. Their launch goal: Enroll 10,000 dogs. When a global pandemic hit soon after, it was suddenly a daunting task.
But it turned out that people were eager to sign up, since many of them were spending lots of time at home with their dogs.
Today, The Dog Aging Project has more than 50,000 companion dogs enrolled. Project scientists collect all sorts of data about them: their diet, exercise level, medications, demographics and environmental exposures.

Through the project, scientists like Virginia Tech veterinarian and data analyst
Audrey Ruple
hope to better understand what contributes to dog aging, how to ameliorate its effects and how to leverage the knowledge they gain into insights about human health and aging.
""Ultimately, I would really like to know what the right recipe is for a long, healthy life for our dog companions,"" says Ruple. ""What are the things that we can do to optimize health within that species? I do think that learning those keys in the dog population will help us in terms of figuring out what's the right combination of things for the human population as well.""

SpaceX is best known for its high-profile crewed missions to the International Space Station and its ambitious Starship program. But the U.S. has become increasingly reliant on the company for critical and sometimes secret space operations. This relationship is now jeopardized by the escalating feud between SpaceX founder Elon Musk and President Trump.
The ongoing dispute highlights the deep interdependence between the U.S. government and SpaceX. Trump has threatened to cut SpaceX's federal contracts. Musk fired back by saying that his company would decommission its Dragon capsule, which is currently America's only means of transportation to the space station. He later deleted the original tweet.
Sponsor Message
During the Obama administration, Lori Garver served as deputy administrator of NASA and she actively championed partnerships between the space agency and SpaceX. At that time, Musk's rocket company was struggling to prove it could reliably send satellites into orbit. Garver calls the war of words between Trump and Musk ""really disconcerting.""
Technology
What the Trump-Musk breakup may mean for SpaceX and Tesla
""When Elon shot back bringing SpaceX into it, I think that was strategically a mistake,"" she says. ""It just highlights for government leaders the risk in having a prime large aerospace and defense contractor run by one individual.""
During Garver's tenure at NASA, SpaceX was viewed as an underdog in the satellite launch business, trying to stand out against United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture formed to provide launch services to the government and comprising aerospace heavyweights Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
But SpaceX's powerful Falcon rockets changed that dynamic, according to Laura Forczyk, owner of the space consulting firm Astralytical. The big shift occurred when SpaceX put considerable money and effort into perfecting an innovative system to soft-land the rocket's booster stage for refurbishment and reuse. This innovation increased launch frequency and reduced costs, which made SpaceX more attractive to the Pentagon.
Forczyk said the Defense Department ""began to rely more on SpaceX because of that increased launch capacity as well as the lower bid when it came to launch contracts.""
Sponsor Message
Today, SpaceX dominates both the U.S. and global launch markets. According to
BryceTech
, a private analytics firm, SpaceX launched 83% of all spacecraft worldwide last year.
The Defense Department has also come to rely heavily on SpaceX's
Starlink
global satellite internet service, with about 50 military commands now using it, according to
Defense News.
In 2021, SpaceX also signed a
classified $1.8 billion contract
with the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office to launch a network of satellites designed to create a government-owned encrypted version of Starlink for military use on future battlefields.
Politics
From bromance to breakup: How Elon Musk and Donald Trump blew up
Tim Farrar, president of
TMF Associates
, a space consultancy, says the U.S. would find it challenging to move away from Starlink, which requires dozens of launches to put its network of satellites in orbit. While other companies aim to compete with Starlink for Defense Department business, ""it's proving very difficult for those others to catch up,"" he says.
Russia's war in Ukraine has highlighted the potential danger of having a single powerful individual like Musk in control of a critical technology such as Starlink. The SpaceX CEO has repeatedly threatened to cut off Kyiv's access to the satellite network.
Garver credits SpaceX with securing government contracts by consistently ""underbidding, overdelivering, performing, and beating out the competition."" She says during her time at NASA, the agency's approach was to award multiple contracts for the same mission to avoid overreliance on a single provider. Even so, Garver says, SpaceX,  ""got less money to do more — and went earlier, more often, and succeeded.""

That has meant that rocket company's Crew Dragon, originally intended as a backup to Boeing's Starliner for trips to Earth orbit, ended up leaping forward in development. It has since become NASA's main transport to the space station, while Starliner has struggled. On a crewed test mission last year, a malfunction with Starliner's thrusters forced a
months-long delay
in bringing two astronauts back from orbit.
The two ultimately came home aboard a SpaceX Dragon.

Garver says this situation validates NASA's multiple-contract strategy.
""It's why we have multiple cargo providers and why Boeing's Starliner, despite delays, still matters.""
If Musk were to stop making Dragon capsules available for flights to the space station, in theory, NASA might have to revert to relying on Russia to provide Soyuz rockets for transport, as it did for nine years following the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 until the first crewed SpaceX mission in 2020. But this could be risky given the current geopolitical environment, consultant Forczyk says.

A lunar-lander version of SpaceX's Starship is at the center of efforts to return astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972 as part of NASA's Artemis program. Nevertheless, Starship has already experienced multiple launch and reentry failures, making it unlikely to meet NASA's goal of landing on the Moon in 2027 as part of the Artemis 3 mission. The giant rocket has yet to reach orbit, let alone complete the complex refueling operation necessary for a journey to the Moon and eventually Mars.
Meanwhjile, Musk has expressed doubts about the desirability of returning to the Moon. In a
post on X
, he called the moon mission a ""distraction,"" suggesting that traveling to Mars — a long-time goal of Musk's — was the real priority.

Is Trump preparing to cancel America's ride back to the moon?
Trump's original nominee for NASA administrator, Jared Isaacman, a close ally of Musk, had traveled to space twice aboard a SpaceX capsule. Isaacman had promised to get the agency working on a crewed mission to Mars. Trump withdrew his nomination shortly after Musk left the government, reportedly further infuriating the tech billionaire.
Without Starship to land on the Moon, there will ""have to be significant changes to the plans there and probably a substantial postponement of the planned timetable for Artemis,"" Farrar says.
But there is a Plan B. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company is developing a moon lander known as Blue Moon.
""NASA could modify the contract and assign Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander to Artemis 3,"" but Blue Origin has a long way to go in development too, Garver says.

Ultimately, neither Trump nor Musk could easily act on their threats to end SpaceX contracts.
""Canceling SpaceX contracts as a personal vendetta wouldn't stand up in the courts,"" Garver
says regarding Trump. Similarly, Musk's suggestion to halt resupply and re-crewing of the space station would be impractical, she adds.

While NASA has yet to select the crew for the Artemis 3 landing, Garver thinks the space agency is unlikely to cancel the mission due to Musk's blustering or Starship's repeated delays.

Dilly Dally, an adolescent loggerhead,
first arrived
at the LMC back in January after being attacked by a predator. Three weeks after her arrival, Dilly Dally went under the knife to remove the damaged appendage.
Despite a few wound complications during her five-month stay at the animal hospital, Dilly Dally now joins fellow rehabilitated loggerheads,
Falafel
— a fellow amputee — and
Scout
, in their return to the wild.
Dilly Dally, like other turtles treated and re-released by the LMC, will be tracked via satellite attached to her shell to chart her movements and monitor her re-acclimation to living in the wild.
Organizations like the LMC prioritize helping heal and protect sea turtles like loggerheads, amid ongoing threats to the endangered creatures' dwindling population — estimated at only about
6.5 million
left in the wild.
Worldwide, the animals and their eggs face the threat of poaching, accidental catching by fishermen and habitat degradation as a result of climate change, pollution and other factors. The
World Wildlife Fund
reports that of the seven species of sea turtles across the world, three are endangered — including two that are listed as critically endangered.
A 2023 study published in the
Zoological Society of London
's journal
Animal Conservation
that sought to track reproduction among female loggerhead amputees wrote that ""limb amputation is a well-known phenomenon in sea turtles,"" and the creatures are able to recover well and relearn to swim after rehabilitation.

The paper concluded that among sea turtles who had suffered amputations, adult females were able to swim ashore in order to nest, but the damaged appendages put them at greater risk from terrestrial threats during the process.
In addition to removal as a medical necessity, accidental amputations can occur among turtles in the wild, often as a result of collisions with boats or the reptiles getting caught in fishing gear.

Archeologists studying a forested area in northern Michigan say they've uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern half of the United States.
The researchers used a drone equipped with a laser instrument to fly over more than 300 acres, taking advantage of a brief period of time after the winter snow had melted away but before the trees had put out their leaves.
Science
The Oldest String Ever Found May Have Been Made By Neanderthals
This allowed the drone to precisely map subtle features on the surface of the exposed ground, revealing parallel rows of earthen mounds. This is what's left of raised gardening beds that were used to grow crops like corn, beans, and squash by the ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, in the centuries before European colonizers arrived.
The mounds appeared to continue on beyond the surveyed area, the researchers say, showing agriculture at a surprisingly vast scale in a place that wasn't a major population center.

""We haven't even been able to locate any significant settlement sites in this region. There's a couple of tiny little villages,"" says
Jesse Casana
, a professor of anthropology at Dartmouth College and one of the authors of a new
report
in
Science
. ""So it's really shocking in this case to see this level of investment in an agricultural system that would require really enormous amounts of human labor to make happen.""
It's especially odd given the relatively poor growing conditions that far north, especially during a period of colder temperatures known as the Little Ice Age, as well as the presence of wild rice right nearby, says
Madeleine McLeester
, a Dartmouth anthropologist who led the research team.
""Why are they investing so many resources into cultivating maize where it's very, very difficult to cultivate maize?"" McLeester wonders. ""It's an interesting puzzle, to be sure.""
Other experts on ancient agricultural systems say the new find is stunning.
""This astonishing paper shows how much we've underestimated the geographic range, productivity, and sustainability of intensive Indigenous agriculture across North America,"" says
Gayle Fritz
, an anthropologist with Washington University in St. Louis.
""The study is outstanding in many ways, one being the long-term collaboration between Menominee tribal members and non-Indigenous archaeologists,"" she says — with the other being the combination of new technologies plus ""old-fashioned, ground-based excavation and survey.""
Sponsor Message
The scale was ""unexpected""
While some people may envision historical Native Americans as mostly hunter-gatherers or nomads, ""that is very incorrect,"" says Casana.
""By the time colonists arrived, what they were encountering were a lot of pretty sedentary communities all over North America who were practicing various forms of farming,"" he says.

Oyster Archaeology: Ancient Trash Holds Clues To Sustainable Harvesting
It's hard to really know how extensive that farming was, however, because evidence usually isn't well-preserved. European settlers generally took over and developed the most fertile land, eventually erasing signs of past indigenous practices with their own plowing and development.
The site mapped in this new study is part of Anaem Omot, which means the ""Dog's Belly"" in Menominee. It's an area along the Menominee River on the border between Michigan and Wisconsin, and is of great cultural and historical significance to the Menominee tribe.
The region contains burial mounds and dance rings. It's also known to have agricultural ridges, ranging from 4 to 12 inches in height, because previous work back in the 1990's had mapped some of them.
""These features are really difficult to see on the ground, even when you're walking around, and they're difficult to map,"" says McLeester.
That difficulty, plus concerns about proposed mining activities in the area, is why the research team — which included the tribe's historic preservation director,
David Grignon
— wanted to see if new technology could reveal more acres covered with the earthen agricultural rows.
McLeester says they thought they'd find some more rows, but also expected that others would have eroded away since the last mapping effort.
""It was really just a test, more than anything else, to see what could we see, what was still there,"" she says.
But the drone surveys revealed that the field system was ten times bigger than what had been previously seen.
""Just the scale, I would say, was unexpected,"" she says, noting that they surveyed less than half of this historic region and the agricultural ridges appear to keep going on beyond the area that they studied in detail. ""They just had a huge field system.""

Tip of the iceberg
This degree of intensive farming in a very northerly location that's not even farmed much today is probably just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" says Casana.
""One of the interesting things about this study is that it kind of shows us a preserved window of what was probably a much more extensive agricultural landscape,"" he says.
John Marston
, an archaeologist with Boston University who wasn't part of the research team, agrees with that assessment. But if this is the tip of the iceberg, he says, ""it may be that the rest of the iceberg has melted.""
The only sites comparable to this discovery can be found in arid regions around Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona, he says, where archaeologists have discovered the traces of large-scale irrigation systems used in ancient Native American agriculture.
""That is the only place in which I'm familiar with landscape features of agriculture that are as well preserved at as large a scale as what we have here in this example,"" he says. ""It's really unusual.""
Susan Kooiman
of Southern Illinois University, an expert on the precontact Indigenous peoples of Eastern North America, says she was ""pretty blown away"" when she learned of this discovery.
""There's not a lot of remnant agricultural fields in eastern North America in general, just because of modern plowing and ground disturbance and development,"" she says. ""And so to find intact, ancient indigenous agricultural fields in any state, at any level, is very rare.""
The size of this particular field system astounded her.
""It requires a lot of labor to create these fields, to clear the forest. This is dense forest, now and then. To clear it, only with stone tools, is a lot of labor, a lot of work,"" she says, noting that the researchers also did excavation work that shows the ancient farmers were deliberately modifying the soils to improve its fertility.
Sponsor Message
""The amount of work, and just how far these fields extend, is beyond anything that I think people suspected was going on this far north in eastern North America,"" she says.
If this same kind of drone technology is used to search other relatively undisturbed areas of forest, Kooiman says, ""we may find more remnants of farm fields than we were expecting originally.""
There are some historic accounts from European settlers and indigenous groups that describe extensive farming, and researchers know that the city of Cahokia, by the Mississippi River, used intensive agriculture to support ten to twenty thousand people.
The ancestral Menominee community that built the agricultural system uncovered by this new research, however, seems to have been less populous and hierarchical than a place like Cahokia, showing that large-scale agriculture may have been a part of life in very different kinds of societies.
""The question now is, what are they doing with all this stuff they were growing?"" says Kooiman. ""Who exactly was consuming all of the stuff that they were producing on these fields?"""

Kyodo News/AP
A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.
The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.
Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft's scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.
CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.
Sponsor Message
Two years ago, the company's first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name ""Resilience"" for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist's toy-size red house for placement on the moon's dusty surface.
Space
Japan's space agency says it may now have clues about the origins of the moon
Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.
""This is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,"" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.
A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. ""Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,"" the company said in a written statement.
Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.
Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.
Sponsor Message
Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon's south pole and was declared dead within hours.
Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side's northern tier.

Plans had called for the 7.5-foot Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.
Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace's European-built rover — named Tenacious — sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.
The rover, weighing just 11 pounds, was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.
Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.
The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.
Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. ""Engineers did everything they possibly could"" to ensure success this time, he said.
He considered the latest moonshot ""merely a steppingstone"" to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.

Ispace, like other businesses, does not have ""infinite funds"" and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace's U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.
While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it's less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.
Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year's end: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic's first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth's atmosphere.

For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.
NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030."

Recent fixes to long-standing problems at the Federal Emergency Management Agency are in jeopardy as the Trump administration slashes programs and cuts staff, emergency experts warn.
FEMA has been plagued for decades by accusations that it fails to help the most vulnerable victims of disasters. Poor people, racial minorities and those who live in rural and tribal areas have been chronically ignored or denied crucial help after disasters, with long-term and even deadly consequences for families,
NPR investigations have found
.
Under the Biden administration, FEMA took
some concrete steps
to address those problems. For example, the agency simplified forms that disaster victims must fill out to apply for money, loosened requirements to prove residency and made some money for essential items like food and diapers available immediately.
Sponsor Message
Now, some of those efforts have been canceled, while others face an uncertain future. President Trump has repeatedly said that he believed FEMA should not exist in its current form. He has also moved to eliminate so-called equity programs meant to ensure that the federal government serves Americans from all economic, geographic and ethnic groups.
The agency has cut billions of dollars of programs and lost hundreds of staff. A recent White House budget request for FEMA included a significant increase in disaster relief funding, but a presidentially appointed FEMA review council is working on recommendations to pare down or eliminate the agency.
FEMA did not respond to questions from NPR about how it intends to help all Americans adequately after disasters, or whether reforms made under the Biden administration will be rolled back.
""There was a lot of headway being made,"" says Chauncia Willis-Johnson, the former emergency manager for Tampa, Fla., and the leader of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management. ""Now, not only have we stopped, but we've actually regressed.""
Baby steps for a plagued agency
Under the Biden administration, the goal at FEMA was to make sure every disaster victim got what they needed to recover and be protected against the next disaster, says then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. ""No two communities are alike, they all have different needs, and we can't apply a one-size-fits-all application of programs,"" she explains. ""And so that was the focus: equity.""
Sponsor Message
For example, imagine two different people, both struggling after a hurricane: The first is a parent who rented a now-damaged apartment in a city. The second is an elderly person who owns a damaged house in a rural area. One might need immediate cash to get food and diapers and pay for a hotel. The other might need in-person help filling out forms online or transportation to pick up crucial medication.
FEMA also brought in a high-level advocate for rural communities, and another one for tribal communities, to help the agency serve those populations better. And FEMA made it easier for people to prove where they lived, especially if they were living in a family home that had been passed down over many generations and no longer had a mortgage or a clear deed tied to the current occupants.
People who are staying with family members without a lease agreement, or who have inherited property informally, have
long struggled to get federal help
rebuilding after extreme weather, despite the fact that such families are less likely to have home insurance.
While the long-standing problems at FEMA were far from fixed at the end of the Biden administration, such equity policies were a step in the right direction, according to disaster experts.
""Was FEMA necessarily doing a good job? They weren't perfect,"" says Willis-Johnson. But ""there were a lot of positive movements made within the last five years.""
Donnie Speight's home in DeQuincy, La., was badly damaged by a hurricane in 2020. She struggled to get adequate assistance from FEMA, and spoke to NPR for an investigation that found the agency chronically ignored and failed to help those who needed it the most. Biden-era reforms meant to correct that pattern are now in jeopardy.

Serving those most in need
One of President Trump's first actions when he took office in January was to sign an executive order banning so-called diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government. That order led to the cancellation of at least one major disaster staffing program, known as FEMA Corps, which trained and deployed young people to help after disasters.
Earlier this spring, FEMA
also canceled
a major disaster preparedness grant program that had awarded tens of billions of dollars to help underserved rural communities prepare for floods, wildfires and other extreme events that are getting more common as the climate changes.
Sponsor Message
The program had also helped some small towns and tribal communities by providing technical aid in applying for highly sought after federal funds. ""We wanted them to have a fair shot at the funding that was out there,"" Criswell explains. Now,
that assistance is gone
.
Some equity efforts put into place at FEMA appear to still be intact. Last year, the agency made it easier for individuals and families to apply for money after disasters, by combining redundant forms and paying disaster survivors up to $750 to cover immediate needs such as food, water, medication and diapers. That assistance was expected to be
particularly helpful
for survivors who do not have a lot of money saved and who don't have homeowner's or renter's insurance.
Such efforts are a step in the right direction, says Manann Donoghoe, who studies disaster recovery at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research organization in Washington, D.C. ""Some individuals are more vulnerable than others, and we need a system that understands and reacts to that,"" he explains.
The importance of boots on the ground
Between the cancellation of FEMA Corps,
firing
of probationary employees and a raft of retirements and resignations
across the agency
, FEMA is grappling with a large number of staff vacancies going into the summer months, when hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other extreme weather get more common in the U.S.
That may mean fewer federally trained disaster responders on the ground than in past years and potentially less equitable aid distribution.
The profound importance of boots on the ground was made clear in 2020. After wildfires in Oregon destroyed thousands of homes, many of them in low-income rural parts of the state, FEMA denied about 70% of assistance applications, an
NPR investigation
found.
""I was talking to our team on the ground,"" remembers Criswell, who took over as FEMA's leader shortly after the wildfires. ""They were telling me how there [were] a large number of people that were denied assistance. But they could see there was enormous need.""
Sponsor Message
Criswell says FEMA workers called back everybody whose application had been denied and found that many people were actually eligible for money but had filled out forms incorrectly or incompletely. FEMA workers on the ground in Oregon ""were actually able to get a good percentage of them assistance just by taking the time to go over them with it,"" Criswell says.
It was an example of how important on-the-ground federal workers can be for victims of disasters, especially those who may not be proficient with a computer or able to fill out complex forms without help, says Criswell.
Willis-Johnson says expanding in-person assistance and knocking on doors after disasters was a crucial step in the right direction for an agency that has long failed to serve Black disaster survivors and other marginalized groups. ""FEMA was going into the underserved neighborhoods to make people aware of their options, and making them aware of the need to fill out post-disaster recovery assistance forms,"" Willis-Johnson says.
Now, she is worried that vulnerable people will struggle to get basic help after disasters. ""Why would we ever want people to suffer?"" she says. ""You shouldn't want that. It's not OK."""

After taking time to heal, Gerardi and her family decided to try again. And she was
just as committed to sharing every step of the IVF process this time around — especially her joy and hope.
""Nothing is ever guaranteed in IVF,"" Gerardi said. ""I'm not unaware that it is a distinct possibility that either the same thing happens again, which would be equally devastating, or you know transfers don't work … whatever it may be. I know the risks, and I know that nothing is a given. And yet, I'm still allowing myself [to] exist in this level of hope and enthusiasm and optimism.""
Gerardi has a second space mission scheduled for 2026. While she's still figuring out the best timeline for herself and her family, those three embryos are set to be frozen and she has high hopes for a transfer in the future.

Get cut off in rush-hour traffic and you may feel angry for the whole trip, or even snap at a noisy child in the back seat.
Get an unexpected smile from that same kid and you may feel like rush hour — and even those other drivers — aren't so bad.
""The thing about emotion is it generalizes. It puts the brain into a broader state,"" says
Dr. Karl Deisseroth
, a psychiatrist and professor at Stanford University.

Can this nasal spray slow down Alzheimer's? One couple is helping scientists find out
Deisseroth and a team of researchers have come up with an explanation for how that happens.
The process involves a signal that, after a positive or negative experience, lingers in the brain, the team
reports
in the journal
Science.
Experiences themselves act a bit like piano notes in the brain. Some are staccato, producing only a brief burst of activity that may result in a reflexive response, like honking at another driver, or smiling back at a child.
Science
Chimps' rhythmic drumming and complex calls hint at origins of human language
But more profound experiences can be more like a musical note that is held with the sustain pedal and still audible when the next note is played, or the one after that.
""You just need it to be sustained long enough to merge with and interact with other notes,"" Deisseroth says. ""And from our perspective, this is exactly what emotion needs.""
If the team is right, it could help explain the emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions.
People on the autism spectrum, for example, often have trouble recognizing emotions in others, and regulating their own emotions. Schizophrenia can cause mood swings and reduced emotional expression.
But some researchers question whether this lingering signal is specific to emotion, a term with no agreed-upon definition in the scientific world.
Treatments
Did a new Alzheimer's drug keep this patient's brain healthier for longer?
""Sure, [a sustained signal] happens in emotion,"" says
Lisa Feldman Barrett
, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. ""But it also happens in all kinds of other instances,"" like when a person is concentrating or remembering.
Emoting in the lab
Deisseroth and his team set out to recreate the sort of experience that leads to an emotional response, but could be observed in a lab.
""We wanted something that would cause a negative emotion but wouldn't be painful,"" he says.
Sponsor Message
They chose a puff of air, delivered to the cornea. That meant they could use a machine that eye doctors use to detect glaucoma.
The puff from this device is ""certainly annoying, certainly aversive, but not painful,"" Deisseroth says.
The team also thought it might provoke the same response in mice, an animal that predates humans by millions of years.
It turned out that both mice and people blink reflexively in response to a puff. Both species also respond to multiple puffs by squinting to protect their eyes.
Next, the team studied the brain activity associated with these experiences. And they found two distinct phases involving different brain circuits.
The first phase is like a staccato note on a piano. In the first two-tenths of a second after a puff, there's a spike in the activity of brain circuits that process sensory input.
The second phase is more like a piano note held by the sustain pedal. During this period, activity appears in other circuits, including those involved in emotion.
When mice and people were exposed to puffs of air again and again — and again — this sustained response got stronger with each stimulus.
Behavior changed too. Both mice and people squinted more, and the people reported that they were more annoyed by the experience.
""In the mice, although we don't get those verbal reports, we saw this crucial generalization,"" Deisseroth says. ""It made them less likely to seek out rewards.""
That behavior, a failure to look for food and other rewards, is a sign of stress or some other negative state in mice.
Enter Ketamine
To confirm the finding, the team did the experiment again. But this time, both mice and people received an anesthetic called ketamine. They thought the drug might disconnect a negative sensory experience from any emotional response it would ordinarily produce.
Sponsor Message
On ketamine, the second, sustained phase of brain activity was no longer present, and responses to the air puffs changed.
Mice and people would still blink reflexively after a puff of air. But they didn't squint. And people reported that they no longer found the puffs of air annoying.
""If you remove this sustain phase, you block the emotional response as well,"" Deisseroth says.
Sort of, Barrett says.
The study shows that persistent signals in the brain play a role in altering a person or animal's brain state, she says. But that brain state could be consciousness or focus, rather than an emotion.
Ketamine, she says, interferes with all of these states.
""That tells us that the way that the brain creates emotion is how it creates everything else — how it creates thoughts, how it creates perceptions, how it creates actions,"" Barrett says. ""It's not doing something special in emotion.""
Barrett also thinks the air puffs probably mean something different to a mouse than to a person.
""The human brain has this capacity to abstract, to create meanings that go beyond motor and sensory differences,"" she says.
Barrett's concerns about how emotions are studied extends to
lots of other research
.
The underlying problem, she says, is that scientists have yet to agree on a common definition of an emotion."

Humans have been fascinated by the anglerfish for a long time (check out this engraving from 1893). But how did this deep sea predator first evolve? New research sheds light on the bathypelagic fish's evolutionary history.
Getty Images
Most undergrads don't get the chance to work with museum-preserved specimens of deep sea anglerfish. Then again, Rose Faucher isn't most undergrads.
""The fish world is actually pretty small, and it feels kind of like everybody knows everybody,"" says Faucher, who graduated from Rice University recently with her bachelor's degree in cell biology and genetics.
""They'll FedEx you a fish that has been sitting in a jar since like 1965 ... and you get to open up a package in lab one day, and you're holding one of the rarest fish on earth.""
One particular unboxing of a footballfish — a bulbous, prickly-skinned fish with needle-sharp teeth and a stalk-like lure on its head — was especially memorable. ""I was so excited, I [picked it up] and ran down the halls of this building to go and show all of my friends that I had a football fish,"" she says.
Sponsor Message
Her friends, she says, were considerably less excited about the find. ""I'm sure it's shocking to hear, but 60 year old fish sitting in ethanol do have a particular smell about them.""
Faucher handled these fish as part of a larger research project on the evolution of bathypelagic anglerfish, led by ichthyologist
Elizabeth Miller
. Miller, whose project was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, built a family tree using genetic information from hundreds of samples and anglerfish specimens across the globe.
""The most surprising [part of this study] was the overall story that the bathypelagic anglerfish seem to have arisen from a deep sea benthic ancestor,"" Miller says. ""And it was this transition off the sea floor ...  that seems to have spurred all of this morphological diversity.""
There are over 200 species of deep-sea anglerfish; some are long and thin, like eels, some are squat and round, some have fins that they use to ""walk"" along the sea floor, and others have huge eyes set far back into their heads. The family tree that Miller and Faucher built indicates that this variety in shape and size exploded after the anglerfish left the sea floor, and that new ecological opportunities may have spurred them to do so.
Sponsor Message
""What we're learning from ... the evolutionary history of the anglerfish, is that [the deep sea] also might be a place where you can evolve a lot of biodiversity,"" says Miller. ""And that's a totally new way of looking at that environment.""

As artificial intelligence seeps into various areas of our society, it's rushing into others. One area it's making a big difference is protein science. We're talking the molecules that make our cells work. AI has hurtled the field forward by predicting what these molecular machines look like, which tells scientists how they do what they do — from processing our food to turning light into sugar.
Now, scientists at Google DeepMind have taken their protein prediction model to the next level with the release of AlphaFold3. It's an AI program that can predict the unique shape of proteins, as well as almost any other type of molecule a protein attaches to in order to function.

Singing to babies comes naturally for many parents.
And now, a new study from Yale University finds that singing to babies lifts their moods and improves their overall well-being.
""Infants who are being sung to a lot are happier in general throughout the day, not just when singing is happening,"" said Samuel Mehr, an associate professor adjunct at the Yale University Child Study Center and one of the authors of the study.
He and his team looked at 110 parents and their babies, most of them under fourth months old.
""We send very, very quick surveys to parents by text message, and we do that at random intervals each day. And the surveys are really, really quick and easy to answer accurately,"" said Mehr. ""There are things like in the last two or 3 hours, did your baby cry? You know, in the last 2 to 3 hours, how happy was your baby?""

The parents were divided into two groups. One was asked to sing more to their babies, with some extra support and resources, while the other continued their daily routines as usual.
Mehr says that you don't have to limit the songs you sing to classic lullabies like ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.""
""If you want to sing, you know, Led Zeppelin, that's also fine,"" said Mehr. ""Anything that gives your baby a chance to hear your voice, I think, is all good.""

There are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.
Every few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.
""Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes"", says
James Henriksen
, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.
Henriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. ""Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,"" he says, ""I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.""
Sponsor Message
This uncanny ability of microbes ""to
survive and thrive
in these unusual places,"" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.
One of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is ""taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.""
So they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.
Researchers suspect this thick, rusty mat that's accumulated beneath an outflow pipe near Iron Spring is bursting with microorganisms.

Microbial alchemy
""Microbes are nature's alchemists,"" says
Braden Tierney
, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.
""They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,"" he says. ""Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.""
This allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.
Sponsor Message
Several years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run across
a study
from a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, ""just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,"" he says.
And Tierney thought, ""Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2."" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.
""We ended up almost immediately
finding a microorganism
that was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,"" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.
""To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,"" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.
This discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.
So he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit called
The Two Frontiers Project
to search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.
Their mission is straightforward. ""We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,"" says Tierney.
The hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. ""Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,"" says Henriksen.
Sponsor Message
In fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with ""a wide range of physiologies"" that are similarly ""unique and useful"" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.
The group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!
At Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.

One person's sludge is another person's startup
""You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,"" says
Chris Beuret
, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.
Beuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractor
Brian Orr
has filled entire buckets with ""this gelatinous glop."" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to ""elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.""
Henriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across a
paper
that ""had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.""
He concluded that ""the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.""
And they may also be
extreme
environments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.

Emma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: ""It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.""
As with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.
Krista Ryon

From microbial discovery to deployment
There's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.
""Microbes are amazing at what they do,"" says
Lisa Stein
, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. ""But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?""
For instance, ""once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,"" says
Holly Jean Buck
, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, ""the carbon has to go somewhere,"" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.
Sponsor Message
The approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is ""a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.""
But Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. ""Kudos to them for having that idea,"" she says. ""That's pretty innovative right there."" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. ""I'm glad they're looking into it,"" she says. ""I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.""
Still, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.
Back at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. ""We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,"" he says, ""not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.""
He enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.
""I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,"" says Henriksen. ""You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover."""

Animals are changing their behaviors and bodies in response to man-made climate change.
In recent years, some birds have exhibited larger beaks

Animals that migrate when the seasons change have been observed
to seek higher latitudes
.
Now, scientists have found that the clownfish, the saltwater fish featured in the hit Disney film

Melissa Versteeg, a Ph.D. student in marine science at Newcastle University and co-author of a paper recently published in the journal

""It's usually assumed that growth is relatively one way, so it's favorable to be a bit bigger. And we've not really seen before that they actually have this capacity or ability to shrink,"" Versteeg said.
Versteeg's team measured 134 clownfish along reefs in Papua New Guinea every month for five months and monitored water temperatures during a marine heatwave.
They found that some clownfish, which are only 3 inches long on average, shrank as the water's temperature increased – and that those that did shrink
increased their chances of surviving
the heat stress by as much as 78%.
""When they shrink, it's about one or 2% of their body size,"" Versteeg said. ""And so really small length reductions of just like between one and two millimeters.""
Science
Humans still haven't seen 99.999% of the deep seafloor
Why the fish might be shrinking
Versteeg said it's not yet clear how the fish are shrinking or why they were significantly more likely to survive the heat wave. But the research team speculates that the fishes literally being smaller – by shrinking their body size – means needing less food, making their metabolism more efficient.
""Something about these shrinking fish was giving them a better opportunity to survive the heat wave compared to the ones that kept growing bigger in size,"" Versteeg said, adding that the fish grew again when water conditions improved.

Sailors have reported mysterious ""milky seas,"" or miles-long glowing patches of ocean for centuries. Some researchers have created a database to figure out why they glow.
Steven D. Miller/CIRA/CSU and NOAA/NESDIS
For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during a moonless night.
In 1849, on the Arabian Sea, Captain Kempthorne, described a ""most extraordinary phenomenon of the most dazzling brightness, and of highly phosphorescent nature. In fact it looked as if we were sailing over a boundless plain of snow, or a sea of quicksilver.""
Today, this phenomenon is known as ""milky seas."" But little is known about the phenomenon. The only scientific sample was collected in 1985.
So atmospheric scientist
Justin Hudson
, a PhD candidate at
Colorado State University
used accounts like Kempthorne's spanning 400 years to create a database of these milky seas reports. This database also includes satellite images that can confirm large swaths of milky seas.
Sponsor Message
Hudson hopes the database can give researchers a better idea on where and when milky seas occur, so research vessels can take samples of the glowing water.
Hudson's PhD advisor and fellow atmospheric scientist, Steven D. Miller, says sampling is difficult because milky seas tend to be in remote places.
""About 70% of the world is covered in ocean, and there's just very few people out in any one given spot,"" Miller says.
The one scientific sample pointed towards the bacteria
Vibrio harveyi
as the cause of the eerie bioluminescence. However, Hudson says this kind of glowing is different from what people may have previously encountered in the wild.
""The more typical bioluminescence you see out on the ocean is caused by this organism called dinoflagellates,"" he says. ""It glows in response to some kind of shock. Something nudges it or it gets inside a crashing wave.""
Vibrio harveyi
produces a constant glow when it reaches a population maximum. Scientists think this phenomenon is supposed to attract predators that will eat them and give them another environment to thrive in: the predators' stomachs.

Joe Walsh, 79, is waiting to inhale.
He's perched on a tan recliner at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. His wife, Karen Walsh, hovers over him, ready to depress the plunger on a nasal spray applicator.
""One, two, three,"" a nurse counts. The plunger plunges, Walsh sniffs, and it's done.
The nasal spray contains an experimental monoclonal antibody meant to reduce the Alzheimer's-related inflammation in Walsh's brain.
He is the first person living with Alzheimer's to get the treatment, which is also being tested in people with diseases including multiple sclerosis, ALS and COVID-19.

""I think this is something special,"" says Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham who helped develop the nasal spray, along with its maker, Tiziana Life Sciences.
Whether a decrease in inflammation will bring improvements in Walsh's thinking and memory, however, remains unclear.

The experimental treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia.
Two drugs now on the market clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic protein that accumulate between neurons. Other experimental drugs have targeted the tau tangles, a different protein that builds up inside nerve cells.
But fewer efforts have tried to address inflammation, a sign of Alzheimer's that becomes more pronounced as the disease progresses.

""As much as I was in shock,"" Karen Walsh says, ""the words were ringing in my head: 'ask for the research.'""
So she began looking for a clinical trial. But in 2020, COVID arrived in the U.S., shuttering hundreds of research studies. By the time the pandemic subsided, Walsh's Alzheimer's had progressed to the point where he no longer qualified for most studies.
A novel drug for inflammation
In late 2024, Karen brought Joe to Dr. Seth Gale, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School who promised to look for a research study Walsh could enter.

Before long, Gale received a query from a colleague looking for a patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease to take part in a trial. He called the Walshes.
The research involved a monoclonal antibody called foralumab that was being tested on people with inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.

MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering around nerve fibers, causing inflammation. And foralumab was producing promising results in MS patients.
""It induces regulatory cells that go to the brain and shut down inflammation,"" Weiner says.
Those regulatory cells reduce the activity of microglia, the cells that serve as the primary immune system in the brain and spinal cord.
Weiner thought foralumab might help with another condition that causes damaging inflammation in the nervous system.
""I've always been interested in Alzheimer's disease,"" Weiner says. ""I lost my mother to Alzheimer's disease.""
Most efforts to treat Alzheimer's involve clearing the brain of the disease's hallmarks: sticky amyloid plaques and tangled fibers called tau. But increasingly, researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies those brain changes, especially as the disease progresses.
""Once people have Alzheimer's, the inflammation is driving the disease more,"" Weiner says.
Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.

The approach worked in mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's.
But in order to treat Walsh, Weiner's team had to get special permission from the Food and Drug Administration through a program called expanded access. The program is for patients who can't get into a clinical trial and have no other treatment options.
When the FDA approved foralumab for Walsh, he became the first Alzheimer's patient to get the treatment.
Six months later, the drug has dramatically reduced the inflammation in Walsh's brain. But no drug can restore brain cells that have already been lost.
It will take a battery of cognitive tests to see if Walsh's memory and thinking have improved with the treatment. Karen Walsh, though, sees some positive signs.

A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.
The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.
Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the
hottest day in Seattle's history
. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit,
according to the lawsuit
filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.
Sponsor Message
The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.
""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""
In
a rapid attribution study
released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""
A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""
Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.
Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already
face dozens of other climate lawsuits
filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.
Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge
recently dismissed
a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.
Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""
Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court
rejected an effort by oil and gas companies
to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices
turned down a request
by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the
Justice Department sued
Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.
Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.
""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person."""

Bundled in a little blanket on a plush couch, Valerie doesn't quite look like a dog who recently survived more than 17 months in the Australian wilderness. She's nestled between her two owners, 24-year-old Georgia Gardner and 25-year-old Josh Fishlock, licking the couple's faces every so often as they talk over Zoom.
""She's the queen of the house,"" Gardner says, smiling. ""It's her house and we just live in it a bit.""
But for 529 days, Valerie — a roughly 10-pound mini dachshund with short legs and a long black and brown body — was missing from that house. During a November 2023 camping trip to Kangaroo Island, a remote island in southern Australia, she ran away from the campsite.

Valerie was microchipped and also had an Apple AirTag on her collar. But the island is sparsely populated, largely used for farming and livestock, and the tag needed Apple Bluetooth devices nearby to track her down.
So the couple did what others do when their pets go missing: They posted about her disappearance on a local Facebook group, left some of their clothes and toys with Valerie's scent near the spot she ran off, and switched the AirTag into ""lost"" mode. But despite searching for days with members of the community, Gardner and Fishlock had to return home to mainland Australia, leaving the island without her.
""Leaving the island was probably the hardest decision I think I've ever made in my life. We went over there as three, and we were going back as two. It was a very horrible feeling,"" Fishlock remembers.

They tried to hold out hope that someone would find her, and they'd be back in a week or two to pick her up.
But weeks turned into months, and there still was no word about Valerie. Gardner says the couple tried to cope with the fact that their tiny dog had disappeared on an island home to predators like snakes and eagles. They made up a story, trying to convince themselves that she'd been picked up by an old lady on a farm, and was now eating dog biscuits and sleeping in a warm bed.

Six months after getting lost, an orange cat found its way back to the right person
""But we definitely had to be realistic that we might never get her home. And we had to move through that grief,"" she says.
Then, one day this past February, more than a year after Valerie had gone missing, a farmer on Kangaroo Island snapped a photo of a tiny dog running through fields. That photo eventually made it to the
Kangala Wildlife Rescue
— a local animal rescue on the island generally focused more on wildlife than pets — who had been in contact with Valerie's owners since she'd gone missing and shared it with them.

Gardner says at first they couldn't believe it.
""There's no way a four-kilo dog could survive that long,"" she remembers thinking. But, she says, the photo was absolutely Valerie.
Lisa Karran, who runs Kangala Wildlife Rescue with her husband Jared, says once that photo came through, they got to work trying to rescue Valerie during their off-hours.
It was no small feat.
Karran says they first thought it would take only a few days to catch the mini dachshund. They put out about a dozen of what she calls ""cat traps"" — basic cages with a plate of food and a door that latches when an animal goes in. But they kept catching nearly everything — brush tail possums, feral cats, wallabies — except Valerie.
""Even a few kangaroos put their heads in there,"" she remembers.
So, along with a team of other volunteers, they began experimenting with different traps, often working long nights with little to no sleep. Eventually they rigged up a big pen with a roof, several wildlife cameras and a remote-controlled door, setting it in the spot where Valerie had been seen last. They replenished it daily with food like roast chicken, and filled it with Valerie's toys and clothes that carried the scent of her owners.

Eventually, Valerie started showing up, grabbing food before darting back out again. And, finally, after nearly two months of trying to capture the little dog, everything lined up. Valerie entered the pen and relaxed a bit. Then, they hit the remote to drop the door.
""It was surreal walking down to the trap site from the car, and you could hear her barking,"" Karran remembers. She climbed into the pen alongside her daughter, and eventually Valerie climbed into their laps and fell asleep.
""Our hearts just broke then. We knew she never, ever wanted to be a minute out there,"" she says.

No one quite knows how exactly Valerie survived so many days in the wild. She was ultimately found about 30 miles from the campsite she'd left. Karran speculates that she was drinking water from nearby farms, burrowing in the dirt for shelter or even eating the carcasses of dead animals.
After her capture, Valerie went to the vet and got a clean bill of health. She'd even gained some weight. ""She's got the physique of a little bodybuilder,"" Karran laughed.
About a month has passed since her big adventure came to an end, and Valerie has been back home with Gardner and Fishlock for about two weeks. They say she's settled right back in: playing with her toys, cuddling in bed and going on walks just like before she went missing.

Karran says people have asked her why she and her team put so much effort and time into finding one tiny dog. But for her, it was simple.
""If it was your dog, what would you want someone to do? Wouldn't you want someone to say, hey let's do the best we can? We should all as humans just come together and make it right, or at least try,"" she says.
Gardner and Fishlock say they've been flooded with messages about Valerie, many from people saying her story gave them hope. Gardner says she hopes that's what people can take away from the saga.
""If a tiny, little four-kilo sausage dog can survive on Kangaroo Island in the Australian bush, then you know, you too can survive whatever it is you're going through,"" she says."

Depending on what time it is, your body responds differently to an injury or infection. During the day, you're likely to heal faster and fight infection better than at night.
Historically, scientists weren't entirely sure why.
That picture is starting to clear up thanks to a new study published last week in the journal

Drew Angerer/Getty Images
The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.
At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.
Sponsor Message
In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.
Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""
Sponsor Message
Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's  ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""
Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""
At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.
What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""
But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""
Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.
""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country."""

LIMA, Peru — A Peruvian farmer and mountain guide has lost a landmark climate change lawsuit against one of Europe's largest power companies.
Saúl Luciano Lliuya
, who lives in a city in the central Ancash region, in the heart of the Andes, sued RWE, one of Europe's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, over the risk of flooding to his home from a glacial lake swollen by climate change. Although RWE has never operated in Peru, Luciano Lliuya argued the company's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers threatening his city.
But a court in Hamm, in northwestern Germany, ruled that the probability of the lake bursting its banks and devastating his home and the homes of some 50,000 other people in the area was too small for RWE to be held liable. It also barred him from appealing the verdict.
Sponsor Message
The ruling brings to an end a decade-long lawsuit in which Luciano Lliuya, supported by environmental group Germanwatch, had sought roughly $18,000 from RWE to pay for 0.5% of the cost of building a dyke to protect his home and the homes of his neighbors - the percentage equal to the proportion of RWA's total historic carbon emissions according to Germanwatch.
The company is now moving quickly into renewable energy and vows to become carbon neutral by 2040. But its power plants have been running on coal for
more than a century
.
Germanwatch warned that Lake Palcacocha had swollen to more than 30 times its historic volume and could overflow catastrophically in the event of an avalanche.
Ultimately, the court ruled that the probability of that happening was just over 1% in the next 30 years, below the threshold under German law for RWE to be found liable.
The German energy giant had argued that the issue of climate change should be resolved by governments and not in a court. In a statement after the verdict on Wednesday, RWE said a win against them would have had ""unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location, because ultimately claims could be asserted against any German company anywhere in the world for damage caused by climate change.""
Sponsor Message
This is just one of a
wave of climate litigation
cases against big industry and governments in recent years. Germanwatch is still claiming a win. It says that the court ruled on the specific risk of Lake Palcacocha bursting its banks. But, by allowing the case to proceed through the German court system for a decade, had accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs from around the world can use German property laws to sue German companies over their carbon emissions.
Petra Minnerop, an expert in international climate law at the United Kingdom's Durham University, who was not involved in the case, broadly backed Germanwatch's interpretation. ""It was only a factual question, not a legal one,"" she told NPR, meaning that the door remained open for similar litigation in Germany."

I get why nearly two centuries ago, Charles Darwin was fascinated by these seabirds and gave them top billing in his theory of evolution. I couldn't get enough — equally amused at their gangly gait on land (their name comes from the Spanish

Is polygenic genetic testing ethical?
Getty Images
A newly available kind of genetic testing, called polygenic embryo screening, promises to screen for conditions that can include cancer, obesity, autism, bipolar disorder, even celiac disease. These conditions are informed by many genetic variants and environmental factors - so companies like Orchid and Heliospect assign risk scores to each embryo for a given condition. These tests are expensive, only available through IVF, and some researchers question how these risk scores are calculated. But what would it mean culturally if more people tried to screen out some of these conditions? And how does this connect to societal ideas about whose lives are meaningful?

Elon Musk's giant, multi-billion-dollar mega rocket launched again from Texas on Tuesday evening for another test flight. This time, however, the rocket lost lost control due to a leak, making a controlled landing unlikely, SpaceX announcers said during the flight's livestream.
The rocket, known as Starship, had experienced a similar issue during its third test flight.
Tuesday's voyage comes after
two spectacular
failures earlier this year that saw the test vehicles explode high above the Caribbean, scattering debris and forcing aircraft in the region
to scramble
.
Starship is the largest rocket
ever built. On this flight, its lower stage, known as ""Super Heavy,"" used 33 powerful engines to lift Starship to the edge of space. Starship then separated from Super Heavy and ignited its six engines. It flew around earth for less than an hour, while conducting numerous tests. Although several dummy satellites were scheduled for launch, a door on the ship did not open as intended.

SpaceX says it would be conducting the landing over water because it wants to test whether the booster can successfully land without one of its three center engines igniting. The engine will be deliberately disabled to see if the booster can compensate using other engines on board.
Starship has completed a similar journey three times before, but it never made it past North America on its last two test flights. Minutes after both launches, it exploded, showering the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos with debris and forcing airliners to divert from their flight paths.
The Starship launchpad is located in Boca Chica, Texas, near a state park and federal wildlife refuge,
which has drawn scrutiny from environmentalists.
Environmentalists have scrutinized the Starship launches.
Records from the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality show SpaceX has violated the Clean Water Act by spewing tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater into the Texas environment.  Last September, the agencies collectively fined Musk about $150,000 last September for the infractions. Additionally,
a report
by the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program concluded that SpaceX launches have destroyed the nests of vulnerable shorebirds.

But the company has trekked on
.
SpaceX says it now believes the failures were caused by two separate problems with Starship. The first, in January, was caused by ""a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,"" according to the company. The second failure in March was caused by a hardware failure above one of the spacecraft's six engines, which resulted in an onboard fire.

""While the failure manifested at a similar point in the flight timeline as Starship's seventh flight test, it is worth noting that the failures are distinctly different,"" the company said

Matthew Morriss
Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, likely got rapidly carved 2.1 million years ago when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to start overflowing.
That's according to a new
study
that looked at ancient river sediments that have long been hidden away inside the canyon's caves, which now lie high above today's Snake River.
This new work is ""brilliant because they realized that this really enigmatic canyon that people have wondered about for over a century could be dated using caves,"" says
Darryl Granger
, a geoscientist at Purdue University who wasn't part of the research team.
Sponsor Message
""They had the persistence to find the right caves that still had river sand and gravel inside, just as it was deposited millions of years ago,"" he says.
Hells Canyon, which is on the border between Oregon and Idaho, is almost 8,000 feet deep. That makes it far deeper than the famous Grand Canyon of Arizona, which reaches a depth of about 6,000 feet and which has been well studied by geologists who want to know how and
when
it formed.
""The Hells Canyon, despite being a deeper canyon, has not really attracted as much modern scientific interest,"" says
Matthew Morriss
, a geologist with the Utah Geological Survey.
He personally became interested back when he was 19 years old, and visited the canyon during a college field trip. It made him wonder how and when the canyon got created.
""As an Earth scientist and as just a citizen of this country, we have these big landscapes. And for people who visit them, it's an important part of the natural history, to understand what formed the landscapes that inspire at such a scale,"" he says.
He made multiple trips to the canyon, hiking up steep slopes and fighting poison ivy, trying to find places where the river might have left behind gravelly sediments back when it created the canyon by wearing through rock.
Sponsor Message
""You're looking for pieces of evidence of where the river used to be,"" says Morriss.
Sometimes, as a river carves down through rock to make a canyon, it can leave behind small rock shelves on the canyon's walls. These flat terraces can end up covered with river sediments, and scientists have ways of figuring out how long the layers of sediment have been sitting there.
But in Hells Canyon, the rock walls close to the river were so steep, they didn't have these shelves. So Morriss went looking for old river sediments someplace else: inside of caves.
Limestone caves that faced the river might have temporarily been filled with sediment-carrying water as the river carved the canyon, he figured.
Science
Why the most climate-resistant glaciers are hiding in plain sight
Other river canyons have been dated this way in the past, says Granger, who first used this approach in the 1990's.
""But it requires pretty special circumstances for it to work,"" says Granger. ""You have to have the right river, carrying the right minerals, and there have to be caves.""
Morriss teamed up with local spelunkers, who knew the area, to search for caves in Hells Canyon that might fit the bill.
Sarah Wolfe, a member of the cave exploration team, helps collect sediments from one of the caves in Hells Canyon.

Matthew Morriss
""Lo and behold, the first cave we went in together, we did find a lot of gravel we were able to sample,"" he says, noting that this cave is about 1,200 feet above the modern-day Snake River.
Eventually, by exploring over 30 caves, they found old river sediments in a couple other caves, too.
Then the research team used a dating technique on the sediment samples to reveal how long it had been since the river stashed these minerals underground in these caves. There, the minerals were protected from incoming cosmic rays that would have otherwise changed their chemical makeup over time.
The results, published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, indicate that ""the river is carving a new course that is 2.1 million years old,"" says Morriss. ""There was no river canyon there before 2.1 million years ago.""
Sponsor Message
The researchers believe that the canyon emerged when a huge lake in what's now Idaho drained away and
disappeared
from the landscape.
Geologic changes and melting glaciers around this lake would have resulted in a lot more water heading into it, explains Morriss, leading to a ""fill and spill"" episode that seems to have supplied the water needed to carve out Hells Canyon.
He was surprised by the age of the canyon.
""This is younger than the youngest reported age for the Grand Canyon,"" he says, noting that the Grand Canyon's youngest stretches are about 5 million years old. ""Hells Canyon's incision is much more recent.""
And he was glad to finally be able to answer the question he wondered about as a teenager on that field trip to Hells Canyon.
""It was nice to put that to rest and also be able to email my college professors and say, 'See, I told you I'd find out how old this was' and be able to share that excitement with them,"" says Morriss. ""It was really fun."""

VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. — A British-South African endurance athlete became the first person to swim around the island of Martha's Vineyard on Monday, completing a 60-mile (97-kilometer) trek over multiple days to raise awareness about the plight of sharks as the film ""Jaws"" nears its 50th birthday.

Regeneration, super strength, stolen powers: Meet sea creatures inspiring research
Lewis Pugh, 55, began swimming multiple hours a day in the 47-degree (8 degrees Celsius) water on May 15. He wants to change public perceptions and encourage protections for the at-risk animals — which he said the film maligned as ""villains, as cold-blooded killers.""
""We've been fighting sharks for 50 years,"" he said after completing the last 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) of the swim before exiting the ocean at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, near where ""Jaws"" was filmed. ""Now, we need to make peace with them.""
In total, Pugh swam for about 24 hours over 12 days. His first stop in Edgartown after greeting cheering fans on the beach was at an ice cream shop, where he enjoyed a cone of salted caramel and berry brownie.

Rough waters made a cold swim harder
Pugh said this was among his most difficult endurance swims in an almost 40-year career, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. Pugh was the first athlete to swim across the North Pole and complete a long-distance swim in every one of the world's oceans.
Sponsor Message
He said he expected the swim to be difficult because of the water temperature, the distance and the fact that it was happening during the start of shark migration season. But the weather proved the most challenging element of all.
""It's been a long journey, it really has — 12 days, cold water, constant wind, waves, and then always thinking of what may be beneath me. It's been a big swim. A very big swim,"" he said. ""When you swim for 12 days, you leave as one person and I think you come back as a different person with a new reflection on what you've been through.""
Day after day, Pugh entered the island's frigid waters wearing just trunks, a cap and goggles, enduring foul weather as a nor'easter dumped 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain on parts of New England and flooded streets on Martha's Vineyard.

Our medications are leaking into waterways — and may be changing fish behavior
Some days, he was only able to make it a little over half a mile (1 kilometer) before wind and waves made it impossible to see beyond an arm's length ahead. In some cases, he had to make up lost distance by swimming multiple legs in a day.
""I was just getting really cold and swallowing a lot of sea water, not making headway and then you're constantly thinking, 'Are we taking the right route here? Should we go further out to sea? Should we get closer in?'"" he said. ""And meanwhile you're fighting currents.""

Endurance swimmer's latest feat is meant to help protect sharks
But Pugh — who has been named a United Nations Patron of the Oceans and often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes — said no swim is without risk, and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: About 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day, a rate of nearly 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
On Monday, Pugh called the decimation of sharks an ""ecocide.""
""I think protecting sharks is the most important part of the jigsaw puzzle of protecting the oceans,"" he said.

""Jaws,"" which was filmed in Edgartown, and called Amity Island for the movie, created Hollywood's blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, setting new box office records and earning three Academy Awards. The movie would shape views of the ocean for decades to come.
Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley expressed regret that viewers of the film became so afraid of sharks, and both later contributed to conservation efforts as their populations declined, largely due to commercial fishing.
Pugh's endeavor also coincided with the New England Aquarium's first confirmed sighting this season of a white shark, off the nearby island of Nantucket. As a precaution, Pugh was accompanied on his swim by safety personnel in a boat and a kayak, whose paddler is using a ""Shark Shield"" device to create a low-intensity electric field in the water to deter sharks without harming them.
What Does It Mean To Be 'All-American'?
There were no shark sightings along Pugh's journey, but he said he saw sun fish, seals and terns.
He now plans to travel to New York for a few days to do interviews about the swim and discuss shark conservation before returning to his home of Plymouth, England.
""Now the real hard work starts, which is getting this message to policy makers,"" Pugh said.

Yara Haridy
, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, likes to stun people by telling them that our skeletons evolved from a jawless fish.
""Much of what we have today has been around for upwards of 500 million years,"" she says of the bony structures in our bodies. ""And getting people to understand that, I think, gives them a better appreciation for their Earth, for the environment, and sometimes for one another.""
Now, Haridy has a new surprise to share. In work that she and her colleagues have published in the journal
Nature
, they find that the sensitivity of our teeth (which causes them to ache and zing when confronted with an icy treat or a dentist's drill) can be traced back to the exoskeletons of those ancient, armored fish.
Sponsor Message
An ancient case of mistaken identity
The reason that you or your dog or the bird outside aren't puddles of flesh and muscle is because all our soft stuff hangs together on internal scaffolding — a skeleton. That skeleton is what makes us vertebrates.
And Haridy wanted to know: How did our skeletons first come to be?
""Why are we not goopy creatures?"" she asks. ""Before there was bone, there was no bone. What happened in between? Making a new skeleton is a brand new thing that hadn't existed in evolutionary history, so I want to know how those cells evolved this ability and what tissue they made first.""
Haridy decided to look for clues in what was considered the earliest vertebrate on record from roughly 500 million years ago, something called
Anatolepis
.
""It's unfortunately probably the world's least-exciting-looking fossil,"" she says. That's because it's just a smattering of these tiny bumpy flakes, ""thought to be the scales of this ancient fish-like thing,"" forming a kind of armor.
Because the
Anatolepis
fragments hadn't been imaged in detail before, Haridy and a small team booked time at the
Argonne National Laboratory's
particle accelerator to use its powerful X-rays to get hi-res 3D scans.
Sponsor Message
""You get to stay overnight in a really crazy building full of vacuums,"" recalls Haridy. ""Everything's chrome — it looks like it's out of The Terminator.""
For those 24 hours, she ate a lot of pizza — not deep dish, though.
""I just can't — it's so much dough and cheese,"" she says. ""I'm not a deep dish person. Oh, that's going to get me canceled in Chicago!""
Back in the lab, when Haridy analyzed her scans, she noticed something bizarre. ""I just expected to see a really simple structure,"" she says. ""But instead, it was just too much anatomy and too much complexity.""
Weekly Dose of Wonder
This fossil of a mammal biting a dinosaur captures a death battle's final moments
The reason, it turned out, was that
Anatolepis
was no vertebrate. It was an invertebrate — a kind of arthropod. ""Think of it like an ancestor of spiders and scorpions,"" she says.
This discovery pushed the emergence of vertebrates some 20 to 30 million years later than once thought.
But the finding was hard for Haridy to stomach. She'd built her whole study around
Anatolepis
being the earliest vertebrate — when it actually wasn't a vertebrate at all.
""It signified that my project was almost broken,"" she says. ""I was so crushed.""
Letting the teeth do the talking
Haridy's advisor at the University of Chicago, paleontologist
Neil Shubin
, helped her reframe her thinking and take the project in a different direction by considering an alternative question.
The anatomy of these flakes of invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates. Why was that? In other words, says Haridy, ""What problem are these two animals solving that gave them such similar structures?""
Science
Small fossil has big implications for bird brain evolution
Shubin wondered whether maybe it had something to do with sensitivity. There's the fact that human teeth are sensitive. Plus, the structure that Haridy had found in
Anatolepis
(the now-arthropod) was for sensing. ""All this extra anatomy,"" she says, ""it's to sense pressure or to sense chemistry in the air or water.""
So Haridy turned to ancient vertebrate fish whose bumpy exoskeletons scientists believe evolved into our teeth. ""As fish evolved a jaw and started to feed more like predators,"" she says, ""it becomes very advantageous to have pointy things around your mouth."" But no one had known whether there was more to the armor than self-defense.
Sponsor Message
When Haridy scanned the animal's fossilized bumps, the anatomy was very similar to
Anatolepis
. ""These early vertebrates, they lived in mucky, shallow-bottomed seas."" she says. ""The visibility probably wasn't great. They probably needed every inch of sensation they can get. What we couldn't ask from the fossils is, 'Hey, ancient fish, were those teeth sensitive?'""
Haridy figured that modern-day fish might help her answer the question. So she looked at the tooth-like scales of the embryos of sharks, skates and catfish — and she found nerves.
Combined, these results suggested that the armor of ancient fish likely allowed them to sense the water around them. Hundreds of millions of years later, our teeth — which evolved from that armor — have inherited that same ability to sense things like pain and temperature.
""That means those scales were useful every step of the way,"" says Haridy. ""And they just changed through time. And that's the story of evolution.""
Joseph Keating
, a paleobiologist at the University of Bristol who wasn't involved in the study, says unraveling skeletal evolution may help us understand the abnormalities that sometimes arise in our own skeletons.
""The developmental mechanisms that control bone growth — especially growth of the skull roof — are ancient and evolved first in jawless [fishlike animals] 480 million years ago,"" he says. There are a handful of rare diseases ""where those ancient developmental mechanisms go awry.""
In addition, the results of the new research explain why we get toothaches. ""It's written in our evolutionary history,"" says Keating.
""It's because once upon a time,"" Keating adds, ""your great great great many times over grandparent was a jawless fish swimming in the sea, sensing its environment through tooth-like structures on its body.""
These, he says, are ""the evolutionary predecessors of the teeth in your mouth."""

A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are not only keeping up with human influence on their habitat, they're thriving.
According to a recent study in
Global Change Biology
, a journal focused on environmental change, the use and prevalence of hummingbird feeders — like those red and clear plastic ones filled with homemade sugar water — changed the size and shape of the birds' beaks. The range of the hummingbird also spread from the southern part of California all the way up the West coast into Canada.
""Very simplified, the bills get longer and they become more slender, and that helps to have a larger tongue inside that can get more nectar from the feeder at a time,"" says Alejandro Rico-Guevara, a professor of biology at the University of Washington and senior author on the study.

Science
Birds can change their tunes as their populations evolve, researchers find
The study, which had been in the works since 2019 and had 16 collaborators across 12 different institutions, also found that the beaks of males grew pointier over time to allow them to fight off competing males at the feeders. The hummingbirds also moved further north, eventually showing up in much cooler temperatures as they chased the growing popularity of the bird feeders. The study also noted the influence of the growing abundance of eucalyptus forests, another human-influenced food source for the hummingbirds as the trees were introduced to California from Australia in the 1900s.
Hummingbird history
During the research process, the study authors sifted  through newspaper archives in California, tracking hummingbird feeder mentions by county and comparing that to census data and scientific bird counts.
They also studied museum specimens of Anna's Hummingbirds dating back to the 1800s — well before the popular outdoor bird feeders existed — providing a range of beaks to measure over about 10 generations of the species.
Simon English, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia and one of the co-authors of the study, helped comb through all the data to  figure out how it all fit together.
""The contribution of the feeders was remarkable,"" he says. ""As far as a single contribution to an effect that humans have, it was very strong, very surprising.""

Faye Romero, now a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester and also a co-author on the study, says she spent many  of her undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley measuring those old hummingbird museum specimens, helping to gather the data to show the physical change of the birds.
""It's a really interesting example of how our actions as humans are actively changing the organisms around us,"" she says, noting that in this case, the birds are keeping up. ""But because they're keeping up now doesn't mean they will forever, or all the other organisms will keep up, too.""
Humanity's influence
Richard Prum is an evolutionary ornithologist at Yale University, who was not involved in the study, but has read it.
""Human behavior and human environments have greatly affected the evolution of birds, and in lots of ways,"" he says.
He points to the domestication of wild junglefowl to create what we now call a chicken, for example. Or the common pigeon, also called the rock dove, which originally nested on cliff faces in remote areas.
""But of course, that choice of nesting on a rock face is a lot like a building, yeah? So we build buildings, and it turns out we have just provided a huge amount of habitat for nesting rock doves or pigeons,"" Prum says.

He said he thinks Anna's Hummingbird expansion north could be ""just the beginning of the story,"" and it's unclear what effect that could have, good or bad.
""That's a huge question,"" he says.
Rico-Guevara, the senior author of the study, says for him one of the biggest takeaways was just how quickly evolution — something generally assumed to happen over millions of years — can take place.
""It's a demonstration of how evolution happens, like, literally in front of our eyes. And we just need to pay attention to it,"" he says."

Pushback on environmental justice
The Trump administration removed EJScreen in February after signing an executive order called ""Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.""
The EPA put nearly 200 employees who worked at the
Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on paid administrative
leave in February. Then the agency sent nearly 300 letters to staffers in the Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights office on April 28 warning they could be fired.
EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in an email these moves are ""organizational improvements"" that meet President Trump's executive orders and will ""ensure the EPA is best positioned to meet its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and powering the great American Comeback.""
Vaseliou also said that environmental justice has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of addressing specific environmental issues.
""When President Trump speaks about a Golden Age for America, that is for all Americans regardless of race, gender, creed, and background,"" she says. ""Under the Trump Administration, EPA is affirming our commitment to serve every American with equal dignity and respect.""
Andrea Issod, a senior attorney at Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program, says despite what the Trump administration says, the data is clear.
""They're exposed to hazardous waste, industrial pollution, and toxic emissions due to unfair policies like redlining and segregation,"" she says. ""So this problem the Biden administration set out to prioritize and we only made minor progress.""

The road ahead
Another petrochemical company, Formosa Plastics Group, plans to set up a complex that would house 14 petrochemical facilities in St. James. That's the unincorporated area about 30 minutes from St. John.
The air permits Formosa needed were vacated in 2022 after a judge ruled that the plastics company failed to show how the plant would impact air quality in an area that's around 90% Black. A Louisiana district court determined — with EJScreen data — that the plant ""violated"" the Clean Air Act.
However, a Louisiana appeals court overturned that decision in 2024. Now the Formosa project is moving forward. FG LA LLC, a subsidiary of Formosa, said in an email that it will uphold its commitment to operate safely and listen to community concerns.
""We are constructing this project with advanced emissions reduction mechanisms in place and extensive measures to protect the environment, and also plan to keep pace with technological advances that may enable the company to further strengthen those measures,"" said Janile Parks, a company spokesperson, in an email statement.
""As the project continues forward, FG will uphold its commitment to operate.""

But the process has dragged on so long that Kim Terrell with Tulane, says the air permits Formosa needs to operate have come up for renewal.
"" I think EJScreen sort of remains relevant to this case because pollution burdens have only increased over the last couple years, but now the public has one less tool than it had before for making their case,"" Terrell says.
Researchers, including those at the Environmental Data Governance Initiative,
helped archive EJScreen
, but if federal data isn't updated, the tool becomes obsolete. That's why the Sierra Club and other groups have
filed a lawsuit against the federal government
to get EJScreen back on the EPA's website where it can be updated with current data.

She and others in the river parishes have built a community where neighbors helped build each other's homes and children play outside. Many of the families in the river parishes, she says, can trace their lineage back hundreds of years to this land. That's what keeps her and others motivated to fight for clean air and water. ""The fight is about democracy and equal justice under the law,"" LeBoeuf says."

President Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at boosting nuclear power and restructuring the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission during an Oval Office event on Friday.
""It's time. It's time for nuclear and we're going to do it very big,"" President Trump told reporters, while flanked by executives from the nuclear industry.
NPR had previously
reported on the executive orders
, which have been circulating for several weeks.
One order calls for major reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent agency that oversees America's nuclear reactors. The order calls for approvals of new nuclear reactor designs to be completed in no more than 18 months. It also asks the agency to reconsider strict radiation standards that are currently used to ensure safety for workers and the public. Finally, it would require restructuring of the NRC itself and a wide-ranging revision of regulations to be conducted in conjunction with the White House and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
Sponsor Message
Some members of the nuclear industry applauded the reform. ""The safety regulations that we put in place were largely reactionary to Three Mile Island,"" says Isaiah Taylor, CEO and Founder of Valar Atomics, a startup that seeks to build small modular reactors. ""You know there's a lot of advanced reactor architectures that just don't share the same characteristics as the reactors that we were building in the 60s and 70s.""
But others say the executive order has the potential to undermine nuclear safety. ""An independent regulator is one who is free from industry and political influence,"" says Allison Macfarlane, director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia in Canada who was nominated by President Obama to serve as chair of the NRC from 2012 to 2014. ""Once you insert the White House into the process, you don't have an independent regulator anymore.""
The NRC has already been trying to reform itself. Last year, Congress passed a bipartisan law designed to accelerate the approval of new reactor designs.
As a result of the law, some changes were already underway. For example, approving reactor designs within 18 months can be done, ""without sacrificing safety,"" says a senior NRC official, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press about the executive orders.
Sponsor Message
But outsiders are worried that if the agency is shaken up as promised, it could actually end up slowing approvals. The White House is already requiring that it be allowed to review new rules from the agency, adding time to its regulatory process, and a major reorganization could further slow things down.
Trump's executive orders also call for accelerating nuclear research at national laboratories around the U.S., building nuclear reactors on federal lands and the resumption of uranium mining and enrichment on American soil.
Trump signed the executive order flanked by executives and CEOs from large and small nuclear companies. Many seemed jubilant.
""Thank you Mr. President,"" said Jacob DeWitte, the CEO of Oklo, a startup seeking to build small nuclear reactors. ""Changing the permitting dynamics is going to help things move faster. We're seeing private investment move into this space like we've never seen before.""
Oklo had a combined license for its experimental Aurora reactor denied by the NRC in 2022 due to ""significant information gaps in its description of Aurora's potential accidents,"" according to a
press release
from the agency.
Oklo's stock was up around 25% today.
Macfarlane says she doubts these executive orders will fundamentally change the fact that nuclear power remains costly to develop and build. But she's worried about the consequences.
""I'm very concerned this could affect nuclear safety in the U.S.,"" she says.
In addition to the suite of executive orders concerning nuclear energy in the U.S., President Trump also signed an executive order calling on science agencies to adhere to a ""Gold Standard."" The order says that federal scientific agencies have, in the past, used scientific information in what it called a ""highly misleading manner,"" citing COVID-19 restrictions and dire warnings over climate change as examples.
Under the order, federal scientists would be required to make their data and scientific models open to public scrutiny and explain the uncertainty in their models on such subjects as climate change. The order comes as the Trump Administration has pushed out thousands of employees from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's also seeking to
slash funding for basic research
in next year's budget."

The cost of homeowners insurance is soaring in states where large
outbreaks of tornadoes
are becoming more common. But it's hail — not tornadoes — that are the biggest concern for insurers in the middle of the country, according to industry experts and analysts.
Insurance companies have been raising their rates as the cost of extreme weather disasters grows. In Kentucky, where at least
19 people died
after a tornado tore through communities last week, premiums are up 35% from a few years ago,
according to the Consumer Federation of America
. It's a similar picture throughout the region. Rates are up 35% in Nebraska, 34% in Arkansas, 32% in Minnesota and 27% in Texas, Colorado and Iowa.

""Even though tornadoes are a much more significant threat to life, most of the insured damages associated with severe weather come from hail,"" says Scott St. George, head of weather and climate research at insurance broker WTW. ""And the reason for that is because tornadoes are awful and they're severe, but the footprint of those storms, the areas that are affected by them, is usually still pretty small.""
Hailstorms, on the other hand, cause damage across much larger areas. Hailstones, which can break windows,
tear off siding
and dent and
even puncture
roofing material, account for between half and 80% of homeowner insurance claims annually from severe convective storms — thunderstorms that can produce hail and tornadoes — according to St. George.
""My sense from the insurance industry is that hail has become an increasing contributor to claims in recent years due to frequency and severity,"" says Ben Keys, a real estate and finance professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And so that is driving insurers to respond by raising premiums.""
It's part of a trend that's happening across the country. Insurance premiums have risen 24% on average in recent years, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Insurers say they have to raise rates because disasters are getting more expensive. People continue to move to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to rural parts of the western U.S. that are prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. And when homes get damaged or destroyed, inflation has made it more expensive to rebuild.

impact on tornadoes
and hailstorms is still very much an area of active research.

'Insurers are going to follow the same playbook'
There's been an above-average number of tornadoes in the Midwest so far this year,
according to data collected by the National Weather Service
. That's not evidence of a long-term trend. But tornado patterns are changing in other ways.
For example, large tornado outbreaks, like the ones in
Kentucky and Missouri
last week, are becoming more common, though scientists aren't sure why. There's also some evidence that the timing of tornadoes in the U.S. might shift, with more forming in the fall and winter. That could be because warm, wet air is an ingredient for tornadoes, and those conditions are becoming more common at times of the year that used to be colder and drier.
As for hail, a team of scientists last year said that
as the Earth heats up
, storms
could produce larger hailstones
due to changes in the atmosphere.
""The public is more aware of the wildfires and hurricanes and so on, but I assure you, the insurance industry is very aware of the severe convective storms and tornadoes and associated hail,"" says David Marlett, managing director of the Brantley Risk & Insurance Center at Appalachian State University.
""Insurers are going to follow the same playbook"" they've used in response to other threats, Marlett says. ""They're going to scale back coverage primarily on the roofs"" — for example, by covering the value of a damaged roof rather than the cost of buying a new one — ""and they are going to attempt to increase rates to match the risk.""
In some states, homeowners can qualify for insurance discounts if they make their homes more resilient, including by installing fortified roofs. But the discounts are often relatively small, so the investments usually take a long time to pay off.
Sponsor Message
""For the average homeowner, buying a $15,000 roof versus getting an $80 drop in your insurance just isn't worth it for them,"" says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.
""When they're thinking about bills that they have to pay for that year or for that month or even that week, it just doesn't make sense for them financially to put on a new roof, because they're not thinking long term,"" Porter adds. ""They're thinking about the here and now and today.""
And while fortified roofs offer protection in hailstorms, tornadoes are a different story. Insurance experts say there's only so much stronger roofs and tougher building codes can do in the face of big tornadoes.
""At some point with a tornado, you simply can't build a structure that's going to withstand that,"" Marlett says."

The website that hosts the most recent edition of the National Climate Assessment
has gone dark
. The sprawling report is the most influential source of information about how climate change affects the United States.
The National Climate Assessment is widely used by teachers, city planners, farmers, judges and regular citizens looking for answers to common questions such as how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure. The most recent edition had a searchable atlas that allowed anyone to learn about the current and future effects of global warming in their specific town or state.

On Monday, the government website that hosts all of that information stopped working.
The Trump administration had already
halted work
on the next edition of the report, and fired all the staff who worked on it.
The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate report website was taken down, or whether the administration plans to create the next edition of the climate assessment as Congress mandates.
Congress requires the federal government to publish the National Climate Assessment every four years. The last edition was published in 2023, and underscored the degree to which climate change is
expensive, deadly and preventable
.
""If you are a human being in the United States, your life is already being impacted by climate change whether you know it or not,"" says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist who was one of the authors of the report. ""If we don't recognize that, it's simply because we haven't connected the dots. And the National Climate Assessment was one of the primary tools connecting those dots.""
The next edition was supposed to be released in 2027, and about 400 volunteer authors had started working on it. That work stopped after all the federal staff who coordinate it were let go in April.

The deep ocean covers most of the planet. Gerard Barron wants his company to be the first to mine it.
That's been his dream since 2001, when Barron's then-tennis partner asked him to invest in a first-of-its-kind project to extract gold and other metals from a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Papua New Guinea.
""I knew very little about the ocean. I knew very little about mining,"" Barron told NPR. ""But I was curious.""
Climate
The world has no rulebook for deep-sea mining. One company is pushing forward anyway
Barron, 58, is a serial entrepreneur from Australia who always seems to be in a different time zone — calling from Vancouver, London or Dubai. He's founded companies in fields ranging from finance to industrial manufacturing.
That
first deep-sea mining
project
didn't quite go as planned. The company struggled to attract financing and went bankrupt in 2019, though not before Barron sold his stake at a profit.
Along the way, he learned about a different, potentially more lucrative, opportunity: ""The big game was this nodule field off the coast of Mexico.""
Sponsor Message
That ""big game"" is a remote stretch of the Pacific Ocean, believed to hold massive amounts of minerals like nickel and cobalt. It would become the target of his latest firm,
The Metals Company
.
Barron argues that securing access to those minerals, which are used in defense and energy technologies, could help usher in a new era of industrialization for the U.S.
"" This resource can help America become mineral independent, just like it became energy independent through shale and gas,"" he says.
That argument has caught the attention of the Trump administration. The Metals Company is now seeking approval for the project from federal regulators – the first time U.S. agencies have considered such a project.
But scientists worry about the impact of deep-sea mining on a little-studied ecosystem. And most other countries say these minerals, which fall beneath international waters, aren't even America's to mine.

What is The Metals Company?
The Metals Company is a relative newcomer to the mining industry. It was founded in 2011 and went public in 2021. It's backed by companies including the engineering firm Allseas, which designs much of The Metals Company's mining technology.
It is among a handful of mining firms eyeing the same stretch of Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii, called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The U.S. Geological Survey
has estimated
that the seabed there contains more nickel and cobalt than all known terrestrial reserves combined.
Climate
Your Next Car May Be Built With Ocean Rocks. Scientists Can't Agree If That's Good
Barron, who became CEO in 2017, says mining in the CCZ is a no-brainer. Unlike traditional mining, which extracts metals from underground, the metals in the CCZ sit right on the seabed surface, bound up in trillions of potato-shaped rocks called polymetallic nodules.
""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" Barron says. ""We can pick those nodules up and turn them into metals at a fraction of the environmental and human impacts compared to mining on land.""
Polymetallic nodules containing certain critical minerals can be found scattered across the seabed in some parts of the ocean. Pictured here are manganese nodules found off the Southeastern U.S. in 2019. ""They literally sit there like golf balls on a driving range,"" says Gerard Barron, CEO of The Metals Company. The company hopes to mine a region in the Pacific called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

In 2022, The Metals Company tested its mining system in the miles-deep waters of the CCZ. The technology works something like a giant, remote-controlled vacuum cleaner that sucks nodules off the seafloor. In that test, the firm retrieved 3,000 tons of nodules from the seabed, a feat unmatched by most industry peers.

By operating in the remote CCZ, Barron says his company can avoid the harms of land-based mining, which can include displacing communities or clearing forest.
""This is the perfect place,"" he says ""There's no alternative [use] for this part of the seafloor. You can't grow crops there. People can't live there. It's perfect.""
Not everyone agrees.

Dozens of countries have
called for a moratorium
on deep-sea mining until more is learned about potential impacts, and hundreds of marine researchers have also come out

Scientists are raising the alarm about Trump's deep sea mining executive order
They say mining could damage a little-explored ecosystem where scientists still routinely discover new animal species.
""On land, we all see how destructive mining is. But on the seafloor, no one's going to see it,"" says Sheryl Murdock, an oceanographer at Arizona State University. ""So I don't think it's going to be less destructive. It's that people are going to be less aware of it.""
Murdock says deep-sea mining could destroy seabed habitat by removing the nodules on which sponges and other animals live. The operation would also create underwater plumes of sediment that may contain heavy metals, she says.
The Metals Company says its mining system is designed to limit environmental impacts. It plans to leave 15-20% of the nodules behind on the seabed, allowing some animals to recolonize the disturbed area. The firm says that its models suggest the sediment plumes would dissipate to background levels within two miles, only impacting the area immediately surrounding the mining operation.
The firm also points to
studies
finding that animal life in the CCZ is far less abundant than in many terrestrial mining hotspots.
Still, some manufacturers — including Volvo, BMW and Google — have
pledged
not to use ocean-mined minerals in their supply chains due to environmental concerns.
Some analysts also question the business case for deep-sea mining. Many EV carmakers have
shifted away
from using batteries that contain nickel and cobalt. There's currently a
global
oversupply
of those metals — even some terrestrial mines are going idle.
Andrew K. Sweetman, professor and research leader at the Lyell Centre for Earth, Marine Science, and Technology at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland explains how sample are obtained from deep in the ocean during research in 2021 on the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining. Many ocean researchers have raised concerns about the potential effects on an ecosystem that scientists still know relatively little about.

A 'lifeline' from the Trump administration
Just a few months ago, it wasn't clear any company would be mining the deep sea any time soon.

Mining in international waters is traditionally overseen by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). For more than a decade, the United Nations-affiliated group of more than 165 countries has been drafting regulations for a future deep-sea mining industry. Those regulations are still being negotiated – leaving companies like Barron's in limbo.
World
The global race for rare earth materials is on, and the U.S. is losing it
In April, Barron's fortunes changed. President Trump signed an
executive order
promoting deep-sea mining as a way for the U.S. to counter China's dominance of global mineral supplies. It also directed federal agencies to fast-track permitting for deep-sea mining projects, in both federal and international waters.
""The industry got a lifeline with the Trump executive order,"" says Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Everything else was kind of on a backwards treadmill.""
The order also put the U.S. at odds with nearly every other country.
""The area is an international possession,"" says Leticia Reis de Carvalho, Secretary-General of the ISA. ""Therefore, any activity without an authorization of the International Seabed Authority constitutes a violation of international law.""
The ISA defines these seabed minerals as the common heritage of all humans. Dozens of countries have condemned the Trump administration's unilateral approach to mining them.
The Trump administration says it's not bound by ISA rules. The U.S. is one of the few countries that never ratified the treaty that created the ISA, though past administrations have generally cooperated with it.
The executive order seems to have buoyed The Metals Company's prospects. Its stock price has more than doubled since Trump's signing. The firm has also announced $85 million-worth of new corporate
investment
.

What comes next?
Barron plans to seize the newfound opportunity. Days after the executive order, The Metals Company
officially applied for approval
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to begin commercial-scale mining in international waters.
NOAA
says
it is ""committed to an expeditious review"" of the application, though an exact timeline is unclear, since the agency has never conducted such a review.
If and when The Metals Company receives approval, it will likely take
at least a year
to build out a full-scale mining system, according to the engineering firm Allseas.

Deep-sea nodules were first discovered more than a century ago. Now, Barron says The Metals Company is on the cusp of hauling them up from the seabed on a commercial scale: ""I'm certain it will be while Trump is president."""

The U.S. Department of Defense will no longer provide satellite weather data, leaving hurricane forecasters without crucial information about storms as peak hurricane season looms in the Atlantic.
For more than 40 years, the Defense Department has operated satellites that collect information about conditions in the atmosphere and ocean. A group within the Navy, called the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, processes the raw data from the satellites, and turns it over to scientists and weather forecasters who use it for a wide range of purposes including real-time hurricane forecasting and measuring sea ice in polar regions.
Sponsor Message
In late June, the Department of Defense announced that it would no longer provide that data, according to a
notice published
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. The termination date was originally the end of June, but after an outcry from scientists and forecasters, it was updated to the end of July, according to the Navy.
""I was surprised, given how important it is for forecasting hurricanes and monitoring important features like sea ice,"" says Brian Tang, a hurricane researcher at the University at Albany. ""This is data that forecasters use regularly.""
The Navy did not respond to questions about why it has stopped sharing the data with scientists and forecasters.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Space Force, which is responsible for the satellites, said in a statement that the satellites and instruments are still functional, and the Department of Defense will continue to use them even as it cuts off access for scientists.
""It's not an issue of funding cuts,"" says Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a federally funded research center in Colorado that has relied on the soon-to-be-terminated Defense Department data to track sea ice since 1979. ""There are cybersecurity concerns. That's what we're being told.""
Sponsor Message
The Navy did not respond to questions about what those specific concerns might be. In a statement, a Navy spokesperson wrote only that, ""the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.""
Tracking hurricanes as they form
The Department of Defense collects satellite weather information because it has ships and planes operating all over the world, and needs information about conditions in the oceans and atmosphere.
But the Defense Department data also allow hurricane forecasters to see hurricanes as they form, and monitor them in real-time.
""What we can do with the data is we can see the structure of hurricanes,"" Tang explains, ""Sort of like an MRI or X-ray.""
For example, hurricane experts can see where the center of a newly formed storm is, which allows them to figure out as early as possible what direction it is likely to go, and whether the storm might hit land. That's important for people in harm's way, who need as much time as possible to decide whether to evacuate, and to prepare their homes for wind and water.
The data also allows forecasters to see when a new eyewall has formed in the center of the storm, which can indicate that the hurricane is about to intensify. For example, Tang says, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used the data from Defense Department satellites to observe a circular eyewall forming in Hurricane Erick earlier this month as it moved over the Pacific.
""That was a really good indication that the storm was about to intensify much more quickly than the computer models indicated it was going to intensify,"" Tang says, which allows forecasters to publish early warnings. The storm hit Mexico as a destructive Category 3 hurricane.
NOAA, which oversees the National Hurricane Center, says the loss of the Defense Department data will not lead to less-accurate hurricane forecasts this year. In a statement, NOAA communications director Kim Doster said, ""NOAA's data sources are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.""
Sponsor Message
Other satellites, operated by NASA and NOAA and by other countries, collect similar data, Tang says. But hurricanes form and intensify so rapidly that forecasters need near real-time information, which requires as many satellites as possible since no one sensor is always pointed at a given storm. Without the Defense Department data, there will be bigger gaps in time when forecasters will not know the current conditions inside a storm. That could lead forecasters to be surprised when a hurricane suddenly intensifies.
That's particularly concerning because, as the Earth heats up, large, rapidly intensifying hurricanes are
getting more common
. Storms that gather strength quickly right before they hit land are particularly deadly because people have little time to prepare and evacuate.

A scramble to keep monitoring sea ice
The Defense Department satellites were also the main source of real-time information about
changes to sea ice
.
Sea ice data is important for a lot of reasons. Permanent sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic is shrinking rapidly because of climate change, and the exact amount of ice fluctuates dramatically over the course of each year.
In any given year or season, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic informs international shipping decisions, because when there is less sea ice around the North Pole, ships can take shorter routes across the globe.
On the other end of the planet, sea ice helps slow the melting of glaciers in Antarctica, which threaten the planet with
catastrophic sea level rise if they collapse
.
Now, as a result of the Defense Department's decision, six widely used datasets about sea ice at both poles will be interrupted, according to the
National Snow and Ice Data Center
.
""We've been very reliant on these data for many years,"" explains Serreze, the director of the center. He says the Defense Department had warned him that the data would no longer be available after September.

Serreze's team had already planned to switch to an alternate source of sea ice information: a sensor on a satellite
operated by the Japanese government
. The U.S. has access to data from that sensor through an agreement between NASA and the Japanese government's space agency.
But they thought they had months to make the switch, which requires a lot of labor-intensive calibration.
And this is happening in the middle of a record-breaking year: so far in 2025 there is
less sea ice in the Arctic
than any other year since satellite records began in 1979."

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development,

Congressional Republicans are

that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.
Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.
""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term
Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development,
according to SEIA
.
This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.
Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.
Climate
U.S. electricity demand is set to explode. That will make it harder to cut climate pollution
But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018,
Trump approved tariffs
on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent
post on Truth Social
, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.
Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies,
according to the financial firm Lazard
. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.
Sponsor Message
If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""
Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which
announced it was building a Georgia solar factory
in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.
""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""
The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.
""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell
Pakistan

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer
Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.
However,
tariffs on their own weren't enough
to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.
But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.
Legislative text
released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout
The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.
Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to
a study this winter
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.
""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.
Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.
Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.
""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.
Reams' group has
called for lawmakers
to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""
Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.
""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""
With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.
""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese."""

President Trump says the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, should be eliminated, and that states should take on more responsibility for responding to and preparing for extreme weather and other disasters.
That would mean big changes for the millions of Americans who rely on FEMA after hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods and other weather disasters every year. The cost of weather disasters in the U.S. has skyrocketed in the last decade, as climate change causes more intense weather and populations grow in areas that are at high risk for hurricanes, wildfires and other destructive events.
Sponsor Message
FEMA currently works with states to prepare for disasters, provides on-the-ground help during emergencies and pays out billions of dollars for repairs. Emergency management experts and state disaster response officials say that FEMA plays a crucial role that
state governments cannot handle on their own
.
Here's what we know about the Trump administration's plans to eliminate FEMA.
When will FEMA be eliminated?
President Trump says the agency could be eliminated as soon as December 2025. Speaking in the Oval Office in June, he said that major changes to FEMA would come after the Atlantic hurricane season ends in November. ""We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it back to the state level,"" the president said. He also said that the agency will immediately ""give out less money"" to states that are recovering from disasters.
The president also
appointed a council
of cabinet members, governors and emergency management experts, tasked with recommending changes to FEMA. That group, the FEMA Review Council, had its first meeting in May, and is supposed to make recommendations by mid-November. The council is expected to complete its work by May 2026, suggesting that the Trump administration intends to eliminate or restructure FEMA in the period between the 2025 hurricane season and the 2026 hurricane season.
Sponsor Message
Why is the Trump administration proposing this?
FEMA has a long history of failing to serve those who need help the most after disasters. Under the Biden administration, the agency was
taking steps to address those problems
. For example, the agency simplified paperwork, expanded on-the-ground help after disasters and made it easier for survivors to get money for diapers, food and other immediate needs.
The Trump administration is taking a different approach. The president has repeatedly suggested that FEMA is hopelessly flawed. At the first meeting of the FEMA Review Council, the council's co-chair, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said, ""The president and I have had many, many discussions about this agency. I want to be very clear. The President wants it eliminated as it currently exists. He wants a new agency.""
Doesn't Congress oversee FEMA?
Yes, and only Congress can fully eliminate FEMA, although the executive branch can act on its own to restructure or reduce the size of the agency.
Congress has its own ideas about how to reform FEMA. A
bipartisan bill
making its way through Congress would simplify the process for disaster survivors to apply for federal assistance, and remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security, giving the agency a direct line to the president.
That bill would also incentivize states to invest more in disaster preparedness, by tying it to federal aid after a disaster. The bill's focus on preparation as a core FEMA responsibility is at odds with the Trump administration's approach to reforming the agency, which has so far included
drastically cutting FEMA's disaster preparedness spending
.
What specific FEMA changes are being proposed by the Trump administration?
The president has suggested that the federal government should have a much smaller role in responding to disasters. But it's unclear what that means in practice.
Sponsor Message
At the first meeting of the FEMA Review Council, Secretary Noem said she supports a simplified payment system wherein states receive large disaster recovery block grants from the federal government, rather than tailored reimbursements and grants to cover specific repairs. And President Trump said in June that FEMA will provide less disaster-related assistance to states overall.
Bloomberg news also reported that an
internal agency memo from March
confirmed that agency leaders were considering changing FEMA's policies to make it harder for states to receive funding after disasters.
Other members of the review council suggested shrinking FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, which provides the majority of residential flood insurance in the U.S. And FEMA has already
canceled billions of dollars
of grants for infrastructure upgrades that were supposed to prevent future damage from extreme weather.
Is FEMA ready to respond to disasters right now?
By many measures, FEMA appears less ready to respond to disasters than it was before President Trump took office.
The acting FEMA director, Cameron Hamilton, was
abruptly let go in the spring
. He was replaced by David Richardson, a DHS official who has no prior emergency management experience.
After Richardson took over,
Reuters reported
more than a dozen top FEMA employees resigned, including the then-second in command at the agency. In June, the head of the agency's disaster coordination
office resigned
.
And changes to other parts of the federal government have also affected FEMA. An AmeriCorps program which trained and deployed young people to help after disasters was canceled because of an executive order signed in the early days of Trump's second term. And the Department of Homeland Security, which usually supplies
extra staff for FEMA
after particularly large disasters, is already
stretched thin
because of the administration's focus on arresting and deporting people."

A heat dome is bringing oppressive heat to the eastern half of the contiguous U.S., with forecasters warning people in those areas to take precautions to cope with extreme high temperatures. The phenomenon occurs when high pressure lingers and traps warm air near the surface, while also suppressing clouds and precipitation.

What is a heat dome?
""It almost acts like a lid on a pot,"" the National Weather Service's Alex Lamers told NPR, discussing how a heat dome works. Lamers is the operations branch chief at the Weather Prediction Center.
""If you've made grilled cheese in a pan and you put a lid on there, it melts the cheese faster because the lid helps trap the heat,"" Lamers said. ""It's a similar concept here: You get a big high-pressure system in the upper parts of the atmosphere and it allows that heat to build underneath over multiple days.""

Planning to be outside on a hot and humid day? Take these precautions
That's right: days, or even weeks.
A heat dome is basically a massive area of high pressure and warm air that ""parks"" over a region. The exact location is generally linked to the jet stream — and right now, the
jet stream is moving sharply to the northeast
, from the upper Baja California peninsula to a spot just west of Lake Michigan. That allows a heat dome to persist in much of the eastern half of the U.S.
When a heat dome sits over a large land area, it can form a sort of feedback loop, Lamers said, adding that high pressure typically means dry weather, which can help drive the heat even higher.

major heat wave
continues to create dangerous conditions across the Midwest and along the East Coast. That heat is expected to last through midweek, and in some areas until Friday. On Tuesday, some places
from the Carolinas to the East Coast
saw daily temperature records shattered as temps climbed into the triple digits.
Early season heat can be especially dangerous because people's bodies have not had time
to get used to hot temperatures
. Every year, people end up in the emergency room for heat-related complications including heat stroke. But there are ways to keep your home and yourself cool.

5 simple (and cheap) things to make your house use less energy
Staying cool indoors
The majority
of American homes have some kind of
air conditioning. But some people are nervous about stressing their AC in the heat.
To help cool your home, make sure window blinds and curtains are closed to help keep the sun's heat out.
If you have fans
, keep them next to you. Now is not the time to be baking or turning on the oven. A wet sheet can help your body cool down at night.
The best solution during a heat wave is to avoid being outside during the hottest parts of the day and staying inside as much as possible. If you do have to be outside, drink water — and then drink more, and more. Also, wear a brimmed hat.

Air conditioning
You'll hear a lot of advice about what exact temperature to set your thermostat at during a heat wave. The reality is every house is different, and there's no one answer.
But an important tip is to make sure your air conditioner's filters are clean, says
Kevin Kircher
, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University. ""If you don't know when your filters were last replaced, it's probably time,"" he writes in an email.
""For folks who don't have air conditioning,"" Kircher says, ""or whose air conditioners can't keep up with extreme heat, public places with air conditioning are a great resource. Public libraries often function informally as cooling centers for vulnerable members of their communities.""

Other solutions
Last year was the world's hottest year on record
, which broke
the record set in 2023
. Scientists say the most intense heat waves would not be possible without human-caused global warming. The primary cause of global warming is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.
Researchers say we already have scalable solutions
that can cut climate pollution, like wind and solar energy combined with large battery systems.
As for making our homes more equipped for a hotter world,
Nate Adams
, who helps make people's homes more comfortable and calls himself ""the House Whisperer,"" says to make sure that hot air outside isn't coming in when you don't want it to.
""The root cause of a lot of discomfort is a house that is leaky,"" Adams says. ""So one of the key things to look at is where you can seal up the house.""
Adams says to look at what he calls the ""bowels of the house"" for leaks, such as the attic and the basement.
Another solution, says
Daniel Barber
, professor of architectural theory at  Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, is to
put shades on the outside of the house
so heat doesn't come in with sunlight."

NEW YORK — An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.
The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.

A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.
""Like an air fryer, it's going to be hot,"" Maue said. ""This is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.""
Weather
Welcome to summer: U.S. braces for first significant heat wave of the new season
A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.
Where the heat will be worst
Nearly three-quarters of the country's population — 245 million people — will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.

Those triple-digit air temperatures — with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity — are possible in places where it's unusual. New York hasn't seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn't reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.
In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.
The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.

""You can't have kids getting heat stroke,"" he said. ""It's just too hot today.""
NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.
""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" he said.
Climate change is making Earth warmer
The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.
A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.
Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.
Sponsor Message
""The 'big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,"" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. ""The area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.""
Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 — a level Woods Placky said feels like ""you're in a swimming pool"" and ""the atmosphere is absorbing you.""
If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.
""It will be a shock to the system,"" she said."

Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on the planet, and some of them may be on the rise. At least in
Short Wave
listener Abigail Krich-Starr's neighborhood in eastern Massachusetts, they are.
""Just being in our backyard each year, in recent years, has become harder and harder,"" Krich-Starr says. ""Last year...we were just getting eaten alive out there.""
Abby isn't alone in her corner of the United States. In 2024, the
Washington Post
published a data analysis showing that in many parts of the US, mosquito season is multiple days, or even weeks, longer than it used to be. Experts say that's a good indicator that many mosquitoes may be thriving in areas they previously didn't.

Boston-area entomologist Doug Bidlack, who traps and surveils mosquitoes for the
East Middlesex Mosquito Control Project
, attributes that shift in certain mosquito populations to warmer, wetter, and more volatile local weather. That weather is linked to climate change.
Ecologists and other entomologists we spoke to say that this increased heat could also alter mosquito behavior, shift their natural habitat, and even change how pathogens incubate and spread inside their bodies.
So how do you protect yourself against the potentially growing masses?
We asked
Vivian Zeng
, the director of public health for Sudbury, Mass, close to where Krich-Starr lives. She had a few recommendations that apply to everyone:
Assess your risk by checking local mosquito surveillance efforts, like
this one
for the state of Massachusetts
Consider rescheduling outdoor events happening between dusk and dawn, which is peak biting time for multiple mosquito species
Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, weather-permitting, to limit exposed skin
Use an EPA-approved
DEET
repellent, and/or a
permethrin
spray for clothing and outdoor gear

Everyone knows the feeling: tossing and turning during a hot, sticky night when sleep feels impossible.
It's hard for anyone to sleep well when it's hot out. And the disruptions are growing, especially for those suffering from sleep apnea, as climate change pushes up temperatures day and night around the globe. A
new study
published in the journal
Nature Communications
found that the chance of having any kind of sleep apnea problem overnight goes up by almost 50% when it's 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, compared to when temperatures are in the 50s.
And the severe cases — when people stop breathing more than 30 times in a single hour — go up, too. ""You also increase the likelihood of having severe sleep apnea by 40%,"" says Bastien Lechat, a sleep expert at Flinders University in Australia and the lead author of the new study. ""It's a striking number.""
Sponsor Message
In sleep apnea, people's breathing stops and starts while they rest. The disorder can keep people's bodies from getting enough oxygen and disrupts sleep. An estimated
one billion people
worldwide deal with sleep apnea, though it's underdiagnosed, says Lechat. And the impacts of so much disrupted sleep are hefty. People's moods and ability to work are affected, and sleep loss contributes to many other health problems from heart attacks to strokes.
""We all know what it means to have a bad night of sleep,"" says Sara Mednick, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But science shows that the cumulative impacts of bad sleep, she says, trickle out beyond the person feeling tired. ""It's a whole global problem that we need to really think about,"" she says.
The study used about two years of sleep data from more than 125,000 people, in 41 different countries worldwide.The data tracked detected sleep disruptions with sensors placed under people's mattresses and tracked changes in sleep apnea incidents over time, and compared that sleep data with temperature where people lived. As temperatures climbed, people's sleep apnea got worse.
The risk of having a severe sleep apnea event when it was very hot out nearly doubled in many northern countries, like Europe and Russia. It went up by about 40% in countries like the U.S.
Sponsor Message
Lechat thinks the differences might stem from air conditioning access — one factor the study couldn't take into account. Fewer people in Europe use air conditioners than in the U.S. or Australia, leaving people exposed to the full impact of hotter temperatures day and night.
Climate change has pushed up global temperatures over the past few decades, and that extra heat is costing people sleep already, the study found. The U.K, for example, has warmed just over a degree Fahrenheit since 2000; the overall health cost from heat-worsened sleep apnea issues grew by more than 90% as time passed and temperatures climbed. As temperatures rise further, the impacts will also grow, Mednick says .
""As temperature gets higher, our sleep quality gets lower,"" she says. And that means ""we are just going to continue to lose sleep"" as climate change marches forward.
Other recent studies found that climate change is disrupting sleep for people without disorders like sleep apnea, too.
A study
using millions of Fitbit sleep records worldwide found that people fell asleep later, woke up earlier, and slept more poorly as temperatures went up — and that people didn't get better at dealing with the heat over time.
Another study
in China found that a 10-degree Celsius (18-degree Fahrenheit) jump in temperatures cut sleep time by about 10 minutes per night in China.
The message from those studies, and the new research, is unambiguous, says Nick Obradovich, a data scientist at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Oklahoma, who worked on several sleep-and-climate focused studies in the past but was not involved in the new study. ""As temperatures increase, people sleep less well across all the measures, across all the places that we've seen so far.""
To reclaim good sleep, Obradovich says, the first goal is stopping temperatures from rising more. But controlling your sleep environment likely helps too, by cooling it down with fans or air conditioning.

""My worry is for people who can't do that,"" Lechat says. For people in vast swaths of Earth without access to cooling, the future looks hotter and filled with more sleep disruptions."

about 40 days to roughly 70.

Millions will feel that firsthand over the coming days as a heat dome is expected to bring extreme heat and humidity for much of the U.S.
Those humid conditions
will make temperatures feel even hotter
and pose health risks to many.
Why is that?
In an interview with

that high levels of humidity simply make it feel hotter and challenge our body's mechanisms to regulate temperature.

Here's what she had to say about humidity and how to stay cool:
Why humidity poses risks during extreme heat
One of the human body's main ways of cooling down is sweating, and that sweat evaporating off the body. When it's humid, sometimes that isn't enough, Rao said.
""When the air is so full of moisture, that evaporation doesn't happen as efficiently or effectively, and so we aren't able to cool down as well,"" Rao said.
Rao said high humidity poses the strongest risk to seniors and young children, as well as pregnant women.
Life Kit
Planning to be outside on a hot and humid day? Take these precautions
But it can also come down to the exertion level of outdoor activity.
""So even a regular, healthy person who is out working very hard in the heat and humidity would be vulnerable,"" Rao said. ""And then, of course, people who are outdoors more for their job or people who are unhoused and then certain medications as well can make people more vulnerable.""
How can you stay safe during humid days?
While some people may initially feel that sitting by a fan alleviates the worst of the heat, Rao said that might not be enough on humid days. That's because the sweat on one's body doesn't have any place to evaporate off the skin because the air is already so full of water vapor.
Sponsor Message
""The fan kind of just cycles the same air around and it won't effectively cool people when it's very hot and humid,"" Rao added.
If you don't have air conditioning, Rao recommends getting some rest, taking regular breaks, closing blinds to cool down your home, hydrating and wearing loose-fitting clothes.

""There is no redundancy in the monitoring data sets we collect and maintain on species or ecosystems,"" she says. ""No one else collects these data on wildlife, fish, diseases — no one.""
When Baron and her colleagues proposed the reorganization that ultimately led to the EMA a few decades ago, they felt ""this would be a more appropriate way to tackle grand societal questions than what we'd had before,"" she says, including those associated with water, energy, minerals, and natural hazards.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment then stepped in to reduce pollution levels with support from the National Park Service. And more recently, she has detected climate change impacts on the watershed.
""So these long-term monitoring records allow you to continue to follow what's changing,"" Baron says. ""If you stop monitoring, you not only can't see if the changes are getting worse, you can't see if the actions actually made a difference.""

""So we work on problems that impact the nation as a whole. Someone needs to be looking at the bigger picture than what states and academics can often do.""
As for Droege, he and his team help states identify which bees are rare and in need of protection. He also spends a lot of time helping people across the country catch bees and then identify them. ""We're here to advise and help people do a better job to understand what kind of bees are around, how they're doing, what their status is."" Often, bees will be spotted in places they've never been seen before.

Droege speculates the government's decision to slash the EMA has to do with a drive to deregulate, since the group's research into different species helps inform management decisions that limit the use of land and natural resources.

In addition, the EMA helps protect Americans from natural disasters, including flooding, landslides, hurricanes and fire. ""So if you lose EMA, it really fundamentally changes our ability to understand and react to and respond appropriately to these challenges that seem to be expanding every day,"" says

""Cutting a few million dollars is going to have billions of dollars of impact, it's going to affect people's lives,"" he says. ""It's going to affect their health. I think it's shortsighted.""
John Organ

""This will have a cascading effect to the state fish and wildlife agencies who use the units as a research arm, the non-governmental organizations that rely on that science to do their work, as well as local communities because of the impact on jobs and hiring,"" he says.

The first significant heat wave of the summer is hitting much of the United States this week. From the Midwest to the East Coast, extreme heat and humidity levels will significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses, according to the
National Weather Service
.
So if you're planning to be outside, whether it's for fun or for work, take measures to stay cool and protect yourself against heat-related illness, says
Ashley Ward
, director of Duke University's Heat Policy Innovation Hub.

5 simple (and cheap) things to make your house use less energy
If there's a heat advisory in your area, you'll want to
avoid outdoor activities
. But even if there isn't one, take caution when outside on a hot day, she says. "" It's one of the big misconceptions about heat to think, 'I'm only in danger when there's a heat wave occurring.""
Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States, according to
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
, experts say its
risks are likely underestimated
.
It can cause heat exhaustion, ""your body's way of telling you to get out of the heat immediately,"" or heat stroke, a life-threatening illness
that can occur if heat exhaustion isn't treated, says
Dr. Renee Salas
, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected throughout the summer, according to NOAA. Heatwaves and longer, hotter summer seasons are intensifying because of
human-caused climate change
, according to the
World Health Organization
.
Here's how to plan for outings in hot weather.
Don't just rely on the air temperature. Check the heat index.
Before starting your lifeguard shift or going to that barbecue, take a moment to check the heat index. It includes humidity as well as the air temperature, giving you a more accurate read on how hot it will feel outside, Ward says.

Also take note of the cloud coverage, wind flow and time of day you plan to be outdoors. When it comes to heat-related illnesses, ""if it's a very humid day and there's no wind speed, then you are more at risk, even if the air temperature is lower,"" Ward says.
For example, a very humid 88-degree day with no wind could be more dangerous than a 94-degree day with low humidity.
If you can, plan outdoor activities earlier in the day, before the hottest time of day in your area. ""Three to 5 p.m. in the afternoon is one of the most dangerous times of day,"" says Ward.

Cheap and easy ways to stock your emergency go bag
Consider what you're wearing.
Whether you're headed to the pool or going for a walk, wear lightweight, breathable garments. Opt for cotton or linen fabrics, which have big pores in their woven threads that allow for air circulation, or moisture-wicking materials, which draw sweat away from your skin, helping it to evaporate more quickly, Ward says.
Choose loose-fitting silhouettes, Salas says. If your clothes are too tight, the sweat on your skin can't evaporate, which is key to keeping your body cool. ""I'm sure people don't love sweating profusely, but sweating is actually our friend when it comes to heat.""
Don't forget sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat to prevent sunburn, says
Alyssa Provencio
, a professor at the University of Central Oklahoma who researches emergency and disaster management.
Opt for shady, natural environments.
Your location can make a big difference in how hot it feels. Dark surfaces like asphalt tend to absorb more heat than natural environments. And because shaded areas have less solar exposure, they can feel much cooler, Ward says. ""You can reduce the temperature around you 10 degrees or more by just moving to an area that's shaded.""
So if you're a dog walker and it's a hot day, walk those pets down a tree-lined park or a wooded trail instead of the sidewalk. Or if you're headed to the pool, bring a sun umbrella or a pop-up tent to provide some coverage, Provencio says.
Sponsor Message
Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion.
If you're out with a group of friends on a hot day, keep yourself and others safe by looking out for signs of illness among each other. ""Somebody may notice something in you that you don't notice,"" Salas says.
Heat exhaustion is
your body's warning sign that you're starting to overheat, Salas says. Generally, symptoms include sweating more than
usual, weakness, dizziness, fainting, pale skin
,
nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
Pay special attention to seniors, children, people with certain pre-existing medical conditions, and people on commonly prescribed medications to help manage blood pressure and mental health conditions. They are at higher risk of heat-related illnesses, Salas says.
If you or someone you know is experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, Salas recommends going into an air-conditioned room. Provencio recommends public libraries because they're free and open to everyone.
If you're still experiencing symptoms of heat exhaustion after removing yourself from the heat, seek medical care.
Water is your friend.
On hot days, bring water with you wherever you go. Salas says drinking water can help your body produce more sweat.
Beware of drinking alcohol on hot days, she says. You may be tempted to crack open a cold beer on the beach, but it's a diuretic that can dehydrate you and impact your ability to sweat and cool yourself.

If you're feeling hot and need a quick way to cool down, you can also submerge yourself in a body of water. If that's not feasible, dunk your feet and arms in cold water, Ward says. It can ""lower your core body temperature.""
Lower your body temperature with cooling towels.
If you're feeling hot, put an ice pack, a wet towel or a cooling towel,
which stays extra cold when they get wet
, on the back of your neck, under your armpits and on your groin, Ward says.

""Some of the body's major blood vessels closer to the skin live there,"" Salas says. And when you put something cold on those areas, ""it can help cool the blood running through them.""
Don't forget to take breaks.
""If you're being active outside, whether that's working, exercising or
playing sports, as you work, your muscles are producing heat,"" Salas says. So take a moment to stop producing heat and cool down in the shade or an air-conditioned room.
On those breaks, remember to drink more water too, Provencio says.

The leader of the country's top disaster coordination office has resigned, the latest high-level official to resign from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as President Trump moves to eliminate the agency.
Jeremy Greenberg led the National Response Coordination Center at FEMA since 2020. He resigned last week, he confirmed to NPR.
The top FEMA position is currently held by an interim leader, David Richardson, who has
no prior emergency management experience
. After he was installed in May,
Reuters reported
more than a dozen top FEMA employees resigned.
Greenberg's resignation further hobbles the agency, as the U.S. enters its busiest season for extreme weather disasters including hurricanes, floods and wildfires. Climate change is causing more severe weather across the country.
Sponsor Message
The National Response Coordination Center acts like air traffic control for first responders after a hurricane, tornado, flood, wildfire, earthquake or other national emergency. It's a crucial role, because responding to deadly disasters requires equipment, employees and expertise from multiple federal agencies and from state and local governments.
Climate
Trump wants states to handle disasters. States aren't prepared
For example, when Hurricane Helene barreled ashore last year, millions of people across multiple states were under evacuation orders. Greenberg's team was
activated three days
before the storm made landfall, according to Congressional testimony by then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell.
The center
kept track
of where FEMA employees and equipment were prepositioned before the storm arrived, how other agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and Department of Transportation were responding, where emergency shelters were located and how many first responders had been deployed to help in each affected place.
Greenberg told NPR he will continue to work at FEMA for two more weeks, and referred all other questions to FEMA leaders.
The agency did not respond to questions from NPR about who would lead its disaster coordination office after Greenberg departs. In an email to NPR, a spokesperson for the agency acknowledged Greenberg's resignation and wrote, ""FEMA has the right leadership in place to continue to be laser focused on our mission and are fully prepared for Hurricane season.""

Two years ago, the Federal Communications Commission
unanimously voted
to require that
wireless emergency alerts
reach people in
13 languages and American Sign Language
. Those are the alerts people get during climate disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, as well as Amber Alerts. As of now, wireless emergency alerts only go out in Spanish and English. Yet, nearly
68 million Americans speak another language other than English at home
, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
But some Democratic Congress members and nonprofits say since the Trump administration came into office, the FCC has delayed sending what's called a report and order to the Federal Register. That starts a 30-month window for participating wireless providers, such as AT&T and Verizon, to update wireless emergency alerts in the 13 most common spoken languages in the U.S. (Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, Korean, Russian, Haitian Creole, German, Hindi, Portuguese, Italian and American Sign Language.)
Sponsor Message
California Congresswoman Nanette Barragán, a Democrat, says the FCC has already approved this change, which she notes
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr backed in 2023
.
""So as we go forward with this, I think there's a lot that we can do to improve this, particularly around accessibility and making sure the system continues to work for everyone, so this item has my support,"" Carr said right before the vote happened in April of that year.
Only one step remains: to publish the report and order in the Federal Register. That would require wireless providers such as AT&T and Verizon to install a template in each of the languages.
"" When an emergency alert comes in, people should be able to understand what it says and the instructions are being given on what to do,"" Barragán says. ""This is about saving lives, it's about safety.""
It's unclear why the FCC has delayed updating the wireless emergency alert system.
NPR reached out to FCC Chair Brendan Carr's office and the agency's Office of Media Relations for comment multiple times, but did not get a response.
But Barragán and nonprofits, like the AAPI Equity Alliance, point to one executive order signed by President Trump on his inauguration day called
""Regulatory Freeze Pending Review""
as the reason for the delay. The order prohibits executive departments and agencies from sending reports to the Office of the Federal Register until a designated Trump administration official approves the rule.
Sponsor Message
"" This is an independent agency,"" says Barragán, who represents South Los Angeles. ""There shouldn't even be a requirement that somebody in the Trump White House has to review and approve any kind of action by an independent agency like the FCC.""
NPR reached out multiple times to the White House for comment, but did not receive a response.
FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez — nominated to the body by President Joe Biden — says the commission has adopted other rules and orders that have been
published in the Federal Register
since Trump took office.
"" So it's not clear to me why there is a delay in getting this one published,"" Gomez says.
When NPR asked if Trump's Jan. 20 executive order is holding up the process, Gomez said it's possible. "" It's past time for the FCC to allow this process to move forward so that more people can receive the critical information they need in a language and format they understand,"" she says.
Congress established the
Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act
in 2006. That gave the FCC the ability to adopt technical standards, protocols and procedures so that mobile providers could send out emergency alerts during climate disasters and Amber Alerts.
The protocols allow federal, state and local governments to use wireless emergency alerts to send warnings to the public through their mobile devices through FEMA-approved software. Once that emergency alert is authenticated and validated, it goes through a distribution channel to wireless providers.
During the
wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year
, wireless providers sent out evacuation messages to subscribers as long as they did not opt out of receiving emergency alerts.
However, a
UCLA study found that over 12,000 Asian Americans
in the four evacuation zones didn't understand the evacuation alerts they were getting through their mobile providers.
Paul Ong is one of the study's authors and directs UCLA's Center for Neighborhood Knowledge. He says having multilingual wireless emergency alerts during the wildfires would have been extremely beneficial to the Asian community in L.A.
Sponsor Message
""Among Asian Americans, we find a huge diversity in languages,"" Ong says. ""Even among language groups such as Chinese, you have many, many different dialects.""
The Congressional Hispanic, Asian Pacific American and Black Caucuses called on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to publish the report and order to start updating the multilingual wireless emergency alerts in a letter sent on May 26.
""Failing to implement this rule means denying millions of Americans access to potentially life-saving emergency alerts — whether for wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, active shooters, or other disasters — in a language that they understand. That is unacceptable,"" the tri-caucuses wrote in the letter.
Hotter temperatures are already drying out vegetation in the west — making wildfires more likely.
Hurricane season
is already underway along the Atlantic coast. That's why AAPI's Equity Alliance's executive director Manjusha Kulkarni hopes the FCC moves forward with implementing its updated emergency alert system.
""The language that any individual speaks really shouldn't keep them from receiving necessary information to keep their families safe,"" Kulkarni says."

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to
stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
VIENNA — At the edge of a wide, grassy park in Vienna, there's a
modern building
with lots of windows and a sleek wood facade. For the past six years, Sebastian Schublach has lived here with his family in a light-filled four-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor.
Up on the roof, where Schublach can relax in the communal library with a view of the city and park, there are solar panels to reduce climate pollution. There's a rooftop garden full of rosemary — the greenery helps keep the building cool in summer. Thick, insulated walls reduce the need for heating and cooling — Schublach's apartment doesn't even need an air conditioner. ""It's not cold in winter times. It's not hot in summer times,"" Schublach says. ""It's very comfortable.""

In the United States, high-quality, climate-friendly apartments like this are mostly rare and unaffordable, says
Daniel Aldana Cohen
, professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley and co-director of the think tank the
Climate and Community Institute

About half of Vienna's 2 million residents
live in social housing. Average social housing rents are about $700 for a large one-bedroom apartment, says Gerald Kössl, researcher at the Austrian Federation of Limited-Profit Housing Associations. Schublach pays more for his four-bedroom — with utilities, it's around $1,700 per month. ""Which is not 'cheap, cheap,' but it's definitely affordable,"" he says.
Climate
This country is slowing climate action. Its capital city is stepping up
In the U.S., the number of households officially ""burdened by rent"" has hit another record high. As of 2023, more than 22 million renting households are spending more than 30% of their incomes on rent and utilities,
according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies
. Meanwhile, climate change-fueled wildfires, floods, heat waves and sea-level rise are
making it harder to find safe, affordable dwellings
. And the energy used to heat and cool the nation's housing stock contributes to climate pollution.
The lack of affordable housing and the growing threat of global warming used to be thought of as two distinct problems. Now that's changing, and politicians in U.S. cities like
Chicago
and Denver are looking to tackle the housing crisis while simultaneously combating climate change. They see Vienna's green social housing as a roadmap.

Using social housing as a lever for climate goals
Just like the United States, the federal government of Austria has recently been backtracking on climate action. But
Vienna is forging ahead
. This spring the Austrian capital passed a historic climate law, outlining a plan to get its climate pollution down to zero by 2040. Vienna's leaders see the city's vast social housing program as a critical tool.
Vienna has two main types of social housing: city-owned and city-subsidized. Vienna owns and operates about
220,000 apartment units
. Some date back to the period from 1919 to 1934 when, amid a postwar housing crisis, the newly elected left-wing Social Democratic Party built more than 60,000 brand-new, high-quality apartments for its citizens, says
Eve Blau
, architecture and urban history professor at Harvard. Today
the city also subsidizes about 200,000 apartment units
.
As Vienna makes an aggressive push to completely move away from climate-polluting natural gas by 2040, it's starting with much of this social housing, says
Jürgen Czernohorszky
, executive city councilor responsible for climate and environment.
City-owned buildings
are now switching from gas to massive electric heat pumps, and to geothermal, which involves probing into the ground to heat homes. Another
massive geothermal project
that drills even deeper into the earth to heat homes is also underway.
About half of Vienna's 2 million residents live in social housing. Here, at Biotope City, the social housing has solar panels. Vienna is using social housing to cut greenhouse gases and help adapt to climate change.

The city is also powering housing with solar energy.
As of a year and a half ago
, Vienna mandates
all new buildings
and building extensions to have rooftop solar. And Vienna's older apartment buildings are getting climate retrofits, says Veronika Iwanowski, spokesperson for Vienna's municipal housing company,
Wiener Wohnen
. That includes new insulation, doors and windows to prevent the city's wind from getting in the cracks.

The increase in energy efficiency and switching from gas to renewables doesn't just have climate benefits from cutting fossil fuel use. It also means housing residents are paying less on electric bills, Czernohorszky says. ""The sun,"" he says, ""doesn't send an energy bill.""

To spur climate-friendly designs, Vienna makes competitions
Schublach's light-filled building, Gleis 21, is a type of housing subsidized by the city. And it's an example, researchers say, of how Vienna uses subsidized housing to drive innovative climate design.
With city-subsidized housing, housing developers can compete to get land and low-interest loans from the city. Officials say those competitions are a critical lever for climate action. ""As we can control the contents of the competitions, we try to make them fit to the main goals of the city,"" says Kurt Hofstetter, city planner for Vienna, ""which is of course also ecological.""

When developers compete, they submit proposals to a panel of expert judges who award them points for the features the buildings will have. When the competitions began in the 1990s, judges awarded points for things like beautiful architecture and keeping costs low. But in the late 2000s, the city also started to prioritize climate-friendly designs, says Wolfgang Förster, director of Vienna-based housing consultancy
PUSH Consulting
, and a former head of housing research for the city. Now the housing judges give out points for things like increased energy efficiency, green roofs and sustainable building materials.
The land that's now Schublach's apartment had been an old rail yard. Around a decade ago when Vienna was turning the land into housing, the competition was fierce. A group of about 20 friends and acquaintances wanted to make an apartment together, and they had their eyes on a plot at the edge of the park. The group chose an architect,
Markus Zilker, who along with his team
made a design full of climate-friendly features, including lots of insulation and sustainable building materials. The architects also completed an analysis of the full life cycle of the greenhouse gas emissions of the building materials. Zilker remains convinced that the climate elements of Gleis 21's proposal were what helped them beat the competition.

Climate-friendly designs are increasingly rewarded with points in competitions, leading to more and more green social housing, Zilker says. Now the climate innovations in subsidized housing are inspiring the private market as well, Hofstetter says. ""The subsidized housing has such high quality,"" Hofstetter says, ""because we always are pushing it to the limits.""
Over 40% of Vienna's housing stock is ""social housing"" — that is, housing owned or subsidized by the city. ""Because the financing is smart,"" says Daniel Aldana Cohen at UC Berkeley, "" you get the result. Beautiful, affordable housing that fights climate change.""

Social housing fits into the city's broader climate adaptation plan

Europe is warming up twice as fast as the global average
, according to Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization.
Vienna isn't just working to reduce climate pollution, it's also building new infrastructure to help adapt to global warming. Hofstetter says social housing is intricately tied into these new plans.

As the U.S. federal government pulls back, local governments take the lead
In the U.S. today, much of the public housing and subsidized affordable housing has a connection to the federal government. Some of it was funded or built by the federal government or with some combination of federal tax credits and money from other sources.
Under the Biden administration, the U.S. federal government tried to tackle climate pollution through federally assisted housing with a $1 billion program to make older housing more
energy efficient and climate resilient
. Now that President Trump has returned to office his administration
has taken steps to eliminate the program
, although it's still
unclear what will happen to it
. Many other federally funded housing assistance programs
are also on the chopping block
.
Last September Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
introduced the Homes Act
, which would support the construction of climate-friendly affordable housing. Smith tells NPR she was inspired to learn more about social housing after visiting Vienna, and from her work on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. But the legislation remains stalled in Congress.
While federal efforts for green social housing have slowed, there's momentum on the local level, says
Ruthy Gourevitch
, housing and communities director at the Climate and Community Institute, which
just released a new report on lessons from Viennese green social housing for the U.S.

Gourevitch says that, like Vienna, America's green social housing doesn't have to rely on federal funding. Some money to finance Vienna's social housing comes from a tax on people's salaries — the employee pays part and the employer pays part, Kössl says. Most of the city's funding is provided in the form of
low-interest loans
, he adds. And in city-subsidized housing, also called ""limited profit"" housing, developers must invest profits back into maintaining housing or building more housing.

U.S. cities are also finding local funds to build green housing. Chicago is using $135 million of a
larger city bond
as a ""seed fund"" for climate-friendly affordable housing. A new ""
Green Social Housing
"" ordinance passed this spring creates a nonprofit that will administer the funds and have an ownership stake in the development of new apartment buildings. The plan is for 30% of the apartments to be affordable and for the buildings to reduce energy use and climate pollution.
This spring, Chicago's City Council approved Mayor Brandon Johnson's ""Green Social Housing"" ordinance. It will spur the development of new affordable housing that reduces climate pollution.

In Vienna, much of the long-term popularity of social housing comes down to the fact that residents of different social classes have access to the same high quality amenities, Cohen at UC Berkeley says.
This is on full view in
Biotope City
, a development in Vienna's south where the majority of the apartments are city-subsidized. For resident

Her apartment balcony is nestled in the trees of the nearby park. "" It feels like living in a jungle because we hear all the voices from birds in our flat,"" Iscen says. ""It's wonderful.""
Most of Vienna's new social housing is city-subsidized, like Iscen's apartment building.  While rents vary, city-subsidized rents tend to be higher than in city-built housing and sometimes require a down payment. It ""tends to be  more oriented toward people in the middle income kind of section of society, rather than those with lowest incomes,"" Cohen at UC Berkeley says.
Vienna's system works, Cohen says, because lower-income residents can still find homes in city-built housing, ""which is a bit more of a safety net.""
Ultimately, Cohen says a key lesson from Vienna for the U.S. is the need for balance. ""You don't want to just pull one part of the model,"" he says. ""You wanna make sure that you are providing really good quality housing from the very lowest incomes all the way up.""

Making housing for all social classes is a goal of Chicago's new climate-friendly housing, according to Yoon at Chicago's mayor's office. ""This mixed-income model of social housing is absolutely integral to the success,"" Yoon says.
""If people of all walks of life are benefiting from this it is gonna be much harder to unwind, and much easier to defend politically.""
Yoon says in some communities there is some stigma against public housing, though she says that has shifted. She mostly hears from people who just want more housing options. ""We have a major housing crisis in the city — as do most places,"" she says. ""If anything, people just want more affordable housing.""

A new American dream
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
Here's how climate change is affecting your home insurance
For a long time, a big part of the American dream has been owning a single-family home in the suburbs. But those houses are increasingly threatened by wildfire, floods and heat. It's harder to get home insurance. For many Americans, the lack of safe, affordable housing is pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach.
Schublach has now lived in Vienna for 22 years, but he grew up in the Austrian countryside. He says in the countryside there's also a dream of a single-family home. ""I  think it's very similar to the American dream,"" he says. ""And the downside is that this dream for most people has become unaffordable.""
""So yes, this dream still exists. Some say it has become kind of a nightmare,"" Schublach says with a laugh. ""It's really a dream which cannot be fulfilled by many.""
But Schublach has found a new dream. In his climate-friendly social housing he's found a sense of community. The oldest inhabitant in his building is almost 80 and the youngest is less than 1 month old. He says they're all there for each other.
""If somebody needs a banana at 8 p.m. because the kid would not eat anything else, then you get a banana within one minute,"" Schublach says.

And the next time there's a storm or a heat wave in Vienna — because there will be a next time — Schublach says he'll be there for his neighbors, and they'll be there for him.
Schublach says people in the U.S. may look at Vienna's climate-friendly affordable housing and feel daunted, thinking the U.S. is too far behind. But he's optimistic.
""If it can be done in a city like Vienna with 2 million inhabitants, I see no reason why this cannot be done in any major or smaller U.S. city,"" Schublach says. ""This is something we can shape. It's not given, it's something we shape.""

Today, neighborhood children play on a soccer field carved deep into the ground. The park itself is enclosed by a 3-foot-high concrete wall with gates that automatically emerge from the ground, sealing the park so that it can hold floodwater.
Storing rainwater on the surface makes more sense than expanding the sewer system, says Jan Rasmussen, director of climate adaptation for the city of Copenhagen.
""You can't expand a pipe as easily as this area can be expanded,"" he says. ""[It's] also much cheaper if we can use areas like this to store rainwater.""
Rasmussen says Copenhagen has transformed 20 green areas like Enghaveparken into what the city nicknames ""sponge parks."" When full, he says, Enghaveparken can hold 25,000 cubic meters of water. When it's not raining, a 2,000-cubic-meter storage tank underneath a rose garden in the park holds rainwater collected from the neighborhood's storm drains, used to irrigate the park's lawns, trees and flowers.

stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
BOULDER, Colo. — Proponents of a growing movement in the construction industry are asking: Why tear down old buildings with wrecking balls when those materials can be mined for reusable materials?
The practice, called deconstruction, creates a circular economy of reuse for building materials. It keeps waste out of landfills and shrinks the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure. It's the kind of idea that sounds like an obvious win-win. But as the built environment rapidly changes over from one generation to the next, communities may not yet have the infrastructure — the sorting facilities and reuse stores — to keep up with new demand.
Sponsor Message
Deconstruction and reuse industries have taken flight in the past five to 10 years in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where much of the original aging housing stock is now being replaced to suit the tastes of a much wealthier 21st-century population. As old homes come down to make way for new ones, specialist contractors like Anna Perks are moving in to handle the materials left behind.
""Our team is systematically unbuilding the structure,"" said Perks, co-owner of Perks Deconstruction, a contracting company that disassembles buildings for parts. She was hired to make a snug three-bedroom, two-bath home near the top of a green, hilly street in Boulder disappear.

Her crew worked quickly. After the first day on-site, the roof of the house disappeared. The siding, too. A crew wielding hammers and crowbars pried pieces of wood sheathing off the studs and carefully sorted materials. Others clawed nails out of two-by-sixes in the backyard.
""We've got a pretty good pile of lumber,"" she said. ""That's all ceiling joists and floor joists. There's a lot of good reusable lumber in there.""
The workers were trained to work precisely and with patience to keep the lumber as intact as possible as they removed it from the house.

""Typically, what happens is a bulldozer will come in, smash it all — it'll all get trashed,"" Perks said. ""But deconstruction, we try to salvage and recycle as much as possible.""

The carbon emissions embodied in buildings
The idea is to limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for
nearly 40%
of global greenhouse gas emissions.
About half
of that comes from the
embodied carbon
of construction materials, according to Michelle Lambert, the policy and engagement manager at the nonprofit Carbon Leadership Forum.
""Embodied carbon is the greenhouse gas emissions that are generated by the manufacturing, the transportation, the installation, all the way through to the disposal of construction materials that are used in buildings or in roads and other infrastructure projects,"" Lambert said.
For a long time, experts have focused on the
climate impact
of building operations — the energy used to heat, cool and electrify spaces.
""But in the last five, 10 years, we've really started to understand that the materials and the processes that have created those materials are a really significant piece of the whole carbon footprint of buildings as well,"" she said.

The big promise of deconstruction is in creating a
circular economy
for building materials: harvesting lumber, say, from an old house, rather than a forest.
""Making use of the materials that we have already manufactured is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce embodied carbon,"" Lambert said. ""Eliminating all of those emissions that would've been required to create new materials.""
The challenges of deconstruction
Chris Fellows, president of Colorado-based development company Resolute Strategies, hired Perks Deconstruction to dismantle a few crumbling farm buildings on a former homestead he's now building out as a mixed-use residential neighborhood in Aurora. In his brief for the project, he included reusing as many of the original materials as possible on-site.
Sponsor Message
Bricks from the farmhouse and siding from the barn have been set aside in containers. They'll be incorporated into a new community center for the neighborhood.
""This was a place where there's cool history and culture in the pioneers and the settlers that came out and did
dryland farming
,"" Fellows said. ""We're trying to honor that part of that culture and history of Colorado.""
Fellows said he and his partners also liked deconstruction as a way to cut the carbon footprint of the project.
""We wanted to be good stewards of the land in terms of the climate and the environment,"" he said. ""So, to the extent that we could reuse and recycle any materials, we wanted to do that, so we don't have to consume as much new material, nor do we have to take as much stuff to a landfill.""
Just because the interest is there doesn't mean the execution is easy. A successful deconstruction program requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials, not to mention local end markets — people who want to buy and use those materials. Boulder, for instance, has a robust
deconstruction ecosystem
that includes expert contractors and recycling facilities for concrete, masonry and lumber, not to mention several building-materials reuse stores and donation centers.

But a lot of places don't have those resources.
""We have to have a place to take all this material,"" Perks said. ""It gets really hard for contractors when there's nowhere to take the material.""
The extra cost of deconstruction can also make it a hard sell. Homeowners and developers may be motivated by environmental reasons, but the economic incentives aren't there.
Fellows estimates that deconstruction increased project costs 35% to 40% and added at least a year to the schedule.
""Because we had to stage things carefully and do them in a certain sequence,"" he said. ""And we had to find the right people.""
Sponsor Message
Even so, Fellows said he's glad they went for it and even thinks he'll see an eventual return on the investment when eco-conscious homebuyers learn about the process.
""We'll have to check back in three to five years. We'll see if we think that's happening,"" he said. ""But I think it was still the right thing to do.""
On the books
A
handful
of local governments, from
Palo Alto, Calif.
, to
Fort Myers, Fla.
, and counting, now either require some percentage of demolition waste be salvaged, reused or recycled, or incentivize those practices. Portland, where
an ordinance
has been on the books since 2016, was among the earliest deconstruction pioneers.
In Boulder, more than 140 million pounds of materials have been kept out of landfills since a
deconstruction ordinance
was adopted in 2020, according to the city of Boulder's circular economy policy adviser, Emily Freeman.
Old wiring and pipe fittings are piled in the corner of a basement at a home in Boulder, where Perks Deconstruction is taking down the home and salvaging as much of its material as possible.

""All residential and commercial buildings are required to be deconstructed,"" Freeman said. ""The ordinance requirements are that 75% or more of those building materials are diverted from landfill.""
So far, the city has overshot that goal. Over the last five years, Freeman said, more than 83% of the construction waste generated in Boulder has been kept out of landfills.
As the movement matures, Perks said, the next frontier in deconstruction would be to
plan for disassembly
before a building ever got built.
""Can you either incorporate reclaimed materials into the new design, or when you're designing, can you think about what's this going to be like to take it down?"" she said. ""And when it gets taken down, can it be reused?""
Perks says the future of climate-conscious construction will be knowing exactly how you'll take a building apart before you even put it together.

about the site.
A staff of 10 people wrote content and created maps, charts and explanatory graphics for climate.gov. Those employees have now been terminated, according to Rebecca Lindsey, the former program manager for the website. NOAA did not respond to questions from NPR about changes to the site.

Lindsey had worked on

for 13 years, and had recently changed roles before she was laid off in February as part of a government-wide purge of what the government calls probationary employees, generally people who were new to their specific jobs.

All of those laid off were experienced science communication and data visualization experts who cannot be easily replaced with other NOAA employees, according to the official.
Until recently, the website published multiple items each week that were tailored to what was happening in the U.S. For example, in the last month, the site published up-to-date information about

You might be wondering what you can do to prepare your home for potential floodwaters. We can learn a lot from recent hurricane flood victims, like Papola, who are rebuilding with flooding and climate change in mind.
Here's how to harden your home or business from flooding.
Stay aware of future risks
Some people, like Papola, who had 4 feet of storm surge push onto his house, had to face the facts of human-caused climate change head-on: Flooding from hurricanes is becoming more intense, and it's not just a coastal issue.
Increased precipitation is leading to freshwater flooding, whether it's old stormwater infrastructure backing up, to rivers and lakes cresting, to accumulated rainfall.

Cheap and easy ways to stock your emergency go bag
Researchers at NASA say the number of people living in flood-prone areas globally has
increased by up to 24% since 2000
— that's 10 times greater than previous models predicted and is a direct result of climate-fueled storms.
Now, federal forecasters predict this year's Atlantic hurricane season will be above normal. Between June and November, there could be 13 to 19 named storms — three to five of which could be major.
Building materials matter
Some of the headache during storm cleanup includes soaked flooring, drywall and baseboards that you have to cut out and drag out of the house. If you want to stay in a place that can flood again, you can opt out of carpeting and wood floors.
Sponsor Message
Many residents are instead installing tile floors because the floodwaters don't penetrate the grout in which they're laid. So, you only have to worry about cleaning the floors after flooding. But a warning for some along the coast: It could be a messier cleanup if mud is involved.
Life Kit
Is Your Home At Risk From Climate Change? Here's How To Know
Let's talk about drywall. It absorbs floodwaters like a sponge and can fester dangerous mold if not removed. You can use cement board instead, which can dry off. As for those wooden baseboards, swap them out for PVC ones to prevent rotting upon contact with water.
Elevate
Raising your home is an expensive endeavor, starting at around $200,000. But for some rebuilding in particular flood zones, it's mandatory. FEMA requires that homes in flood zones be elevated at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation. Across Florida, concrete pilings to lift homes are going up 15 to 20 feet in neighborhoods that have experienced storm surge.
Programs may exist to help fund such an undertaking.
Elevate Florida
, for example, helped homeowners access federal grants from February to April of this year to pay for 75% of elevation costs.
And it's not just your home to consider elevating. Moving electrical outlets up higher on the wall prevents rising floodwaters from shorting out the entire electrical system or causing a fire.
Flood insurance
OK, so if you know your house has a flooding problem, you should consider flood insurance.
Flood insurance isn't just for homeowners. If you rent in a low-lying area, whether you're on the coast or inland, renters insurance is likely
not
going to cover your flooding losses. It's up to you, not your landlord, to get that added protection for your belongings inside a potentially risky structure you're leasing.
Flood insurance can be costly. But at this point, flooding is going to be expensive whether you prepare for it or not.
Sponsor Message
Papola says the reconstruction of his home after Helene is estimated at $145,000. He doesn't have to pay that himself because he has flood insurance. But that doesn't include the potential cost of elevating his home.
""The water is not a game for the middle class or the lower-middle class unless you're going to be able to insure properly and make sure that you have the ability to mitigate whatever type of loss comes with the storms,"" Papola says.
Consider the costs
It's important to recognize that all of these adaptations are, of course, pricier than rebuilding with the same materials you used before.
For instance, the cost of changing drywall to cement board (Durock is one brand) can be more than double. The same is true for replacing carpet with tile, not including the installation fees.
As for raising electrical outlets, Papola estimates the cost of all his electrical rewiring after the flood to be between $4,000 and $5,000.

The Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants.
The proposal is part of the Environmental Protection Agency's plan, under the Trump administration, to
roll back more than two dozen rules and policies
. The proposal is likely to face legal challenges, but if it is finalized in its current form, that would eliminate limits on the
second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S.
, behind transportation.
The EPA argues pollution from U.S. power plants are a small part of global emissions and they're declining. The agency also claims that eliminating climate pollution from power plants would have little effect on people's health.

The
proposed rule
reads, ""The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.""
In announcing the proposal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued that the Trump administration aims to protect the environment while boosting the economy.
""Rest assured President Trump is the biggest supporter of clean, beautiful coal,"" Zeldin said from a wood-paneled room at the agency. ""EPA is helping pave the way for American energy dominance because energy development underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security.""
The EPA announcement brought swift criticism from environmental groups.
""These regressive proposals are bad for public health and bad for climate, all to prop up some of the highest polluting power plants in the nation,"" Shaun Goho, legal director at Clean Air Task Force wrote in a statement.
This proposal would eliminate rules the
EPA finalized during the Biden administration
that required existing coal and new natural gas-fired power plants to significantly reduce their carbon dioxide pollution, starting in the 2030s. Carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of global warming.
The EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a
danger to public health and welfare in 2009
. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration also wants to eliminate that
2009 endangerment finding
, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

toward an even deeper embrace of fossil fuels
.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said to cheers from supporters at his January inauguration speech. He has started the yearlong process to
withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement
, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming. Trump declared a
national energy emergency
and placed a
moratorium on new wind energy projects
on federal land and in federal waters.
Now, the Trump administration argues U.S. power plants are responsible for only about 3% of the global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health.

But the U.S. coal industry opposed the limits on power plant climate pollution from the start. The industry has pushed back against decades of declining demand. In 1990 52% of the country's electricity was generated by burning coal and by
2023 that was down to 15%
.
""We applaud the Trump administration's work to counter the Biden administration's direct assault on coal power,"" Rich Nolan, National Mining Association president and CEO, wrote in a statement.
The industry has argued that coal-fired power is needed to meet increasing electricity demand, including for the expansion of data centers for the growing artificial intelligence (AI) industry.
West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, welcomed the proposal, calling it ""a major victory for West Virginia, our energy producers, and every American who depends on reliable, affordable electricity.""

As that coal-producing state's former attorney general, Morrisey led the effort to overturn climate pollution regulations on power plants over the past decade.
In April
Trump signed executive orders
to boost the struggling coal industry and power data centers by allowing older coal plants to keep operating, exempting them from federal pollution limits for two years and increasing coal mining on public lands. During his first term Trump
tried, and failed, to save individual coal plants
as operators
switched to more profitable gas-fired power plants
.
""The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that's poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,"" Manish Bapna, president and CEO of Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a statement.
The Biden administration's power plant rules aimed to get the country closer to the primary goal in the Paris climate accord — to zero out greenhouse gas pollution by 2050 in order to rein in worsening catastrophes driven by climate change, such as more intense heatwaves, floods and fires. The proposed Trump rules would move the U.S. further away from that goal.
The EPA also proposed to weaken a Biden-era rule that required power plants to limit other pollutants, such as mercury — a
neurotoxin that limits brain and nervous system development
, especially in infants and children. Coal power plants are the country's
largest source
of mercury pollution.
""As Trump and his EPA continue to shovel dirty old coal down our throats, they're now adding more toxic heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic to the mix,"" Ryan Maher, environmental health attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity wrote in an emailed statement. ""If these reckless rollbacks are allowed to stand they'll only fan the flames of extreme heat and wildfires, and they'll trigger more child deaths, more cancers, more lung diseases and more heart attacks.""

Power plant pollution rules delayed for more than a decade
The legal basis for rules to limit climate pollution from power plants started with the Supreme Court's 2007
Massachusetts v. EPA
decision. It concluded that the EPA is required to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. That led to
the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding
that designated greenhouse gas pollution as a threat to human health.
In 2014 the Obama administration
proposed
a ""Clean Power Plan"" aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32%, from 2005 levels, by 2030. That plan faced legal challenges and never went into effect. Still the country
met that goal
well before 2030, as coal-fired power plants were replaced by natural gas plants that emit less climate pollution and renewable energy.
In 2019 Trump
replaced
the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with his Affordable Clean Energy rule, which allowed plants to emit more climate pollution.
Then Biden came into office in 2021 with the most ambitious plan to address climate change of any major party candidate in U.S. history. The administration set a goal of eliminating climate pollution from the power sector by 2035.
Scientists say
that's what's needed to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst effects of climate change. So far, the world's continued fossil fuel use puts it on track to exceed 1.5 Celsius —
2024 was the hottest year ever recorded
.
Climate
Electric grills are a climate-friendly option to fossil fuel grills
In 2022, the
Supreme Court weighed in again and restricted
the EPA's options for regulating power plant emissions. Justices said that without a specific law, the agency cannot force the entire power generation industry to move away from fossil fuels toward less-polluting energy sources.
So, instead, the EPA created regulations governing individual power plants. The agency and environmental groups believed that would allow the rules to survive scrutiny from a court dominated by conservative justices.
Instead, the Trump administration is eliminating the regulation altogether. Once the rule is finalized — possibly at the end of this year — it's likely that will also be challenged in court."

for building and living on a hotter planet.
SEATTLE — Across the U.S., cities are struggling to balance the need for more housing with the need to preserve and grow trees that help address the impacts of climate change.
Trees provide cooling shade that can save lives. They absorb carbon pollution from the air and reduce stormwater runoff and the risk of flooding. Yet many builders perceive them as an obstacle to quickly and efficiently putting up housing.
Sponsor Message
This tension between development and tree preservation is at a tipping point in Seattle, where a
new state law
is requiring more housing density but not more trees.
One solution is to find ways to build density
with
trees. The Bryant Heights development in northeast Seattle is an example of this. It's an extra-large city block that features a mix of modern apartments, town houses, single-family homes and retail. Architects Ray and Mary Johnston worked with the developer to place 86 housing units where once there were four. They also saved trees.
Architects Mary and Ray Johnston saved more than 30 trees in the Bryant Heights development they worked on.

""The first question is never, how can we get rid of that tree,"" explains Mary Johnston, ""but how can we save that tree and build something unique around it."" She points to a row of town homes nestled into two groves of mature trees that were in place before construction began in 2017. Some grow mere feet from the new buildings.
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
Faced with rising temps, Las Vegas is embracing a simple climate solution: More trees
The Johnstons preserved more than 30 trees at Bryant Heights, from Douglas firs and cedars to oak trees and Japanese maples.
One of Ray Johnston's favorites is a deodar cedar that's more than 100 feet tall. The tree stands at the center of a group of apartment buildings. ""It probably has a canopy that is close to over 40 feet in diameter,"" he notes.
This cedar cools the nearby buildings with the shade from its canopy. It filters carbon emissions and other pollution from the air and serves as a gathering point for residents. ""So it's like another resident, really — it's like their neighbor,"" Mary Johnston says.

Preserving this tree required some extra negotiations with the city, according to the Johnstons. They had to prove their new construction would not harm it. They had to agree to use concrete that is porous for the walkways beneath the tree to allow water to seep down to the tree's roots.
The developer could have easily decided to take this tree out, along with another one nearby, to fit another row of town houses down the middle of the block. ""But it never came to that because the developer was enlightened that way,"" Ray Johnston says.

Housing pushes trees out
Seattle, like many cities, is in the throes of a housing crunch, with pressure to add thousands of new homes every year and increase density. Single-family zoning is no longer allowed; instead, a minimum of four units per lot must now be allowed in all urban neighborhoods.
The City Council recently
updated its tree protection ordinance
, a law it
first passed in 2001
, to keep trees on private property from being cut down during development.
""Its baseline is protection of trees,"" says
Megan Neuman, a land use policy and technical teams manager with Seattle's Department of Construction and Inspections. She says the new tree code includes ""limited instances"" where tree removal is allowed.
""That's really to try to help find that balance between housing and trees and growing our canopy,"" Neuman says. Despite the city's efforts to preserve and grow the urban canopy, the
most recent assessment
showed it shrank by a total of about half a percent from 2016 to 2021. That's equivalent to 255 acres — an area roughly the size of the city's
popular Green Lake
, or more than 192 regulation-size American football fields. Neighborhood residential zones and parks and natural areas saw the biggest losses, at 1.2% and 5.1% respectively.
Seattle says it's working on multiple fronts to reverse that trend. The city's Office of Sustainability and Environment says the city is planting more trees in parks, natural areas and public rights of way. A
new requirement means
the city also has to care for those trees with watering and mulching for the first five years after planting, to ensure they survive Seattle's increasingly hot and dry summers.
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
How homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses against disasters
The city also says the 2023 update to its tree protection ordinance
increases tree replacement requirements
when trees are removed for development. It extends
protection to more trees
and requires, in most cases, that for every tree removed, three must be planted. The goal is to reach canopy coverage of
30% by 2037
.
Developers generally support Seattle's latest tree protection ordinance because they say it's more predictable and flexible than previous versions of the law. Many of them helped shape the new policies as they face pressure to add about 120,000 homes over the next 20 years, based on growth management planning required by the state.

Cameron Willett, Seattle-based director of city homes at Intracorp, a Canadian real estate developer, sees the current code as a ""common sense approach"" that allows housing and trees to coexist. It allows builders to cut down more trees as needed, he says, but it also requires more replanting and allows them to build around trees when they can. ""I definitely have projects I've done this year where I've taken out a tree that, under the old code, I would not have been able to do,"" Willett says. ""But I've also had to replant both on- and off-site.""
Willett recalls one development this year where he preserved a mature tree, which required proving that the site could be developed without damaging that tree. That also meant ""additional administrative complexity and costs,"" he explains.
Still, Willett says it's worth it when it works.
""Trees make better communities,"" he says. ""We all want to save the trees, but we also need to be able to get to our max density.""
But Tree Action Seattle and other tree-protection groups frequently highlight new developments where they say too many trees are being taken out to make way for housing. This tension comes after a devastating heat dome hovered over the Pacific Northwest in the summer of 2021. ""We saw hundreds of people die from that, hundreds of people who otherwise wouldn't have died if the temperatures hadn't gotten so high,"" says
Joshua Morris, conservation director with the nonprofit Birds Connect Seattle. He served six years as a volunteer adviser and co-chair of the city's Urban Forestry Commission, which provides expertise on policies for conservation and management of trees and vegetation in Seattle.

Making space for trees
Seattle's South Park neighborhood is one of those hotter neighborhoods. Residents have roughly 12% to 15% tree canopy coverage there — about half as much as the citywide average. Studies show
life expectancy rates here are 13 years shorter
than in leafier parts of the city. That's in large part due to air pollution and contaminants from a nearby Superfund site.
In a cleared lot in South Park, 22 new units are going in where once four single-family homes stood. Three big evergreens and several smaller trees are expected to be cut down, says Morris. But with some ""slight rearrangements to the configuration of buildings that are being proposed,"" Morris surmises, ""an architect who has done an analysis of this site reckons that all of the trees that would be slated for removal could be retained. And more trees could be added.""
Tree removals are allowed under Seattle's updated tree code. But removing larger trees now requires developers to plant replacements on-site or pay into a fund that the city plans to use to help reforest neighborhoods like South Park.
In Seattle's South Park neighborhood, residents have about half as much tree canopy as the citywide average. Four single-family homes once stood on this lot, where 22 new units will soon be built. Plans filed with the city show three large evergreens and several smaller trees that are still standing on the lot are slated for removal.

Groups such as
Tree Action Seattle
point out that these new trees will take many years to mature — sacrificing years of carbon mitigation work when compared with existing mature trees — at a critical time for curbing planet-warming emissions.
Morris says the trees that will likely be cut down for this development might not seem like a big number.
""This really is death by a million cuts.""
He says trees have been cut down all over the city for years — thousands per year.
""At that scale, the cooling effect of the trees is diminished,"" says Morris, ""and the increased risk of death from excessive heat is heightened.""
Building codes aren't keeping up with climate change
Tree loss is not limited to Seattle. It's happening in
dozens of cities
across the country, from Portland, Ore., to Charleston, W.Va., and Nashville, Tenn., says Portland State University geography professor Vivek Shandas. ""If we don't take swift and very direct action with conservation of trees, of existing canopy, we're going to see the entire canopy shrink,"" Shandas says.
Sponsor Message
He says current municipal codes don't adequately address the implications of climate change. The Pacific Northwest, Shandas says, should be preparing for increasingly hot summers and more intense rain in winter. Trees are needed to provide shade and absorb runoff.
""So that development going in — if it's lot edge to lot edge — we're going to see an amplification of urban heat,"" Shandas says. ""We're going to see a greater amount of flooding in those neighborhoods.""
Climate change is intensifying hurricanes and raising sea levels while also playing a role in wildfires. Such extreme conditions are outpacing building codes, explains Shandas, and he fears this will happen in the Northwest too.
Shandas says how developers respond to the building codes that Seattle adopts over the next 20 to 50 years will determine the extent to which trees will help people here adapt to the warming climate.
That matters in Seattle, where the nights aren't cooling off nearly as much as they used to and where average daytime highs are getting hotter every year.
The Bryant Heights development is a modern mix of apartments, town houses, single-family homes and retail. Architects Ray and Mary Johnston worked with the developer to place 86 housing units where there were initially four.

A solution in the design
Architects Ray and Mary Johnston see part of the solution at another Seattle development they designed around an existing 40-year-old Scotch pine.
The Boulders development, near Seattle's Green Lake Park, transformed a single-family lot into a complex with nine town homes. The developer added mature trees he salvaged from other developments — transplanting them strategically to add texture and cooling to the landscaping.
Mary Johnston says building with trees in mind could also help people's pocketbooks. Boulders, she says, is an example. ""Since these units have air conditioning, those costs are going to be lower because you have this kind of cooler environment,"" she says. Ray Johnston says places like this shady urban oasis should be incentivized in city codes, especially as climate change continues.
""Would you rather be living here with the shade we have ... or would you rather be in a much more urban, treeless, shadeless environment, where you can't hang out outside?"" he asks.

The roof on Ron Watson's house in Spanish Fort, Ala., looks about the same as the roofs you'd see across the state, but every year, it's saving him money on his insurance.
Thanks to special nails designed to stay in place during high winds and other hidden construction details, it's less likely to be damaged or ripped off in the hurricane-force winds Alabama often faces. As a result, Watson's insurance company offered him a discount on his premium, part of a program pioneered by Alabama to encourage homeowners to make their houses more resistant to disasters.

""That's a big incentive,"" Watson says. ""Homeowners insurance now has been through the roof because of the storms we've had through here.""
States around the country are developing similar insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, as a way of addressing an ever-growing insurance crisis. Premiums are getting more expensive as the cost of extreme weather disasters surges. At the same time, many homeowners haven't taken steps to protect their houses from those disasters, like using stronger building materials that can better withstand storms and wildfires.

Climate change is driving more flood risk. This solution is helping towns adapt
More than 50,000 roofs in Alabama have now been strengthened, according to state officials, meeting what's known as the
FORTIFIED Roof standard
. Homeowners can qualify for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance, or even more, if other parts of the house are strengthened.
An insurance discount program is far newer in California, where tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed by wildfires in recent years, and insurance costs are soaring. After January's Los Angeles fires, State Farm got approval to
hike insurance rates by 17%
.
Still, California's discounts are far lower than in the Gulf States, often less than 10%. And no discount program helps with an even faster-growing concern for homeowners: losing insurance altogether. Almost 2 million Americans were dropped by their insurance companies from 2018 to 2023, with the biggest impact in counties at highest risk from disasters,
according to a report
from the Senate Budget Committee.

As hurricanes, wildfires and storms get more intense with climate change, disaster experts say it's crucial for entire communities to retrofit homes to withstand what's coming — and for insurance companies to take that into account when deciding whether to offer coverage.
Colorado lawmakers recently passed a bill
to set up a wildfire insurance discount program there.
""The discount is nice and it's a positive development, but it doesn't matter if they won't write you the insurance,"" says Dave Jones, former insurance commissioner of California and now director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley Law. ""While focus on the discount is important, there needs to be an even greater focus on getting the insurers' models that they use to decide whether to write and renew insurance to account for these things.""
Alabama invests in up-front protection
On the Alabama coast, the wind and rain act as a one-two punch.
The first blow comes as winds strip roofs of shingles and any other form of protection. The second hit arrives when rain pours through the exposed openings and rots the inside, from family photos to drywall.
Climate
These houses survived one of the country's worst wildfires. Here's how
Damage from hurricanes in the mid-2000s — from Ivan to Katrina — led to home insurance wind premiums
more than tripling
in some cases, according to the Alabama Department of Insurance. In the years since, tens of thousands of policyholders lost home insurance altogether.
To address the one-two threat from storms, Alabama came up with a one-two solution in 2012 by adopting the
FORTIFIED
Roof standard, a set of rules to follow when building a roof to make it more resistant to storm damage.
The first part comes from installing a waterproof stick-on layer to a roof to prevent rain from getting through, even if the wind strips away some shingles. The second part involves stopping that from happening in the first place by using ring shank nails — specialized ridged nails that are much harder to pull out than their smooth counterparts, even during high winds.

""I tell people all the time, Mother Nature is undefeated,"" Travis Taylor, acting director of Alabama's Office of Risk and Resilience, says. ""But we have to do what we can do to limit the exposure we have, limit the damage, by fortifying.""
When Hurricane Sally hit Alabama in 2020, fortified roofs outperformed those on homes that weren't part of the program. A recent study by Alabama's insurance department found that homeowners with fortified roofs filed
fewer insurance claims
and claimed less damage.

""Getting a good, certified roof is a lot,"" says Baldwin County homeowner Watson, who recently observed contractors install a fortified roof on his home. ""Watching them do it I realized, man, all the ones I had done before wasn't near as good as this one is.""
Damage from fallen trees remains a major expense, a danger from storms that fortified roofs are not designed to protect against.
Alabama and insurance companies offer a financial incentive
Large parts of the Alabama coastline have adopted building codes similar to the FORTIFIED standards for both new constructions and reroofing old ones. Still, a new roof can cost around $10,000, in some cases well more. So Alabama developed a strategy for getting homeowners to switch over.
First, the state required insurers to provide at least a 20% discount on the wind premium for a fortified roof starting in 2014. The savings is only on the wind portion of the homeowners insurance. But along the Alabama coast that can be as much as 80% of the total premium, meaning this discount can save customers hundreds of dollars each year.
The second incentive involved the state paying for the installation. The Strengthen Alabama Homes grant program
covers up to $10,000
of the cost, not counting an inspection. Every three months, Alabama homeowners on the coast refresh the program's website, hoping to be one of the lucky ones to get in and receive a grant when the application goes live. Since the grants started in 2016, about 8,500 homes have been retrofitted with that funding, and the state now plans to offer grants in some counties farther north for the first time this November.

""I almost cried. I was like this is too good to be true,"" says Richard Kindle, a homeowner in Spanish Fort, Ala., who received the grant. ""This was a program I really needed to get in on.""
Louisiana
and
Mississippi
have since adopted insurance discount programs just like Alabama's.
""There are states that are copying our program down to the letter,"" Taylor says. ""Everywhere the word 'Alabama' is mentioned, they replace it with their own state.""
Californians weigh the state's smaller discounts
In Oakland, Calif., Elizabeth Stage doesn't have to imagine what a wildfire might do to her neighborhood, where the hills are covered in dense brush. She saw it firsthand in 1991, when the Oakland Hills Fire destroyed more than 3,000 homes.
""The '91 fire got within two houses of mine,"" Stage says. ""House next door was unscathed, and the one past that was completely charred on one side.""
Elizabeth Stage points out the new siding on her Oakland, Calif., home. It used to be made of wood but now is a fire-resistant material that can better withstand the onslaught of burning embers in a wildfire.

So a few years ago, as she started planning some much-needed home maintenance, Stage knew it was an opportunity to reduce the risk her home faces. Her redwood deck was replaced with a composite material that's less likely to ignite. The roof and siding were also replaced with less-flammable materials. The windows were upgraded to dual-pane tempered glass, which resists high temperatures that can break other windows. She already made sure that flammable vegetation was trimmed away within 5 feet of the house every year.
To get a discount on her insurance, Stage needed her home to be
certified with an inspection
from the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, a research group funded by the insurance industry that studies what makes homes burn, even
subjecting building materials to showers of embers
. The cost is $125 for the inspection, but Stage realized that her home still has a wooden staircase on one side, which would disqualify her.
Sponsor Message
At best, her insurance company would offer her up to 15% off her premium. Stage is still planning on fixing the staircase, but getting the discount isn't her motivation.
""It would be frosting on the cake,"" she says. ""Before I worry about my premiums, I need to worry about a nonrenewal notice."" She's hoping it's a way to avoid being dropped by her insurance company, as has happened to many of her neighbors.
For many homeowners, the savings of a few hundred dollars isn't enough to justify doing the expensive projects needed to qualify. Replacing a roof or siding with fire-resistant building materials or cutting back flammable trees can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
In Berkeley, Calif., Bill Pottinger has already cleared the flammable vegetation around his hillside home, but he says the discount doesn't justify going through the certification process.
""So far, it hasn't been a strongly motivating factor,"" Pottinger says. ""If it ever looked as if that made the difference between my being able to get insured, or at rates that were in the vicinity of $500 to $1,000 in premium difference, that's a much different picture.""
How insurance discounts could drive more disaster prep
California's insurance discount program, known as
Safer from Wildfires
, was established in late 2022. For the largest insurance companies, the maximum discounts offered to customers range from 8% to 15%. To get those full discounts, companies generally require all aspects of the home be ""hardened"" or fireproofed, including the windows, eaves, roof, siding at the base of the house, gates and fences near the house and management of all flammable vegetation. Individually, each of those items generally qualifies for a 0.5% or 1% discount.
""I don't think these amounts will cause behavior to change,"" says Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. ""Window replacement, siding replacement — that is not something you do to save 2% of $2,000 a year.""
Houses can sometimes survive extreme wildfires, like this one in Los Angeles' Palisades Fire. Building experts say retrofitting groups of homes with fire-resistant materials and cutting back flammable vegetation increases the chances the neighborhood will remain unscathed.

The discount amounts are set by the insurance companies. They have to justify them to state regulators and show they reflect how property owners reduce their risk. California insurance regulators say while there's decades of research showing how much hurricane improvements reduce claims costs, the benefits of wildfire improvements are still being studied.
Sponsor Message
""These percentages will grow and be refined as more data come in,"" says Michael Peterson, deputy commissioner of climate and sustainability for the California Department of Insurance. ""We will get more information on the performance of those actions and then be able to do similar things that really hold the whole system accountable for having percentages of discounts that do reflect the real risk reduction.""
Insurance experts also point out that wildfires can be a more difficult hazard for a homeowner to prepare for. While replacing a roof may be fairly straightforward in hurricane country, protecting a home from wildfire can mean retrofitting many parts of the house, as well as continually maintaining flammable vegetation in the yard.
The 1991 Oakland Hills fire killed 25 people. Much of the housing in the area still has wood siding or other building materials that are prone to igniting and spreading fire.

""We are in a fundamentally different position than Alabama,"" Wara says about California. ""The benefits of a super roof are fully captured by the person that makes the investment. One of the challenges with fire is that it matters what your neighbors do too."" Even when one homeowner prepares for a wildfire, their house may still be vulnerable if a neighbor's property is overgrown and starts to burn, because the powerful radiant heat can ignite nearby structures.
Insurance experts say if homeowners could avoid losing their insurance by doing disaster retrofitting, the programs could see far more participation. Currently, insurance companies in California don't have to consider whether someone has done wildfire improvements when they decide whether to renew a policy. (An exception is the company CSAA, which says customers can keep their insurance for at least three years if their home is wildfire certified.)
""This is a huge problem and one that insurers can and should address by making sure the models they use to decide whether to write or renew insurance account for empirically proven property and landscape-scale adaptation,"" Jones says. ""They need to begin to do it, or states are going to pass laws to require it.""

California state legislators
introduced a bill in 2020
that would have required insurance companies to offer policies for wildfire-prepared homes, but the bill quickly failed. The state has started a
program to help entire neighborhoods
retrofit their homes, which is now working with pilot groups. A bill being considered by the Legislature, the
California Safe Homes Act
, would also provide grant money for home projects.
As the damage from disasters continues to escalate, experts say reducing the risk entire neighborhoods face is vital to keeping insurance available and affordable.
""The benefits of wildfire safety for insurance are that the lower the risk, the more insurable the property,"" Peterson says. ""And so if we can align the actions and the incentives for wildfire safety, it has benefits for insurance.""

Weeks after wildfires
burned more than 16,000 homes and buildings
around Los Angeles this winter, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered Congress a grim view of America's insurance markets.
Premiums across the U.S. have jumped 24% on average in the past few years,
according to the Consumer Federation of America
, in part because climate change is driving
more intense
storms, floods and wildfires. Insurers and banks have already retreated from some of the riskiest parts of the U.S., Powell told lawmakers, like coastal communities and areas prone to blazes, including parts of California.

""If you fast-forward 10 or 15 years,""
Powell said
, ""there are going to be regions of the country where you can't get a mortgage.""
Climate
How climate change could cause a home insurance meltdown
The consequences of that kind of meltdown would be profound. People
need insurance to get a mortgage
to buy a house. If people can't get mortgages, property values fall. That strains local governments, which depend on property taxes — linked to home values — to fund public services like police and firefighters. As insurers drop customers in high-risk areas, a lot of Americans have been pushed onto
expensive state-run plans with limited coverage
. That means homeowners who lose insurance often struggle after disasters to rebuild or move.
""Everything has a price,"" says Ben Keys, a real estate and finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And so, it's not that areas become uninhabitable. It's that it's so wildly unaffordable to find insurance that only the very wealthiest people could afford to live there — to bear those kinds of risks themselves.""
For insurers, the bill for disasters keeps growing. One way to lower the cost is for homeowners and communities to better protect themselves from storms and fires by investing in things like fortified roofs and by thinning forest vegetation. That kind of work has already started.

At its core, this is about the cost of disasters.

The amount of money insurers have paid out when extreme weather damages or destroys property has grown by between 5% and 7% annually in recent years,
according to Swiss Re
, a major reinsurer, which essentially sells insurance to insurance companies. If that trend holds, the industry will face close to $145 billion of insured losses globally in 2025, Swiss Re said in an April report. The Los Angeles wildfires alone inflicted around $40 billion of insured losses, the firm said.

Why knowing your neighbors can be an important climate solution
Disaster costs are rising for several reasons. People
continue to move
to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to forested areas prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. When homes get damaged or destroyed, inflation has made it more expensive to rebuild. All the while, the rising temperatures that fuel more extreme weather are caused primarily by burning fossil fuels that
insurance companies themselves continue to underwrite and invest in
.
Insurers have responded by increasing their prices to reflect the growing risks. That has raised insurance costs for homeowners and would-be homebuyers across the United States. In some places, including parts of California, Florida and North Carolina, insurers have gone further,
dropping customers
to shield themselves from ballooning losses.
Almost 2 million Americans had their home insurance policies dropped between 2018 and 2023, with the biggest impact in places at highest risk of disasters,
according to Keys
, of the University of Pennsylvania.

Some Los Angeles homes made it through the firestorm. Here's how
""We have an insurance-availability challenge that we're facing in some states, as well as growing affordability concerns,"" says Karen Collins, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group.
Insurance experts, industry representatives and consumer advocates interviewed by NPR largely agree that to shore up insurance markets, homes and communities have to become more resilient. That means they have to be located and built to better survive the extreme weather being amped up by climate change. But there's deep disagreement about how that should happen.

Who's responsible for making homes and communities more resilient?
Consumer and industry advocates say everyone bears responsibility to make housing more resilient: homeowners and communities, insurers, and local, state and federal lawmakers. But getting the different players to agree and take action gets tricky.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, vented at a
May Senate hearing
on home insurance that everyone talks about protecting communities when disasters happen, but then the issue is forgotten until the next catastrophe.

Faced with rising temps, Las Vegas is embracing a simple climate solution: More trees
""We've got to stop talking about resiliency and then you go home, you get political pushback, you don't do it,"" Tillis said. ""We need local and state officials to have the courage to tell their communities what they need to do to be more resilient. And the federal government needs to reward those who will, and deny funding for those who don't.""
Alex Epstein, a fossil fuel advocate at the same hearing, offered a different view: Preparing for disasters should be the homeowner's responsibility. And insurers should charge whatever they think is appropriate. The idea, Epstein said, is that if premiums skyrocket, it signals to the public where it's safe to live and what people need to do to protect themselves.
""You just need to allow total freedom of insurance markets to act in response to risk,"" Epstein said.
But just letting insurers raise prices for something most Americans have to purchase for homeownership isn't a solution, says Douglas Heller, insurance director at the Consumer Federation of America.
""You can't require people to buy something and then make it impossible for them to afford it,"" Heller says.

As disaster costs and insurance premiums have risen, Heller says, a lot of homeowners and communities have tried to do their part by making their properties more resilient. The problem, he says, is that insurers do little to account for those efforts.

Industry-funded
grants are available in Alabama

Among the places hardest hit by insurance market turmoil is Lake County, California. Located about 130 miles north of San Francisco, more than 5% of the area's housing stock has burned in wildfires in the past decade, Jessica Pyska, a county supervisor,
said at the May Senate hearing
on insurance markets. The loss of more than 2,000 homes has been especially devastating in a county where residents are
older and poorer
than the
national average
. Still, Lake County has managed to become ""a model for disaster mitigation and community preparedness,"" Pyska told lawmakers.

Homeowners have installed fire-resistant roofs and noncombustible siding. Pyska said vegetation has also been cleared to create what's called defensible space around homes and fuel breaks to protect critical infrastructure.
But despite those efforts, ""we continue to be crushed by the insurance crisis plaguing our nation,"" Pyska said at the hearing. Insurance options in Lake County keep dwindling — the area had one of the country's
highest rates of insurance nonrenewal
in 2023. And residents who can find coverage have seen premiums double or triple, she said. As a result, new housing development has stalled, and more homes sit vacant because buyers can't get insurance.
""We are doing as much as we can right now,"" Pyska said, ""and everything is on the line.""

Is anyone trying to help communities like Lake County?
That's exactly what a group of homeowners, insurance experts and environmentalists is trying to do in the forest of Northern California.
In the Sierra Nevada, a homeowners association called Tahoe Donner said this year that it had convinced an insurer to provide
coverage that accounts for the community's efforts to reduce threats from wildfires
, including by thinning trees and
conducting prescribed burns
.
""We convinced an insurer, based on our demonstration that forest management reduces risk, to write insurance in an area in the middle of the forest where other insurers are not writing,"" says Jones of UC Berkeley Law, who owns property in Tahoe Donner.

But it's just a first step. The policy covers only the association's forested and recreational land — not homes — and it's still ""incredibly challenging"" for residents there to get insurance, says Annie Rosenfeld, Tahoe Donner's general manager.
However, Rosenfeld says the policy should serve as a test case for the home insurance industry.
""For [insurers], they need to have some assurance that not only you've hardened your home, but the community has done that larger, broad-scale risk mitigation — [and] that we can quantify it,"" says Jason Hajduk-Dorworth, Tahoe Donner's director of administrative services and a former fire chief in Santa Cruz, California.

If insurers refuse to account for those kinds of initiatives, then Jones says state lawmakers should force the issue. He pointed to a law that Colorado Gov. Jared Polis
signed in May
requiring insurers that use risk models to consider actions that homeowners and communities take to protect themselves — including home hardening and forest management — when they assess the risk that a property will burn in a wildfire.

What do insurers say?
Collins, of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, disputes that insurers ignore investments that homeowners and communities are making to protect themselves.
Battered by surging costs, insurers have been regrouping, Collins says, limiting how much coverage they can provide in certain markets.
""It's not a matter of [investments in resilience] not being recognized,"" Collins says. ""It's a matter of each company is in a different place with what their capacity is to lean into the market.""
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
How climate change is reshaping life on the Mighty Mississippi
Once insurers are in a position again to grow their business in those areas, ""you better believe that they're going to be looking at what are the most attractive risks,"" Collins adds. ""And if your home has been mitigated and shows clearly that it has taken steps to reduce the likelihood or extent of damage, it is going to be more attractive.""
An industry-backed group working on resilience is the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. Michael Newman, the group's general counsel, told Congress that when homeowners make verifiable, science-based investments to reduce risk, ""insurers will pay attention.""
But that's not translating into action, says Jones, of UC Berkeley Law. ""The industry is well aware of the risk-reduction benefits of home hardening, defensible space and landscape-scale forest treatment,"" he says. ""What's frustrating is that so far, except for what we've done with this insurance product [at Tahoe Donner], it's not being accounted for.""
Sponsor Message
The question, then, is how to encourage more of those kinds of arrangements. Susan Crawford, a senior fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, doubts state legislation forcing the industry's hand will be effective.
Insurers have plenty of places to do business, Crawford says, and ""it may not be in their interest to spend money to differentiate among communities that have invested in particular ways.""
Ultimately, there would need to be a sort of grand bargain between the public and private sectors, she says. If states and localities strengthen building codes and land-use policies, for example, insurers could help obtain government grant funding to aid lower-income homeowners in making the necessary upgrades to their property. Then, Crawford says, insurers would be encouraged to offer more attractive coverage in that area.
So far, though, there haven't been enough incentives — or pressure — to hammer out that kind of deal. State and local officials face blowback when they call for measures that could make communities more resilient, because they often cost constituents money. Meanwhile, insurers don't think it's their job to push for building-code and land-use reform, Crawford says. And housing developers worry about changes that could drive up home prices and hurt demand.
Workers with JAS Builders and Payne Construction Services raise a home with jacks and framing material in May in Treasure Island, Florida.

Are there limits to how much communities and insurers can adapt to climate risks?
There are limits, according to Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz, a German financial company with a big insurance business. And those limits are approaching fast.
""The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay,"" Thallinger wrote in a
March LinkedIn post
that went viral in climate and insurance circles. As temperatures keep rising, ""adaptation itself becomes economically unviable.""
That leaves one option, Thallinger said: Reduce heat-trapping emissions by burning less fossil fuel or by capturing climate pollution before it's released into the atmosphere.

""I think we need to be up-front with ourselves and with the next generation,"" St. George said, ""that this is a very hard problem to solve without getting to the root of things.""

stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
Ron Watson's new roof doesn't just protect him from storms. It's saving him money, too.
That's because it's a special roof specifically designed to withstand the strong winds and torrential rains of hurricane season in Alabama, where Watson lives. Fortified by wind-resistant nails and a waterproof underlayer, it reduces the risk that his home will be destroyed in a storm. And less risk means lower insurance premiums. Which is a big deal.

""Homeowners' insurance now has been through the roof because of the storms we've had through here,"" Watson says.
Homeowners' insurance isn't just getting more expensive. It's also getting harder to secure in the first place. Across the country, an increase in climate-related disasters like heat waves, wildfire  and hurricanes is
creating challenges for both insurers and their customers
. One solution? Climate-proofing houses like Watson's, and incentivizing that process through state government.
Still, not all states or homeowners face similar risks. And insurers aren't legally required to take climate-proofing into account when assessing the insurability of a home. That's why states are experimenting with different programs — and insurance legislation — to find a fix.

When Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Jersey Shore in 2012, it damaged houses up and down the coast. But not Amanda Devecka-Rinear's home.
The small wooden house survived untouched. It happened to be lifted on pilings for construction work, so it stayed above the floodwaters.
She says it felt incredibly lucky that the house survived the storm, while homes around it were devastated.
""What are the chances that it was up in the air when Sandy hit?"" she says.
When Devecka-Rinear's great-grandfather bought the house nearly a century ago, it sat much lower to the ground. Now, the house is elevated nearly 13 feet above sea level.

New Jersey is hoping elevation will save a lot of other homes too.
Since Sandy, property owners have invested heavily in raising homes along the coast.
Climate change is making extreme rain more common and is supercharging storms,
raising the risk of dangerous flooding across much of the United States
. In places like coastal New Jersey,
sea levels are rising and the land is sinking
.
The safest option is to move people out of the riskiest flood zones, experts say. But that's not always practical. In many places, raising homes well off the ground can help protect them from flooding, allowing people to stay in the communities they love.
""We have millions of homes at risk in flood plains in the country,"" says Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. ""Home elevation, I think, is one of those techniques that you're going to see used more and more as our nation faces increasing losses from flooding.""

In some parts of coastal New Jersey these days, it's more unusual to see a house that isn't elevated than one that is.
But elevation is expensive, and raising homes alone won't fully protect a community from flooding. Devecka-Rinear's experience holds some lessons for the rest of the country.
Sea levels along the Jersey Shore have risen about a foot and a half since the early 1900s, as climate change drives ocean levels higher and the land sinks. That's more than twice the global average, according to Rutgers University.

Coastal New Jersey transformed after Sandy
While Devecka-Rinear's grandmother's house was spared, other houses on Cedar Bonnet Island weren't so lucky. Her father's house next door was damaged so badly it had to be torn down and rebuilt.
""My whole neighborhood got trashed,"" she says. ""It was like an act of God that this house didn't, and I wasn't going to take that for granted, right?""
So when Devecka-Rinear moved into her grandmother's house the following year, she knew she wanted to elevate it permanently.
""Talk about scared straight — like, I'm going to be trying to lift this house if I can,"" she says.

After the storm, some shore towns
doubled down on building and reinforcing

An expensive solution
Raising a house is expensive. Elevating her home nearly 13 feet above sea level ended up costing more than $140,000, Devecka-Rinear says.

In 2017, her town received some funding from FEMA to help property owners elevate. But it covered only a dozen households.
The grant would cover most of Devecka-Rinear's costs, but she had to come up with the money up front, before being reimbursed. Plus, she had to rent another home while hers was under construction. So, she borrowed money from family. She's still paying it back.

Devecka-Rinear says some people couldn't afford to rebuild, so they sold their homes to those who could: often
developers or wealthier buyers
. Over time, she says, she watched her island change.
""Every time there's a storm, or even with COVID — that was a disaster — the folks that are more working class or middle class end up moving out, and then folks with more money end up moving in,"" she says.
Because of the cost, home elevation doesn't always make sense for homeowners, says
Tracy Kijewski-Correa
, a professor of engineering and global affairs at the University of Notre Dame who studies disaster risk reduction. In many places, the cost of elevation is similar to the cost of a home, and families cannot expect to recoup the investment when they go to sell their house.

Households that can't afford to elevate are left vulnerable to the next storm, she says.
Stafford Township has been particularly proactive in going after federal money to help residents elevate. The township has applied for several federal grants since receiving the one that helped Devecka-Rinear. But not every town has that capacity.
And the future of federal resources available for this kind of risk-mitigation work is uncertain. The Trump administration has suggested
transforming or eliminating FEMA
, the agency that funds much of this work.
Devecka-Rinear now leads the
New Jersey Organizing Project
, a nonprofit that advocates for storm survivors. She says there needs to be more funding available to help families elevate their homes before and after disasters. And, she says, grants need to reach disaster survivors faster.
""I will do everything I can to continue to make sure that regular people and working families like mine don't end up on the losing end of this,"" she says.
Building standards in flood zones are based on Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps that use historical data and are often out of date.

""Future-proofing"" homes and communities
Elevating homes alone won't protect communities from rising flood risk. Key roadways, as well as water, sewer and electrical infrastructure, need to be protected, too, for elevated homes to stay functional during and after a flood.
""You can have a bunch of amazing structures that survive, but no water, no power and no ability to come back and actually use them,"" Kijewski-Correa says.
Stafford Township plans to eventually raise flood-prone roads, after replacing sewers and helping more homeowners elevate. The town has already elevated one road on a different part of Devecka-Rinear's island, which used to flood at high tide.

Earthaven Ecovillage is a community of around 100 full-time residents tucked away in  the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina. In late September, this idyllic place with its modest homes, babbling creeks and bumpy country roads was rocked as Hurricane Helene swept into the Carolinas, dropping torrential rainfall and bringing high winds. Across the state, more than 100 people died, and billions of dollars in property was damaged.
However, unlike other places such as Asheville, N.C.,

was relatively unscathed.

The power briefly went down when the village's hydroelectric system was temporarily damaged. Residents quickly implemented their backup solar system. The main road also washed out in places, and fallen trees made it impassable. But the community was able to quickly clear the blocked roads and make repairs because the village had chain saws and tractors. The residents also produce much of their food — fruits, vegetables and livestock. So no one went hungry. Few buildings suffered damage, and no one was badly injured.

""But the bigger point is we are hitting a wall as a species, right? I see ecovillages as beta test centers. They're laboratories for how all of us can live in greater harmony with the planet.""
Amy Belanger sits inside her Earthaven home, which is known as ""the Hobbit House"" because it's built into a hillside and has a quaint round door. The home was among the very few at Earthaven damaged during Hurricane Helene. A tree hit her roof, and the two upper levels of her home were mangled. Though some of her fellow community members helped pull the tree off, the house is still unlivable at the moment.

The residents of Earthaven see themselves in this way. "" It's a social experiment,"" said Earthaven's Greenstein. ""Can we help each other to meet our needs and meet them so that we can live in a harmonious way?""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, residents pulled together on many fronts.
Rachel Fee, a farmer who has lived at the ecovillage for eight years, did a lot of cooking in the weeks following Hurricane Helene. ""I ran a kitchen on whatever kind of disparate food items we had and fed a hundred people,"" Fee said. The residents even held a big pig roast about a week after the storm.

Monique Mazza, a licensed practitioner of naturopathic medicine who came to Earthaven nine years ago, set up a health and wellness clinic. ""I brought whatever I had medically, including enough stuff to start an IV if we had to,"" she said.
Andy Bosley, who has lived at Earthaven for 23 years, put his electrician and handyman skills to work by monitoring Earthaven's power systems. He's also good at keeping a level head, and so he took charge of community meetings. ""It's sort of like being prepared, but not being a prepper and hoarding everything and having guns, and 'I've got a year's supply of stuff and you can't touch it,'"" Bosley said. "" Really, we rely on each other collectively.""
Earthaveners try to be as self-sustainable as possible. The community produces much of its own power and food. The food stores and solar power were particularly handy during Hurricane Helene and in its aftermath. The storm, for example, damaged their hydroelectric system, knocking out power, but they had solar as a backup.

Collectivity as a climate solution
Collaborative efforts are not uncommon at ecovillages.
""Ecovillages are good at sharing resources, being very connected and knowing who has the tools and the skills that are needed for any given moment,"" said Allyson Quinlan, the co-author of a 2024 Global Ecovillage Network
report
looking at the climate resilience of ecovillages around the world. Quinlan is the executive director of
Resilience Alliance
, a group that researches the resilience of social-ecological systems. The Global Ecovillage Network collaborated with Quinlan's organization on the study.
The report examined 20 ecovillages in 18 countries to find out how well these communities could cope if the planet warmed by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit). The Earth is
currently on track
to warm even more than that by the end of the century unless humans dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions.
NPR's Climate Solutions Week
This city is exploring an unconventional solution to water scarcity: sewage
While areas for improvement include ramping up early warning systems and emergency plans, the report found a strong sense of social cohesion, self-organization and participation to be among the greatest strengths of ecovillages when it comes to their ability to cope with the impacts of climate change. ""There's a lot we can learn from ecovillages about supporting one another and connecting as a community,"" Quinlan said.
Earthaven's Council Hall is the main meeting place for residents. The community is self-governing, so many decisions get made in this yurtlike building. ""This building was designed to accommodate our governance council,"" said Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron. ""It's a 35-foot circle, and that number was basically brought forth from data that suggested that at that size, people in a circle can see the facial expressions of the people across the circle. Once it gets bigger than that, then you start to lose that connection.""

Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron grew up in Michigan and wanted to start an intentional community built on anticonsumerist, collectivist, permaculture-based principles long before Earthaven came into being. He was already living near the North Carolina site that would eventually become Earthaven when he met a group of people with similar plans. They went in together on a $440,000 tract of heavily forested land and started clearing it to build housing and communal spaces.

Before physically establishing the community, they laid down its guiding principles in writing. "" We agreed that we would do permaculture, natural building and we would practice consensus,"" said co-founder Arjuna da Silva. Da Silva is talking about a form of collective decision-making where everyone has to agree before moving ahead.
"" We had an explicit agreement that we signed that was that we're not allowed to hold grudges,"" Caron said. ""We're not allowed to continue to have a conflict that you don't work on."" Earthaven has in recent years modified its approach to self-governance; now an 85% majority has to agree for a plan to proceed.
Conflict resolution training is offered to anyone who stays at Earthaven and is required for anyone who wants to become a member. A resident can become a member after living at the ecovillage for anywhere between one and several years while the community and the individual decide whether they are a good fit.
Caron said people in his community model collaborative behaviors because togetherness is one of Earthaven's core principles. ""It's not a spiritual ideology that's holding it together,"" he said. ""It's the foundation of that cooperative culture that we've actually created.""
The cooperative culture shows up in many aspects of life at Earthaven today, from hashing out disagreements at community meetings to the regular Friday night music jams. And it showed up in the residents' response during the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
Earthaven co-founder Paul Caron was living in the area in the 1990s when he met the people with whom he would go on to create the ecovillage. "" The original founding vision was to model a village, kind of like going back to an earlier pattern so that we can regroup as a species to go forward, basically. That's what Earthaven really is — a social experiment more than a physical experiment.""

The downside to interconnectedness
The interconnectedness also comes with downsides when dealing with the impacts of climate change.
Lack of diversity is a big one for Earthaven. While there is socioeconomic range, the residents are largely white. It has been that way since the beginning.
Resident Chloe Vieira is concerned about the lack of racial diversity. ""If we have a monochromatic set of people, we're gonna get a certain answer,"" said Vieira. "" But if we have a diversity of backgrounds, then people are gonna be looking at that question from multiple angles and we're just gonna come up with a better answer.""
Zev Friedman explores the greenhouse next to his home. ""The things that make good community are also the things that make effective disaster response.""

Resident Zev Friedman is worried about how whiteness can lead to patterns that cause gentrification. ""A gentrifying ecovillage leans towards insulating us from what's going on in the world,"" Friedman said. ""And therefore being less willing to take on truly transformational ideas and actions around what it would mean for us to play a significant role in true climate adaptation.""

Residents NPR spoke with said they want Earthaven to grow in size and be more diverse. There are advantages and disadvantages to this aspiration when it comes to climate change.
""If it's done well, integrating lots of new people can really increase resilience because you have a bigger and more varied pool of people, skills and capacities, and can leverage a greater collective intelligence,"" said Anna Kovasna, the strategic lead for community resilience at the Global Ecovillage Network. ""But it can also lead to splits and conflicts. So it tests the shared vision and purpose, which is really important to ecovillages.""
Earthaven's approximately 100 residents share an idyllic forested landscape. It has become more expensive to buy land and start an ecovillage from scratch since the 1990s, when Earthaven was founded. But co-founder Paul Caron says the ideals of communal living offer lessons to everyone — even those of us living in urban environments.

Looking outward
Part of Earthaven's effort to increase its diversity and potential size involves increasing public awareness of the village and its sustainable practices. It does this by running public tours and workshops on topics like climate resilience, permaculture and solar energy, mostly through its on-site
School of Integrated Living
.
""The main thing is to get people to come here, see what it is and go, 'Hmm, what could I do in my life to develop something like this?'"" Earthaven co-founder Caron said.
Caron said even people who have no interest in starting an ecovillage — which has become increasingly expensive and difficult to do in the United States owing to high land prices and strict regulatory frameworks — or even joining an existing one, can learn how to live more sustainable lives right in their own neighborhoods from places like Earthaven. He said he wants communities everywhere to work collectively to be more resilient when it comes to adapting to climate change.
""Everybody can't move to the country and found an ecovillage in the woods. But everybody can join with their neighbors and figure out ways to cooperate,"" Caron said. ""Like, if you've got three suburban lawns right next to each other, you don't need but one lawnmower. It's as simple as that.""
The cooperative spirit of Earthaven's residents saw the community through Hurricane Helene. But the residents say there is still work to be done to make themselves even more resilient.

Trees in the desert are like oxygen at high altitude — scarce and precious.
During a recent spring tree giveaway sponsored by Nevada's Clark County, the team had a couple of hundred young trees ready and lined up for residents. All the trees disappeared within an hour.
Lulu Banks was eligible for two free trees. That's because her neighborhood in North Las Vegas is a designated ""urban heat island"" — a specific area that's hotter than other neighborhoods, in part because of lack of shade.

She knew exactly where she was going to plant the new trees: one close to her front window and another outside her bedroom. She hopes the shade will help lower her air conditioning bill in the summer.
Research has shown that trees can lower the temperature in the area around them significantly, by at least 10 degrees. And Las Vegas needs all the cooling it can get.

It prompted an increased focus on finding ways to help keep people safe from the heat.
The Undercount: The invisible death toll from climate change
Climate change is deadly. Exactly how deadly?
In May, state lawmakers passed a bill requiring the state's biggest cities and counties to
create heat mitigation plans
by next summer; it was signed into law this month.
In Las Vegas, the city, county and nonprofits are all stepping up efforts to plant more trees and provide more shade — especially in the hottest neighborhoods.
The lack of tree canopy in many of Las Vegas' neighborhoods is an important issue. Research has shown trees can lower the temperature in the area around them by at least 10 degrees. Temperatures can range significantly more depending on the surroundings, but even 10 degrees can make a big difference.

Tackling ""shade disparity""
Across the U.S., studies show heat
disproportionately affects lower-income neighborhoods
because they tend to have older, less-energy-efficient homes and
often have little tree canopy
.
Ariel Choinard calls it ""shade disparity.""
Choinard leads the Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab, which studies how heat affects people and communities and then recommends data-based solutions. The lab was created in 2023 and is funded primarily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal agency.
Studies show heat disproportionately affects lower-income neighborhoods. This has a ripple effect, according to Ariel Choinard of the Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab. People in these neighborhoods end up paying more to cool their homes. And they may have to choose between keeping their home at a livable temperature and other necessities like food or medication.

In April, Choinard visited several urban heat island neighborhoods to demonstrate how the built environment can dramatically increase surface temperatures, and the significant difference trees can make.

A

""Folks here have to work harder and longer to afford to cool their homes,"" Choinard said. ""And we know that people make really tough trade-offs when it's superhot.""
That can mean choosing between keeping their homes at a safe and comfortable temperature and paying for groceries, or limiting medication.
Choinard pointed out a mature tree providing plenty of shade in a neighborhood without many others.
""It's this tree that's doing really great work here,"" she said.

On this day in April, it was 95 degrees out. But under the tree, it was much cooler. Choinard measured the temperature on the ground with an infrared thermometer: 87 degrees.
Trees help cool the air
through a process known as transpiration cooling. Essentially, trees release water into the atmosphere from their leaves, cooling the air around them. Tree cover also provides shade, keeping sidewalks, roads and buildings from absorbing and trapping as much of the sun's heat.
At the Desert Inn Estates, a mobile home community with few trees in East Las Vegas, Choinard pointed the infrared thermometer at a picnic table sitting directly in the sun.
Many older neighborhoods and mobile home communities still have palm trees and cactuses, which provide a particular visual aesthetic but little shade. Local leaders are moving toward nonnative, drought-tolerant trees that can provide shade. Here, at the Desert Inn Estates, two palm trees stand high above a road with little other foliage.

Planting 2,000 trees a year
That's why the county, the city and nonprofits are all increasing efforts to plant more trees in the desert.
""Our 2050 goal is to plant 60,000 trees within the city of Las Vegas, and that breaks down to a little over 2,000 trees a year,"" said Brad Daseler, the city's urban forester.
Sponsor Message
Daseler is bringing in mostly nonnative plants that provide shade and are drought tolerant, like oak trees from northern Mexico and eucalyptus trees from Australia.
""Las Vegas is a pretty challenging environment for plant material in general because we do get so warm, but we also have the ability to freeze,"" Daseler said. ""So finding trees that can survive in both of those climate extremes absolutely is a challenge.""
And you can't just plant any tree in any place, Daseler says. There's nuance and strategy to what kind of trees are chosen for what areas.
Walking through the city tree nursery, he pointed out a young bur oak.
""Those would be trees that we would use more in our park spaces,"" he said. Other trees, like the Indian rosewood, can better withstand the harshness of being planted in a median, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, with a ""high heat load.""
The region is currently
in a drought
that the U.S. Drought Monitor has classified as ""exceptional"" — its severest category.
So there's a delicate balancing act, Daseler said, in maximizing both trees and water.
That's a constant challenge in the desert, says Choinard.
""There's always that question of, what is the highest use of a gallon of water?"" she said. ""But when we're talking about the long-term viability of our communities, I think a tree is a great thing to put water on.""
Planting trees for their specific environment is an important piece of the puzzle, according to Brad Daseler. For example, he might choose to plant a tree with a smaller profile to fit a narrower patch of sidewalk or a backyard garden, versus a city park. Here, Daseler points out tree pots with a textured felt lining that helps keep roots from binding up. ""There's a lot of nuance to planting trees,"" Daseler says.

""Don't give plants too much water, but you need it to have some water so it can grow,""  said third-grader Donovan Pantoja.

His mom, Natalie Hernandez, said the project instills positive life lessons, and teaches kids to be environmentally conscious.

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to
stories about solutions
for building and living on a hotter planet.
Our homes use
a lot
of energy. The huge amounts of energy used to operate buildings result in
more than a fourth of the world's planet heating carbon dioxide pollution
.
One home climate solution is to switch to appliances that make less pollution, like switching from a gas furnace to an efficient heat pump.
But it turns out you don't have to buy a new appliance to cool or heat your home in a more climate-friendly way. Climate solutions for reducing home energy use can be extremely simple — and sometimes even free, says

These 5 big purchases can save energy — and money — at home
A more energy-efficient home often comes down to
gaining less heat
in hot months and
losing less heat
in cold months, Aviv says. Here are five simple solutions to reduce your home's climate pollution, make your home more resilient to global warming and reduce your energy bills.
Open a window
Aviv says we're so used to thinking about thermostats or turning on the air conditioning as the main way to control our home's temperature. But many of us live in temperate environments, at least for part of the year.
In the spring or in the evenings, instead of turning on the air conditioner — which not only uses electricity but releases potent planet-heating gases called hydrofluorocarbons — Aviv has another idea.
""A lot of the time,"" she says, ""all you need to do is to actually open your windows to be comfortable.""
Life Kit
Take on climate change at home and cut carbon emissions. Here's how
Even better, Aviv says? Open up two windows to create a cross breeze if you have cross-facing windows in your home. Researchers find that using natural ventilation can translate into huge energy savings —
sometimes as much as 45% depending on your local climate
.
Don't forget ceiling fans
Aviv thinks not enough people use ceiling fans. "" I think that a lot of people can install ceiling fans and don't even think about it anymore in the age of air conditioning,"" Aviv says. ""A lot of the time, you don't need air conditioning if you have a ceiling fan.""
Sponsor Message
While ceiling fans cannot lower the air temperature, they can provide increased cooling by moving the air around, which may be enough in certain climates.
Life Kit
Improve the indoor air quality in your home
Fans use a lot less energy than air conditioning. Using ceiling fans compared to air conditioners can
reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 76%
, according to researchers in Australia.
If you have a ceiling fan and aren't using it, try turning it on. Bonus points if you also can open a few windows.
Make your roof reflective
The roof is often the part of your home that receives the most sun. That sunlight hitting the roof gets absorbed in the building and translates to heat inside the house.
That's why Aviv says it might be worth looking into what's known as a ""reflective roof.""
""Reflective roofs are actually one of the easiest retrofits you can do in a house,"" she says.
A lot of roofs are covered with black or darker-color finishes, which absorb the sun's heat. With a roof coated with a white or a silvery color, the solar energy gets reflected away from the house instead of absorbed inside.
That way, Aviv says, ""you are alleviating a lot of the cooling load that your house needs.""
Less need for cooling with air conditioners also means
less money spent on utility bills
. Aviv suggests talking to a roofer who knows about different reflective paints that can help reflect sunlight.
Put your shades outside, not inside
In places that get very hot, you might want to think about installing shades on the outside of your house, not the inside, says
Daniel Barber
, professor of architectural theory at  Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
Here's why. If you have a blind or curtain inside your house, behind your windowpane,  then the sunlight coming in brings the heat inside.
Sponsor Message
If you close the blind or curtain, Barber says, ""You're basically creating a sort of a buffer, a sort of pillow of heat between the curtain and the window.""
That's why climate-minded designers are installing blinds or shades on the outside of apartments and homes, not on the inside. That way the heat stays outside your house.
Keeping the heat out using shades is a tradition dating back centuries, Barber says. In Mediterranean places like Egypt, Tunisia or Southern Europe, people use wooden shutters to keep the heat on the exterior of a building, and not bring it inside.
Seal it up
It's a basic law of physics — thermodynamics, to be precise.  ""Heat always finds a way to escape through the easiest path,"" Aviv says.
That's why in cool months when you're heating your home, you want to make sure that heat isn't escaping your house into the outdoors. Or in hot months, if you have an air-conditioning system that brings in fresh air, you want to make sure heat is not entering your home through the cracks.
Aviv says to look for ""air leaks"" that usually occur in cracks around openings like windows and doors.
Nancy ""Nan"" Ma, assistant professor of architectural engineering at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute
in Massachusetts, explains that one solution is to upgrade your windows. But for something cheaper, you can do something called ""weather stripping."" That's using a type of tape or rubber around your window frame to seal the leaks. Weather-stripping materials often cost under $10, and you can buy them at the hardware store or online.

Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to

ST. GEORGE, Utah — Water scarcity, population growth and climate change are on a collision course in the American West.
That's clear in cities like St. George, a desert community surrounded by stunning red rock cliffs and mesas in Utah's southwest corner. The population is
booming
and climate change is making
heat more intense
and
rain less reliable
. But local leaders have a plan to stretch the area's water supply by turning to its sewage — a solution that could help other drought-stricken cities, too.

That plan started with a simple math problem.
""All the water has been used. It's been called for. But yet, we have one of the fastest-growing communities in the Western United States,"" said Zach Renstrom, general manager of the Washington County Water Conservancy District in St. George.
Washington County has one of the nation's fastest-growing populations in recent years. ""We're looking at hundreds of thousands of people moving to our community, and we have no extra water for them,"" said Zach Renstrom of the Washington County Water Conservancy District. The county expects that reusing its wastewater will provide more than half of the additional water it will need to sustain growth into the 2040s.

""So, we're looking at hundreds of thousands of people moving to our community,"" said Renstrom, ""and we have no extra water for them.""
As recently as 2021, this sun-drenched outdoor recreation hub was the fastest-growing metro area in the U.S. The local population, now just over 200,000, has more than doubled since 2002. The University of Utah projects it could double again by 2050.
That's where the sewage plan comes in.
""If you want to know the true value of water, that occurs when the well goes dry,"" Zach Renstrom said. Despite the high price tag of building wastewater recycling plants, smaller communities like St. George believe it may be the best way to sustain their water supplies into a hotter, drier future.

At a construction site just east of St. George, Renstrom walked toward a maze of rebar and concrete that's slated to become a new wastewater reclamation plant by the end of 2025. Once complete, it'll take effluent from local kitchens and bathrooms and clean it with screens, bacteria and UV light.
Climate

In the near term, the treated wastewater will be sprayed on lawns and farm fields. But that will free up water for homes, too, because the county currently uses some of its drinking water for outdoor irrigation. Within two decades, Renstrom expects the district will start sending the clean water from its reclamation plants directly into the drinking supply.
Reusing water that would have otherwise flowed downstream to Lake Mead — the nation's largest reservoir — is the centerpiece of the district's
long-term water plan
. But it will come at a steep cost: over a billion dollars.

""Traditionally, I would say that you would have to be a very large, large, large municipality to be able to afford that massive infrastructure,"" Renstrom said. ""But now we're getting to the point where, even small communities like us, it's our only option.""

The tall task facing cities in the West
St. George's quandary is a microcosm of the challenges cities face across the Western U.S. as overuse and drought strain the Colorado River and the basin's seven states
fight
over how the river's water gets distributed in the future.
Climate
The Colorado River rarely reaches the sea. Here's why
Expanding wastewater reuse operations regionwide could go a long way toward easing that pressure, said UCLA water researcher Noah Garrison. There just needs to be a lot more of it.
""One of the reasons why we need to be investing in wastewater recycling now is that this isn't some hypothetical future concern we're dealing with,"" Garrison said. ""We already are seeing water scarcity and water stress in all of these regions, and developing out wastewater recycling does take time.""
While other places like
Los Angeles
,
Phoenix
and
San Francisco
recycle a lot of their sewage already, Utah reuses
less than 1%
of its wastewater statewide. A recent
analysis
Garrison co-wrote suggested that if all basin states start reusing more than half of their wastewater — as Nevada and Arizona already do — it could make up for around a third of the region's expected water shortfall.
A visit to St. George's main water source, the Virgin River, highlights the urgency.
This waterway carved the towering red rock canyon in nearby Zion National Park. But after a historically dry winter, the section snaking through St. George has become shallow enough to walk across without getting more than your ankles wet.
""This is it,"" district conservation manager Doug Bennett said as he motioned toward the meager flow. ""This is the lifeblood of the entire region.""
Before reaching the residents of St. George, the Virgin River runs through Zion National Park, attracting diverse wildlife and millions of tourists each year.

In addition to reusing water, St. George and neighboring communities have adopted conservation rules in recent years that nearly eliminate grass on new development. The district also

up to $2 per square foot to rip out their irrigated lawns — a strategy other cities from
Denver

of grass since launching in late 2022. But Bennett knows it has a lot of room left to grow, especially among local
golf courses
. That's where the region's
record dry conditions
this year could help.
St. George and surrounding communities recently passed regulations that limit grass lawns around new housing. Changing the region's mindset about water conservation may present a challenge, but successful examples from Las Vegas and elsewhere offer hope. ""It proves what can be done and that it is doable,"" Doug Bennett said. ""You just need to get people mobilized behind the effort.""

""One of the biggest threats to implementing all these programs is complacency,"" Bennett said. ""A drought can be a big motivator for people to say, 'What can I do to help?'""
Making growth sustainable in a dry, hot, booming place like St. George may be a tall task, but Bennett believes it can work. He saw it in his previous job at the water district in Las Vegas.

Bigger cities are proving the water-saving tech
Just 120 miles to the southwest, Las Vegas is St. George's glitzy neighbor, and it has been reusing wastewater on a large scale for decades.
At the Clark County Water Reclamation District's main plant, Strategic Services Manager Bud Cranor creaked open a tall, metal door. Behind it flowed some of the 100 million gallons of sewage this plant treats each day.
""Right here is all the poop from every casino, every business,"" Cranor said. ""It's like every little 12-year-old boy's dream is working at this place, because you get to make poop jokes all day.""
But for a city in the desert, it's no laughing matter.
""What we do here is absolutely vital to this valley's survival,"" he said.
Squeezing clean water from this sea of sludge has helped the Vegas metro population more than double in the past two decades. It now has nearly 2.4 million people. Conservation
efforts
have played a big role there, too. Even as Vegas welcomed hundreds of thousands of new residents, the area decreased its total water consumption — a concept known as
decoupling
.
Sponsor Message
As more communities work to ensure their residents have water for the future, Cranor believes what Vegas has accomplished can be a neon-glowing case study.
""That will become more and more of a priority as it becomes a scarcer resource,"" he said. ""So cities, if they're not already thinking about it, they're going to have to start thinking about it more.""
The Clark County Water Reclamation District's main plant in Las Vegas, Nevada, treats over 100 million gallons of sewage every day. It then releases clean water into the Las Vegas Wash, which flows to Lake Mead. ""This is the result of a lot of human ingenuity and creativity,"" Bud Cranor said, ""to figure out how to clean and treat this finite resource so that it can be reused and it can help people survive.""

What it might take to grow in the future
Now that Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other major cities have proven the concept of wastewater reuse, Newsha Ajami has seen a growing trend of smaller communities following their lead. She's a water researcher with Stanford University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
When it comes to scaling up reuse, Ajami said the technology is not the main limiting factor. Rather, ""it's often a policy problem or sort of governance structure that needs to change to embrace some of these solutions.""
Cities may face their own localized challenges, too. In St. George, one of the limiting factors is the need to
build additional reservoirs
that can store the water its reuse plants clean. Las Vegas sends its recycled water into massive Lake Mead, which is well under half-full as Western megadrought and overuse shrink large reservoirs across the West.
St. George homeowner Karen Goodfellow works on her backyard project to replace grass with water-efficient plants. The county hopes its program that pays residents to remove irrigated lawns will encourage more people to do the same.

Ultimately, Ajami said the extent to which wastewater reuse can allow a city to grow is up to its leaders, its budget and its willingness to adapt. For some communities, that may mean prioritizing pricey water infrastructure updates. She also envisions a future where reuse becomes decentralized, like a neighborhood having its own microplant or even in-home systems.
""You can do it smart,"" she said. ""For example, if you build new buildings, new homes, and say, 'OK, you know what? You're going to connect the shower water to toilets.'""
Ajami compares it to the adoption of solar panels on home roofs in recent years. As those become more common, they help a city reduce the pressure on its power grid. Expanding decentralized reuse could potentially do something comparable for a city's water supply.
Sponsor Message
""That is definitely the future,"" Ajami said. ""It might not be here now, but in the next 10-15 years, I can see more and more of that happening.""
The wastewater treatment plant being built near St. George is a sign of the changing times, too.
When Renstrom studied water management in engineering school 25 years ago, he said the biggest question about sewage was how to get rid of it.
""In my career, that has completely changed,"" Renstrom said, ""where now, people are fighting over this.""
Communities like his are counting on that sewage to sustain them into a hotter, drier future.
In St. George and across the Southwest, climate change is making extreme heat more intense and rainfall less reliable. The people in charge of managing local water supplies are taking note. ""Anybody here in the West that is not thinking about that, they're missing it,"" Renstrom said. ""Because we have to build an infrastructure now that's very adaptable to whatever happens.""

Fischer says we'd all better get used to it. The hotter, drying conditions that come with climate change are making these annual fires across North America, and in other parts of the world, the new norm.
""Wildfires are happening more frequently. They're getting bigger. They're emitting more smoke,"" Fischer says. ""The climate models are projecting that we're going to have more frequent, more severe wildfires.""
Climate
Some of Canada's wildfires likely made worse by human-driven climate change
Lori Daniels, a forest ecologist and professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who specializes in wildfire science, agrees. ""Smoke knows no political boundaries — and neither does fire,"" she says. ""The wind patterns have taken that smoke kind of from the northwest across a big diagonal. And that's why you're getting so much smoke down in the United States.""
Canada and the U.S. are seeing a
virtual repeat of 2023

""We are again having a remarkable start to fire season here in Canada,"" Daniels says. ""Like the U.S., we've been struggling with these really mega fires that have huge consequences for our ecosystems and for our human communities ... we're all struggling with this, not just in Canada and the United States, but worldwide.""

John Smol is a biology professor at Queen's University in Ontario who studies long-term environmental change. He says most people think forest fires are sparked by carelessness, such as a discarded cigarette. Not true, he says. Most are sparked by lightning. ""To have a big forest fire … you need fuel, you need a spark, and you need fuel that'll burn. If it's hot, dry, and you didn't have summer rains — and you get a lightning strike — that's it,"" he says.

Even for the people not driven from their homes, the effects of these fires can be harmful. According to the

People in the U.S. shouldn't be too quick to criticize Canada when it comes to wildfires, Daniels says. She notes that the worst air quality conditions ever measured in Vancouver, where she lives and works, were in 2020 — and that was due to
California wildfires that year.
Still, Daniels expresses sympathy to anyone in the U.S. who's being impacted. ""We're sorry about the smoke,"" she says."

Recent fixes to long-standing problems at the Federal Emergency Management Agency are in jeopardy as the Trump administration slashes programs and cuts staff, emergency experts warn.
FEMA has been plagued for decades by accusations that it fails to help the most vulnerable victims of disasters. Poor people, racial minorities and those who live in rural and tribal areas have been chronically ignored or denied crucial help after disasters, with long-term and even deadly consequences for families,
NPR investigations have found
.
Under the Biden administration, FEMA took
some concrete steps
to address those problems. For example, the agency simplified forms that disaster victims must fill out to apply for money, loosened requirements to prove residency and made some money for essential items like food and diapers available immediately.
Sponsor Message
Now, some of those efforts have been canceled, while others face an uncertain future. President Trump has repeatedly said that he believed FEMA should not exist in its current form. He has also moved to eliminate so-called equity programs meant to ensure that the federal government serves Americans from all economic, geographic and ethnic groups.
The agency has cut billions of dollars of programs and lost hundreds of staff. A recent White House budget request for FEMA included a significant increase in disaster relief funding, but a presidentially appointed FEMA review council is working on recommendations to pare down or eliminate the agency.
FEMA did not respond to questions from NPR about how it intends to help all Americans adequately after disasters, or whether reforms made under the Biden administration will be rolled back.
""There was a lot of headway being made,"" says Chauncia Willis-Johnson, the former emergency manager for Tampa, Fla., and the leader of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management. ""Now, not only have we stopped, but we've actually regressed.""
Baby steps for a plagued agency
Under the Biden administration, the goal at FEMA was to make sure every disaster victim got what they needed to recover and be protected against the next disaster, says then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. ""No two communities are alike, they all have different needs, and we can't apply a one-size-fits-all application of programs,"" she explains. ""And so that was the focus: equity.""
Sponsor Message
For example, imagine two different people, both struggling after a hurricane: The first is a parent who rented a now-damaged apartment in a city. The second is an elderly person who owns a damaged house in a rural area. One might need immediate cash to get food and diapers and pay for a hotel. The other might need in-person help filling out forms online or transportation to pick up crucial medication.
FEMA also brought in a high-level advocate for rural communities, and another one for tribal communities, to help the agency serve those populations better. And FEMA made it easier for people to prove where they lived, especially if they were living in a family home that had been passed down over many generations and no longer had a mortgage or a clear deed tied to the current occupants.
People who are staying with family members without a lease agreement, or who have inherited property informally, have
long struggled to get federal help
rebuilding after extreme weather, despite the fact that such families are less likely to have home insurance.
While the long-standing problems at FEMA were far from fixed at the end of the Biden administration, such equity policies were a step in the right direction, according to disaster experts.
""Was FEMA necessarily doing a good job? They weren't perfect,"" says Willis-Johnson. But ""there were a lot of positive movements made within the last five years.""
Donnie Speight's home in DeQuincy, La., was badly damaged by a hurricane in 2020. She struggled to get adequate assistance from FEMA, and spoke to NPR for an investigation that found the agency chronically ignored and failed to help those who needed it the most. Biden-era reforms meant to correct that pattern are now in jeopardy.

Serving those most in need
One of President Trump's first actions when he took office in January was to sign an executive order banning so-called diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government. That order led to the cancellation of at least one major disaster staffing program, known as FEMA Corps, which trained and deployed young people to help after disasters.
Earlier this spring, FEMA
also canceled
a major disaster preparedness grant program that had awarded tens of billions of dollars to help underserved rural communities prepare for floods, wildfires and other extreme events that are getting more common as the climate changes.
Sponsor Message
The program had also helped some small towns and tribal communities by providing technical aid in applying for highly sought after federal funds. ""We wanted them to have a fair shot at the funding that was out there,"" Criswell explains. Now,
that assistance is gone
.
Some equity efforts put into place at FEMA appear to still be intact. Last year, the agency made it easier for individuals and families to apply for money after disasters, by combining redundant forms and paying disaster survivors up to $750 to cover immediate needs such as food, water, medication and diapers. That assistance was expected to be
particularly helpful
for survivors who do not have a lot of money saved and who don't have homeowner's or renter's insurance.
Such efforts are a step in the right direction, says Manann Donoghoe, who studies disaster recovery at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research organization in Washington, D.C. ""Some individuals are more vulnerable than others, and we need a system that understands and reacts to that,"" he explains.
The importance of boots on the ground
Between the cancellation of FEMA Corps,
firing
of probationary employees and a raft of retirements and resignations
across the agency
, FEMA is grappling with a large number of staff vacancies going into the summer months, when hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other extreme weather get more common in the U.S.
That may mean fewer federally trained disaster responders on the ground than in past years and potentially less equitable aid distribution.
The profound importance of boots on the ground was made clear in 2020. After wildfires in Oregon destroyed thousands of homes, many of them in low-income rural parts of the state, FEMA denied about 70% of assistance applications, an
NPR investigation
found.
""I was talking to our team on the ground,"" remembers Criswell, who took over as FEMA's leader shortly after the wildfires. ""They were telling me how there [were] a large number of people that were denied assistance. But they could see there was enormous need.""
Sponsor Message
Criswell says FEMA workers called back everybody whose application had been denied and found that many people were actually eligible for money but had filled out forms incorrectly or incompletely. FEMA workers on the ground in Oregon ""were actually able to get a good percentage of them assistance just by taking the time to go over them with it,"" Criswell says.
It was an example of how important on-the-ground federal workers can be for victims of disasters, especially those who may not be proficient with a computer or able to fill out complex forms without help, says Criswell.
Willis-Johnson says expanding in-person assistance and knocking on doors after disasters was a crucial step in the right direction for an agency that has long failed to serve Black disaster survivors and other marginalized groups. ""FEMA was going into the underserved neighborhoods to make people aware of their options, and making them aware of the need to fill out post-disaster recovery assistance forms,"" Willis-Johnson says.
Now, she is worried that vulnerable people will struggle to get basic help after disasters. ""Why would we ever want people to suffer?"" she says. ""You shouldn't want that. It's not OK."""

SWANNANOA, N.C. — Before the

Hurricanes are dangerous far from the coast. Communities are struggling to prepare
Now, it's like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie, frozen in time. A thick layer of mud covers the area.
Kim Maisch points to a section of the motel that shifted and landed in the river. ""We are actually standing in the middle of where a foundation was for one of the hotel sections,"" she says. ""We are looking at rooms shifted off, cars open, mud, debris everywhere, insulation hanging from the ceilings. Room 222 was my dad's room.""

Last September, when
Tropical Storm Helene hit western North Carolina
, heavy rains forced rivers and tributaries out of their banks, causing the worst flooding seen in more than two centuries. The Swannanoa River swamped much of the town.

Maisch, 36, lives not far from the motel. She was up most of the night, watching the river rise and worrying about her father.
""I called him that morning and woke him up and asked him if he was okay,"" says Maisch. ""He didn't know exactly what was going on. He just knew that they were measuring and keeping an eye on the water. He stood [up] and there was water in his room. His trash can floated right by him, and that's when he had the National Guard knocking on his door.""

Climate change made Helene more dangerous. It also makes similar storms more likely
Everyone got out of the motel safely. Her father has since found another place to live. But most of the others living there still haven't.
Maisch, who used to clean Airbnb's before Helene, is now working with
Swannanoa Communities Together
. Local residents formed the group after the storm to focus on the area's greatest need — finding an affordable place to live. She's been helping residents put their lives back together with the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and private aid groups. But it's slow.
""I still see heartbreak and I do see a little bit of hope and not the hope that I would have thought during this whole process. It's still one day at a time, one breath at a time,"" Maisch says.

Maisch's home sits on higher ground across from the Super 8 Motel and sustained damage. ""We have to have our roof replaced,"" but she says she's not complaining. ""I still say minor damage compared to what's around us right now.""
Months after Helene, many still struggle
Eight months after the storm, evidence of Helene's destruction is everywhere in Swannanoa, Black Mountain, Asheville, and other communities throughout western North Carolina. In some places, it's as if the storm came through just last week. Buildings sit damaged, often tilted and off their foundations. Downed trees and piles of debris still wait to be cleared.

There are dozens of mobile home communities in Emma, a hilly wooded community west of Asheville. Emma didn't flood during Helene, but it did receive extensive storm damage.

Golden says the group was created several years ago as developers and national companies began targeting the community's mostly locally-owned mobile home parks. ""We started the organization to protect the affordable housing that exists here.""
Poder has helped residents form cooperatives that, in several cases, have been able to buy the land their homes sit on. Golden and her husband Abel Gonzalez, for example, bought the land their mobile home sits on via a cooperative. That allows them to build equity in their homes and create long-term stable communities.
Andrea Golden, co-director of Poder Emma, and Abel Gonzalez, her husband, have lived in a 1960s mobile home model for more than a decade. ""It's a beautiful home. It's an asset that I will leave to my three children. But I think there is something that is really real about the vulnerability that people face when they purchase their mobile home - you're a homeowner and you rent the land under it, you don't have that long-term security. Ownership of the land is an important conversation,"" she says.

In part because of Poder's work, Golden says local officials have begun to revise old views on mobile homes and the people who live in them. ""Local governments were trying to zone us out of mobile homes and mobile home parks for years,"" she says. ""Now, I think with the affordable housing crisis, the conversation has changed some. But I think there's a lot of myths and stereotypes about mobile homes.""
In communities where residents own the land, she says mobile homes can become permanent, long-term housing. But a lot depends on where they're located.
A community badly hit by Helene's inland flooding
In the town of Swannanoa, people drowned in communities near the river that were overwhelmed by Helene's flooding. It's left many former mobile home residents searching for stable, long-term housing.
Beth Trigg, with Swannanoa Communities Together, says some people went through the winter living in tents and sheds.
""To me, those are a symptom of the fact that the housing crisis is ongoing because it doesn't really work for most people to live in a ten-by-ten uninsulated structure,"" she says. ""It's one step up from a tent.""
Trigg and other activists working on the housing crisis are thankful to nonprofits and charities who have stepped in to do repairs and, in some cases, provide homes. But they are frustrated that local, state and federal governments are devoting so little attention to long-term housing needs.
Sponsor Message
""Policy tends to center around rebuilding roads and bridges, and small business loans, and many other things that are very important,"" says Trigg with frustration in her voice. ""And housing is kind of an afterthought. And for us, we think housing needs to be the first thing we think about. And then everything else needs to be centered around that.""
That's the case, Trigg says, especially in Swannanoa, one of the communities hardest hit by Helene. ""We experienced housing loss at a scale totally disproportionately to anywhere else in the region.""
Paulina Hernandez has lived in Swannanoa for about two decades. Before the storm, she and her husband used their savings to buy and rent out several mobile homes in a small community next to the river, Hourglass Way.
It's now an empty lot. ""There were nine mobile homes here. We own seven. And my son living here and my daughter living in the second one,"" says Hernandez. The couple rented out four.
The mobile homes were destroyed in the flood. With them went Hernandez and her husband's life savings. She becomes emotional looking at the bare foundations.
""Everything is gone, we don't have a house,"" Hernandez says, tears rolling down her cheeks. ""My son and my daughter, everybody is safe.""
That's the positive note Hernandez holds on to. Everyone got out safely, even a neighbor who refused to evacuate, but was later rescued from his rooftop. With the help of Swannanoa Communities Together, Hernandez and her family have found a temporary apartment.
But like many after Helene, she and her husband are searching for a long-term housing solution. Her dream? She says, if the landowner agrees, they hope to be back and rebuild their small mobile home community on Hourglass Way."

Storms bring rising flood risks
Even storms that don't turn into hurricanes can cause deadly floods, and experts say water-related hazards cause most deaths related to hurricanes that make landfall.
""We want people now to take the advantage of the opportunity to best prepare, both at the coast and then also well inland, where serious impacts from flooding and wind and tornadoes can occur as well as a tropical storm or hurricane moves inland,""
Jon Porter
, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, said in a video forecast on Friday.
Scientists say
climate change

further away from the coast
.
""Hurricanes can have significant inland impacts,"" Michael Brennan, director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, said at a press conference on Friday. ""It's important to get that message out to inland communities, especially in flood-prone areas, because that freshwater flooding has been such a significant source of fatalities in recent years.""
DOGE cuts threaten weather forecasting
As this year's hurricane season neared, the Trump administration targeted weather and climate research. It fired hundreds of NOAA employees and proposed
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding cuts
at the agency for 2026, including gutting climate research and slashing funds for satellites that provide critical data for weather forecasts.

Fired employees told NPR they fear the cuts will
undermine improvements in hurricane forecasting
, even as storms are getting more dangerous.
The National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA, has lost more than
500 workers
through the cuts by the Elon Musk-led
Department of Government Efficiency
and the departure of those who took the government's early retirement offer.
One of them is Brian LaMarre, who was a NWS meteorologist in the Tampa Bay area until he took early retirement in April.

""I don't think the current situation is sustainable,""
LaMarre told NPR's Scott Simon
on May 24. ""When you have 122 offices and many of them are short-staffed … that right there is a recipe for disaster when you look at the long-range forecast.""
In May,
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said
NOAA and the NWS were using ""the most advanced weather models and cutting-edge hurricane tracking systems to provide Americans with real-time storm forecasts and warnings."" He added: ""With these models and forecasting tools, we have never been more prepared for hurricane season."" NOAA is a part of the Department of Commerce.
""We're ready here, and that's what I can speak to is, directly, the readiness of us and our staff here at the National Hurricane Center,"" the NHC's Brennan said on Friday. ""We're ready to meet the needs of the [emergency management] community across the country as they come up this hurricane season, just as we always are.""
How many storms could the 2025 season bring?
NOAA says six to 10 of 2025's forecast storms are expected to become full-blown hurricanes — with winds of 74 mph or higher — and three to five could be major hurricanes, with winds of 111 mph or above.
That's in line with predictions from other forecasters, including at

After Helene's floods, North Carolina tries to tame trauma's lasting damage
In September, the Pacheos, who are in their early 60s, knew a big storm was coming, but they weren't too worried. Other tropical systems had flooded their creek before, but water had never come into their home. Jackie had hurt her knee and was on crutches, and had a cat she didn't want to leave. They settled in as Helene's rain came down.
""We were asleep, and I got an alarm on my phone,"" recalls Mrs. Pacheo.
The message? ""Evacuate now. Get out now,"" she says.
It was an emergency alert from Buncombe County sent to people who lived in low areas near rivers and tributaries that were beginning to flood.
""We grabbed what we could, and I tried to get my cat, but she wouldn't come with me because there was so much water out here already. So she perished in my house."" Mrs. Pacheo says.
Stuart and Jackie Pacheo lean out the window where they had to watch their own home carried off by the floodwaters of Tropical Storm Helene. Mrs. Pacheo and her husband escaped the flood at her mother's home, which was right next to their own.

Many along the

Easy to tell residents what's coming, but hard to get them to understand
In the eight months since the storm, Buncombe County official Lilian Govus has had time to think about why so many people stayed in their homes in low-lying areas.
Govus says it had been more than a century since the area had seen a flood like that. And people in the mountains pride themselves on being tough and resilient. In North Carolina, Govus says, nearly 80 people died from Helene's flooding, the majority of them in Buncombe County.
""And then also, we live in an area where we have nuisance flooding on a regular basis,"" says Govus. ""And so when we were saying rivers were going to crest at 20 feet, 23 feet, it was impossible to even put that into a scenario where people could apply it to their own personal lives.""

The deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, Jamie Rhome, says that's a phenomenon social scientists call ""localization of risk.""
""It's pretty easy, generally speaking, to convince people that something is coming. It's very hard to convince them something's going to happen bad at their house,"" Rhome says.
Two days before Helene hit the area, the National Hurricane Center issued an alert warning of ""catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding"" in western North Carolina. The hurricane center had also begun using a new forecast map, which highlighted in red the risk of flooding posed to the area.
Rhome says there are several reasons why freshwater flooding is now the leading cause of death in hurricanes. Because of climate change, the storms now are carrying more moisture, moving slower and dropping more rain.
""And they're moving more inland than they have in the past. And so that's striking parts of the country that might not be as aware of their risk,"" says Rhome.
In past decades, storm surge was the largest cause of death from hurricanes. While that's still a major concern, improved forecasting and widespread evacuations from coastal areas in the path of a hurricane have helped reduce those deaths. Rhome says ordering evacuations from inland flooding poses a greater challenge.
""For an area like western North Carolina, where do you evacuate them to?"" Rhome asks. ""Because it's very hard to drive out of the flood risk if it's a multi-state risk.""
There were hundreds of landslides in western North Carolina in Helene, which made evacuating
even more difficult
and dangerous.
Many residents of the areas hit hardest by Tropical Storm Helene, like Swannanoa, N.C., are still living in temporary housing. Some residents have moved into small sheds or trailers after their previous homes were destroyed by the floodwaters or fallen trees.

Ten of thousands of penguins, clustered together on the Antarctic Peninsula, can produce some potent stenches. Now, scientists have found that all that waste could be powerful enough to cool the climate.
The gases from penguin poop help fuel cloud formation, scientists found, which can change the temperature in the Antarctic. Clouds act like giant reflectors, blocking sunlight that would otherwise be heating the planet.
Scientists from the University of Helsinki observed this at a colony of 60,000 Adélie penguins. As the wind shifted in the direction of the researchers, a fog formed over the course of a few hours. Using highly sensitive equipment, they measured high levels of ammonia gas, leading to cloud formation, which could be happening all over Antarctica.
They published the findings in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.
Sponsor Message
The scientists say more research is needed to understand the overall effect on the climate, because while clouds reflect heat, they can also trap it under certain conditions. It's a key process to understand given the rapid changes at the farthest reaches of the world.
The poles are warming faster than the rest of the planet, as the climate gets hotter. That's altering the ecosystem for the penguins, as well as causing global impacts. Melting glaciers in Antarctica are causing sea levels to rise, posing a risk to millions of people around the world.
""It's quite interesting how such a small thing that you would never necessarily think about can have an impact on something else that's much bigger than itself,"" says Matthew Boyer, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Helsinki, who co-authored the study.
Gobs of guano
Penguins in Antarctica feast on fish and krill in the ocean and when they return to their nesting colonies, they leave behind the deposits of their digestive expeditions.
""It smells a bit like rotten fish mixed with pigeon poop,"" Boyer says. ""They don't smell great.""
Boyer and his colleagues analyzed the atmosphere and found ammonia gas around the penguin colony was 1,000 times higher than the normal background levels. In the air, that gas combines with other molecules.
Sponsor Message
""When they hit each other, they stick and these clusters of molecules end up growing,"" Boyer says. ""It's kick-starting or boosting this process and actually forming particles at a much faster rate than it would otherwise.""
Those particles become the seeds for clouds to form, because they attract water vapor. Clouds can only form when there are small particles around, like dust or pollution. And those clouds have a local impact.
""Clouds are important for climate because they're bright and they're white and they're in the sky,"" Boyer says. ""They can disturb incoming solar radiation and they reflect it back out to space.""
Antarctica has relatively fewer sources of particles to seed cloud formation, so researchers say even something like bird poop can have an influence.
Lauriane Quéléver
hide caption

Lauriane Quéléver
That effect is especially pronounced over the ocean, because without clouds, the dark surface of the ocean absorbs solar radiation and heats up. Boyer says more research is needed, though, because the effect of clouds can be mixed when they're over bright snow, since some can also trap heat at the surface.
Small poops, big impact
Other studies have found that seabirds in the Arctic could be producing a similar effect on the climate. Researchers measured and modeled the impact of bird guano there and found the clouds it produced
have an overall cooling effect
.
The reason something as lowly as bird poop can have an impact on the weather, the authors say, is that there aren't many other sources for cloud formation at the poles.
""There aren't a lot of existing particles in the Arctic,"" says Jeff Pierce, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who worked on the Arctic study. ""It's pretty clean. And small things, small details in these regions, such as the ammonia that comes off of poop, can make a difference in the number of particles.""
While penguins may be helping slow the impacts of climate change,
they're also affected by it.
Changing ocean conditions can affect krill, their food supply.
Sponsor Message
""If you lose one penguin species, it will have a ripple effect through the entire Antarctic environment and this could have subsequent impacts that really affect the climate and the atmosphere in ways that we're just beginning to understand,"" Boyer says.
The challenge for scientists is understanding this process in a rapidly shifting world.
""It's changing in our lifespan as we study it,"" Pierce says."

A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.
The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.
Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the
hottest day in Seattle's history
. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit,
according to the lawsuit
filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.
Sponsor Message
The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.
""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""
In
a rapid attribution study
released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""
A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""
Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.
Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already
face dozens of other climate lawsuits
filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.
Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge
recently dismissed
a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.
Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""
Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court
rejected an effort by oil and gas companies
to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices
turned down a request
by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the
Justice Department sued
Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.
Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.
""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person."""

LIMA, Peru — A Peruvian farmer and mountain guide has lost a landmark climate change lawsuit against one of Europe's largest power companies.
Saúl Luciano Lliuya
, who lives in a city in the central Ancash region, in the heart of the Andes, sued RWE, one of Europe's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, over the risk of flooding to his home from a glacial lake swollen by climate change. Although RWE has never operated in Peru, Luciano Lliuya argued the company's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers threatening his city.
But a court in Hamm, in northwestern Germany, ruled that the probability of the lake bursting its banks and devastating his home and the homes of some 50,000 other people in the area was too small for RWE to be held liable. It also barred him from appealing the verdict.
Sponsor Message
The ruling brings to an end a decade-long lawsuit in which Luciano Lliuya, supported by environmental group Germanwatch, had sought roughly $18,000 from RWE to pay for 0.5% of the cost of building a dyke to protect his home and the homes of his neighbors - the percentage equal to the proportion of RWA's total historic carbon emissions according to Germanwatch.
The company is now moving quickly into renewable energy and vows to become carbon neutral by 2040. But its power plants have been running on coal for
more than a century
.
Germanwatch warned that Lake Palcacocha had swollen to more than 30 times its historic volume and could overflow catastrophically in the event of an avalanche.
Ultimately, the court ruled that the probability of that happening was just over 1% in the next 30 years, below the threshold under German law for RWE to be found liable.
The German energy giant had argued that the issue of climate change should be resolved by governments and not in a court. In a statement after the verdict on Wednesday, RWE said a win against them would have had ""unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location, because ultimately claims could be asserted against any German company anywhere in the world for damage caused by climate change.""
Sponsor Message
This is just one of a
wave of climate litigation
cases against big industry and governments in recent years. Germanwatch is still claiming a win. It says that the court ruled on the specific risk of Lake Palcacocha bursting its banks. But, by allowing the case to proceed through the German court system for a decade, had accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs from around the world can use German property laws to sue German companies over their carbon emissions.
Petra Minnerop, an expert in international climate law at the United Kingdom's Durham University, who was not involved in the case, broadly backed Germanwatch's interpretation. ""It was only a factual question, not a legal one,"" she told NPR, meaning that the door remained open for similar litigation in Germany."

St. John
made national news
after an EPA tool called EJScreen revealed that the ""community had more cancer risk
than anywhere else in the nation from pollution
,"" according to Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at Tulane University's Environmental Law Clinic.
EJScreen helped academics, environmental justice advocates and regulators pinpoint which communities have been heavily impacted by pollution and climate change. The mapping tool allowed people to zero in on neighborhoods close to specific industries and compare levels of pollution and health impacts on top of numerous other data sets.

There are about 45 different hazardous air pollutants across parts of Louisiana's river parishes, including Ethylene Oxide and Chloroprene which the EPA classifies as carcinogens. A
2024 study by Johns Hopkins University
revealed much higher levels of Ethylene Oxide than previously reported.
""The cancer risk was typically on the order of 10 times higher than what is being modeled by the EPA tools,"" says the study's senior author Peter DeCarlo.
None of this surprises Taylor, who grew up in St. John.
"" My mother died of this rare cancer,"" Taylor says. ""My brother, my sister, my youngest sister, she's got a grandson, he's 35-years-old that's been diagnosed.""

Taylor says it shocked him the first time he heard the river parishes described as ""Cancer Alley."" This region is home to Black residents who have resided here for generations.

EJScreen was released to the public in 2015 under the Obama administration, but it received numerous updates under the Biden administration, including the incorporation of
socioeconomic and environmental indicators from the Census
and upgrading particulate matter 2.5 numbers with more recent EPA data. PM2.5 exposure is linked to heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and other diseases.
""It was really under President Biden that you saw the government really start to evolve towards being more equitable and more just,"" says Matthew Tejada, the former director at EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights under the Biden administration.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan met with communities disproportionately impacted by pollution, including Louisiana's river parishes on his Journey to Justice tour in 2023.
Tejada, who's now the Natural Resources Defense Council's senior vice president of environmental health, says money to address climate change and environmental harms flowed through the agency.
""We need to rethink entire systems for how we distribute benefits because they're not making it to the folks that deserve those benefits the most because they're the least protected,"" Tejada says.

Pushback on environmental justice
The Trump administration removed EJScreen in February after signing an executive order called ""Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.""
The EPA put nearly 200 employees who worked at the
Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on paid administrative
leave in February. Then the agency sent nearly 300 letters to staffers in the Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights office on April 28 warning they could be fired.
EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in an email these moves are ""organizational improvements"" that meet President Trump's executive orders and will ""ensure the EPA is best positioned to meet its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and powering the great American Comeback.""
Vaseliou also said that environmental justice has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of addressing specific environmental issues.
""When President Trump speaks about a Golden Age for America, that is for all Americans regardless of race, gender, creed, and background,"" she says. ""Under the Trump Administration, EPA is affirming our commitment to serve every American with equal dignity and respect.""
Andrea Issod, a senior attorney at Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program, says despite what the Trump administration says, the data is clear.
""They're exposed to hazardous waste, industrial pollution, and toxic emissions due to unfair policies like redlining and segregation,"" she says. ""So this problem the Biden administration set out to prioritize and we only made minor progress.""

But environmental advocates say that ""minor progress"" is quickly getting reversed, including a recent congressional rollback of a Biden-era rule that tightened emissions rules for some particularly dangerous pollutants.

The road ahead
Another petrochemical company, Formosa Plastics Group, plans to set up a complex that would house 14 petrochemical facilities in St. James. That's the unincorporated area about 30 minutes from St. John.
The air permits Formosa needed were vacated in 2022 after a judge ruled that the plastics company failed to show how the plant would impact air quality in an area that's around 90% Black. A Louisiana district court determined — with EJScreen data — that the plant ""violated"" the Clean Air Act.
However, a Louisiana appeals court overturned that decision in 2024. Now the Formosa project is moving forward. FG LA LLC, a subsidiary of Formosa, said in an email that it will uphold its commitment to operate safely and listen to community concerns.
""We are constructing this project with advanced emissions reduction mechanisms in place and extensive measures to protect the environment, and also plan to keep pace with technological advances that may enable the company to further strengthen those measures,"" said Janile Parks, a company spokesperson, in an email statement.
""As the project continues forward, FG will uphold its commitment to operate.""

But the process has dragged on so long that Kim Terrell with Tulane, says the air permits Formosa needs to operate have come up for renewal.
"" I think EJScreen sort of remains relevant to this case because pollution burdens have only increased over the last couple years, but now the public has one less tool than it had before for making their case,"" Terrell says.
Researchers, including those at the Environmental Data Governance Initiative,
helped archive EJScreen

filed a lawsuit against the federal government

Many of the families in the river parishes, she says, can trace their lineage back hundreds of years to this land. That's what keeps her and others motivated to fight for clean air and water. ""The fight is about democracy and equal justice under the law,"" LeBoeuf says."

The cost of homeowners insurance is soaring in states where large
outbreaks of tornadoes
are becoming more common. But it's hail — not tornadoes — that are the biggest concern for insurers in the middle of the country, according to industry experts and analysts.
Insurance companies have been raising their rates as the cost of extreme weather disasters grows. In Kentucky, where at least
19 people died
after a tornado tore through communities last week, premiums are up 35% from a few years ago,
according to the Consumer Federation of America
. It's a similar picture throughout the region. Rates are up 35% in Nebraska, 34% in Arkansas, 32% in Minnesota and 27% in Texas, Colorado and Iowa.

""Even though tornadoes are a much more significant threat to life, most of the insured damages associated with severe weather come from hail,"" says Scott St. George, head of weather and climate research at insurance broker WTW. ""And the reason for that is because tornadoes are awful and they're severe, but the footprint of those storms, the areas that are affected by them, is usually still pretty small.""
Hailstorms, on the other hand, cause damage across much larger areas. Hailstones, which can break windows,
tear off siding
and dent and
even puncture
roofing material, account for between half and 80% of homeowner insurance claims annually from severe convective storms — thunderstorms that can produce hail and tornadoes — according to St. George.
""My sense from the insurance industry is that hail has become an increasing contributor to claims in recent years due to frequency and severity,"" says Ben Keys, a real estate and finance professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And so that is driving insurers to respond by raising premiums.""
It's part of a trend that's happening across the country. Insurance premiums have risen 24% on average in recent years, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Insurers say they have to raise rates because disasters are getting more expensive. People continue to move to coastal regions vulnerable to hurricanes and to rural parts of the western U.S. that are prone to wildfires. That means more property is in harm's way. And when homes get damaged or destroyed, inflation has made it more expensive to rebuild.

'Insurers are going to follow the same playbook'
There's been an above-average number of tornadoes in the Midwest so far this year,
according to data collected by the National Weather Service
. That's not evidence of a long-term trend. But tornado patterns are changing in other ways.
For example, large tornado outbreaks, like the ones in
Kentucky and Missouri
last week, are becoming more common, though scientists aren't sure why. There's also some evidence that the timing of tornadoes in the U.S. might shift, with more forming in the fall and winter. That could be because warm, wet air is an ingredient for tornadoes, and those conditions are becoming more common at times of the year that used to be colder and drier.
As for hail, a team of scientists last year said that
as the Earth heats up
, storms
could produce larger hailstones
due to changes in the atmosphere.
""The public is more aware of the wildfires and hurricanes and so on, but I assure you, the insurance industry is very aware of the severe convective storms and tornadoes and associated hail,"" says David Marlett, managing director of the Brantley Risk & Insurance Center at Appalachian State University.
""Insurers are going to follow the same playbook"" they've used in response to other threats, Marlett says. ""They're going to scale back coverage primarily on the roofs"" — for example, by covering the value of a damaged roof rather than the cost of buying a new one — ""and they are going to attempt to increase rates to match the risk.""
In some states, homeowners can qualify for insurance discounts if they make their homes more resilient, including by installing fortified roofs. But the discounts are often relatively small, so the investments usually take a long time to pay off.
Sponsor Message
""For the average homeowner, buying a $15,000 roof versus getting an $80 drop in your insurance just isn't worth it for them,"" says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.
""When they're thinking about bills that they have to pay for that year or for that month or even that week, it just doesn't make sense for them financially to put on a new roof, because they're not thinking long term,"" Porter adds. ""They're thinking about the here and now and today.""
And while fortified roofs offer protection in hailstorms, tornadoes are a different story. Insurance experts say there's only so much stronger roofs and tougher building codes can do in the face of big tornadoes.
""At some point with a tornado, you simply can't build a structure that's going to withstand that,"" Marlett says."

PHILADELPHIA – Summer grilling usually starts with filling a propane tank or buying a bag of charcoal briquettes. But some people are ditching these fuels for a more climate-friendly electric grill.
Just before dinner recently, Stoio Kachev wheeled his electric grill across his family's backyard patio to an electrical outlet, plugged it in and hit the power button.
""You can choose what temperature you want,"" Kachev says, setting it to 500 degrees Fahrenheit on the digital display. ""So you see it's at 152 now and it'll take about 15 minutes to get to 500.""
On the menu are two family favorites. ""We are making some Bulgarian short ribs, and we're going to make some Vietnamese pork belly,"" says Doanh Nghiem. She and Kachev say convenience is the main reason they switched to an electric grill.

""We used to have a gas grill, and we used to go buy propane. Not only is it getting more expensive, but it's just a pain to lug [tanks] around,"" Nghiem says. ""I was sold when I learned that we could just plug it in and grill whenever we wanted to and not have to buy anything extra.""
Whether running an electric or propane grill is cheaper depends on utility rates and local propane prices, though if you don't have an outdoor outlet that might involve hiring an electrician.
Climate change is another reason Nghiem and Kachev switched. Before the grill, the couple replaced several fossil fuel items with electric ones — first their car, then lawn mower and trimmer, a water heater and last year the grill.
Switching from a fossil fuel-burning device to an electric one —
called electrification
— is a key climate solution, especially as they are powered by electricity generated from an
increasingly cleaner grid
that uses renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.

Penner says electric grills are popular with younger consumers and people who live in apartments that may not allow gas grills.
""You have a lot of empty nesters that also find it more convenient to simply plug into their outlet,"" Penner says, ""and 15 minutes later have a grill that's hot enough to cook on.""
Cooking vegetables also is easier with electric grills, he says. ""You're able to control the different parts of the grill and really control the temperature — vegetables and other products can be a little more sensitive sometimes.""
Because electric grills don't have flames, they also can be an option in places where forest fires are a risk, assuming there's an outdoor outlet available.
""Electric grills, like
Kenyon's lineup
, eliminate the risks associated with open flames, making them a wildfire-safe choice for outdoor cooking,"" says Mike Williams, vice president of sales and marketing for Connecticut-based Kenyon.
Both Kenyon and Current Backyard say their grills can withstand some exposure to water, such as a light rain.
Gas grills generally cost more to purchase. The highest rated gas grills at
Consumer Reports
, which doesn't rate electric grills, range from $275 to $2,750. Freestanding electric grill retail prices range from about
$200
to
$1,600
. For operating a grill, whether propane or electric is more expensive depends on your local utility rates and propane prices. Either way, the cost is nominal per meal — usually under $2.
Kenyon says its electric grill sales have increased more than 40% in the past three years. Current Backyard doesn't disclose sales, but the company is expanding its line with an electric griddle and pizza oven.
While the industry is optimistic about electric grills, some cooking experts are more skeptical about grilling without gas or charcoal.

""I think that there's a place for them,"" Taylor says, ""If you're just throwing [on the grill] burgers, dogs, very thin chicken cutlets — or things that cook quickly — I think electric is a dynamite, dynamite choice.""
But, putting his chef hat back on, Taylor offers a caveat: ""If you're not a purist like me, who must have wood or must have charcoal, or want those kind of flavors imparted in food.""
Taylor opens the refrigerator-size door to his Southern Pride Smoker, which cooks 400 pounds of meat at a time. ""If you bring your head closer, you can actually get a scent — a whiff — of what it is that we're doing with this barbecue,"" Taylor says.
""I put hickory and cherry in here,"" he says, pointing to the smoker's firebox. ""It automatically transfers over into the smoke chamber and stays there, constantly bathing our meats or barbecue or turkeys or ribs and all those items with that beautiful hickory and cherry smoke.""
You won't get that with an electric grill, Taylor contends, though some electric grills do offer a way to introduce wood smoke — usually with a tin of wood chips that burn as the food cooks. Professional chefs say there are a few other tricks for introducing traditional grilling and smoke flavors with an electric grill.
""I find that electric grills are all about the seasoning, not the seasoning on the item you are grilling, but the seasoning on the grill itself,"" says Rich Landau, chef and co-owner of
Vedge, a vegan restaurant in Philadelphia
. In an email responding to NPR's questions, Landau wrote, ""Clean it,
but not too much
. This helps create that deep layer of flavor on a grill.""

He suggests using lava rocks in the bottom of the grill because they ""are porous and absorb all of your grill drippings, they become seasoned as well, and each time you grill will give you more and more flavor.""
One thing electric grills can do better than most others is make picture-perfect grill marks.
Taylor says that's because an electric grill provides a more constant heat, ""where a fire will die down lower or you have to adjust the gas, the electric grill consistently is giving heat that makes it so that you can get those pretty grill marks.""
Back in Nghiem and Kachev's backyard, she's impressed with the grill marks on his short ribs. While an electric grill might not be up to a barbecue chef's high standards, for this couple, it's perfect for an evening meal in the backyard."

Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls the amount of toxic air pollutants emitted by many industrial facilities like oil refineries, chemical plants, and steel mills.
The decision represents the first time since the creation of the landmark environmental law that Congress has rolled back its environmental protections.
Environmental groups and public health advocates condemned the vote, saying the rollback could cause higher pollution and harm human health.
""What that will mean for Americans is more hazardous air pollution across the country,"" says John Walke, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.
Sponsor Message
""These are pollutants that cause cancer and birth defects and brain damage,"" Walke says.
The vote targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which re-imposed tight regulations on facilities that emit seven so-called ""super pollutants"" like mercury, a dangerous form of lead, and dioxins. The rules regulating those seven pollutants, along with more than 180 others, were first imposed in the 1990s, but were rolled back during the first Trump administration.
The House approved the resolution early Thursday morning, following a Senate vote in favor of changing the rule earlier this month. The vote in the House and Senate was split along party lines, except for one House Republican who joined Democrats in voting against the resolution.
Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can review EPA regulations within a short window after their implementation and reverse them with a simple majority vote. President Trump has signaled he is likely to sign the bill when it arrives on his desk.
The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental and public health regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March that he intends to re-evaluate other regulations like the one Congress just voted to change
,
which is related to a section of the Clean Air Act that deals with Hazardous Air Pollutants.
Sponsor Message
The agency, Zeldin says, is embarking on the ""
biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history
,"" which he says is meant to lower the cost of operating businesses in the U.S. while fulfilling the agency's core mission of protecting the environment. Zeldin also aims to target other parts of the Clean Air Act, like the rules regulating mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers welcomed Congress's decision. In a December open letter to president-elect Trump, the group had called for a review of EPA's rules regarding
hazardous air pollutants
, calling them ""technically unachievable and economically infeasible.""
""By eliminating the misguided ""Once-in, Always-in"" rule, we can reduce compliance costs for manufacturers while incentivizing better environmental outcomes,"" says Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at NAM.
But environmental and public health experts warn the change could result in higher pollution levels in communities that neighbor industrial facilities like ""oil refineries, chemical plants, coke ovens, aluminum plants, lead smelters, things of that nature. We call it the worst of the worst list,"" says Walke. The facilities are largely concentrated in parts of the country with high industrial activity, like the
Gulf Coast and parts of Appalachia
.
""Once in, always in""
The rule concerns the regulation of seven particularly hazardous air pollutants like dioxins and mercury. Such pollutants move through the air but also accumulate in soil, dust, and people's bodies; several are
known to cause cancer
,
neurological issues, and birth defects
even at very low exposure levels.
Rules regulating those seven air toxic pollutants, along with more than 180 others, have been in place since 1990 when Congress passed a major amendment to the Clean Air Act that greatly increased its specific regulatory powers. It tasked EPA with tightly regulating what it called ""major sources"" of dangerous air pollutants—facilities that emitted more than 25 tons (50,000 pounds) of the hazardous pollutants a year, or 10 tons of any single one. Facilities that emitted less pollution, called ""area sources,"" would be much more lightly controlled.
Sponsor Message
The regulation Congress targeted concerns which facilities count as ""major sources.""
Since the 1990s, EPA's policy has stipulated that any ""major source"" would remain categorized as such, even if it cut pollution levels to below the certain thresholds—a policy known as ""Once in, always in."" The policy intended to keep toxic air pollution levels not just lower, but as low as possible.
But under the first Trump administration, the EPA allowed major sources to re-categorize if they had reduced their dangerous emissions. Last year, the EPA under Biden undid part of that change, once again expanding the number of facilities covered.
Since the rule change is relatively recent, Republicans in Congress could now challenge it using the Congressional Review Act. The result would be a more durable change to the law. Under the rules of the CRA, ""EPA can no longer do a similar rule or a rule that is substantially similar,"" says Carrie Jenks, an environmental law expert at Harvard University. To revisit the HAP rule once again, EPA would have to come up with a new, different argument for why to keep major sources classified as major.
The advocacy group EarthJustice estimated that the change would allow roughly 1,800 industrial facilities, like steel mills or chemical factories, to apply to be taken off the ""major sources"" list.
Pollution risks
Exposure to even small levels of the seven super-toxins is so dangerous, say environmental and public health experts, that releasing major sources from the strict regulations and controls under the ""major sources"" framework could lead to higher levels of pollution exposure in nearby communities.
""Picture some of the communities in the industrial Midwest, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio or along the Gulf in Texas and Louisiana,"" where there are many emitters of toxic air pollutants concentrated in one area, says former Biden-era assistant EPA administrator Joseph Goffman.
Sponsor Message
Even if each of them were below their individual emissions limit, the total amount of pollution in the air nearby would be high, he explains. The more stringent regulations, he says, help to keep that total amount of pollution low — and safer for people nearby.
Ultimately, what matters to human health is not how much each facility emits but how much is released altogether in a specific region, Goffman says — and the EPA's more strict regulations intended to keep that overall level low.
""It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution,"" he says."

An above-average number of storms are expected during this year's Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warn. Tens of millions of people live in areas at risk for dangerous hurricane-related wind damage, storm surge and flooding from heavy rain.
Forecasters
expect 13 to 19 storms
to form in the Atlantic between June 1 and November 30. That is slightly higher than the average of 14 storms that usually occur over the course of a hurricane season. Five of the last 6 years have had an above-average number of storms.
Of those storms, 6 are expected to be full-blown hurricanes, and between 3 and 5 of those are forecast to be major hurricanes. Major hurricanes have
winds powerful enough
to topple trees, damage roofs and destroy mobile homes. The rest are forecast to be weaker tropical storms, which nonetheless have the potential to cause deadly flooding far from the coastline.

""Everything's in place for an above-average season,"" said Ken Graham, the director of the National Weather Service, which oversees the National Hurricane Center, at an event to announce the forecast.
Not all hurricanes that form over the ocean make landfall. But those that do, together, kill dozens of people on average each year in the U.S., and most of those deaths are from flooding, storm surge and other water-related hazards.
""Water's the biggest killer with these things,"" Graham said. ""I've seen so many cases where the inland flooding causes more fatalities than on the coast."" Last year,
Hurricane Helene killed more than 200 people
after it came ashore in Florida and barreled up into Georgia, North Carolina and parts of Appalachia, dumping catastrophic amounts of rain and washing away entire neighborhoods.
In 2022, catastrophic storm surge from
Hurricane Ian caused more than $100 billion
in damage in Florida and killed more than 150 people. And relatively weak storms in 2017 and 2018 also caused massive flood damage, including hundreds of miles inland.
Climate change means new hurricane threats
Climate change
makes powerful storms more common

are the main reason forecasters expect an above-average number of storms this year, Graham said.
And a warmer atmosphere can also
hold more moisture
, which can lead to catastrophic flooding from heavy rain.
""We are seeing heavier rainfall,"" said Graham. ""We're hearing from more and more communities that's like 'Wow, I've lived here my whole life. I've never seen rainfall rates like that.""
FEMA was not present at the annual hurricane forecast announcement
Usually, top federal emergency officials attend the hurricane forecast announcement in May. A high-ranking official from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been on hand at every hurricane outlook briefing for at least the last decade, to share tips about how members of the public should prepare for hurricane season.
But no official from FEMA spoke at today's announcement, which was held in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, not far from where Hurricane Katrina made landfall nearly 20 years ago. FEMA did not respond to questions from NPR about the agency's absence from the event.
""That's very alarming that you don't have the nation's leading emergency management agency telling people that they should be taking the steps now to prepare,"" says Jeremy Edwards, a former FEMA spokesperson who previously attended hurricane forecast announcements in that role. ""I'm personally a little perplexed about why you wouldn't take those opportunities. It costs you nothing to try to help people get prepared. It costs you nothing to try to help save lives.""
Instead, weather officials shared a variety of preparedness advice, including to review your evacuation plan if you live on the coast, understand whether local rivers are likely to flood, look into getting flood insurance and make sure to use electrical generators in safe ways.

""The best way to thrive during a disaster is by making critical decisions beforehand,"" said Cynthia Lee-Sheg, the president of Jefferson Parish.
In the past, FEMA officials have also exhorted people who live in hurricane-prone areas to make a detailed evacuation plan that included what they would do with pets, how they would bring medical devices and medications, and how they might help elderly or disabled loved ones get to safety.
For those who live in inland areas, in the past FEMA officials have recommended making a plan for sheltering in place without electricity. Each year, people in the U.S. die in the days after hurricanes, when electricity and water are disrupted and roads are swept away or blocked by debris, making it impossible for emergency vehicles to get through.
President Trump has said that FEMA, as it currently exists,
should be eliminated
, and has appointed a council responsible for recommending changes to the agency. The Trump administration
abruptly replaced the acting head of FEMA
with just weeks to go before the beginning of hurricane season, and replaced him with a Department of Homeland Security official with no emergency management experience.
In response to allegations that FEMA is not prepared for hurricane season, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this week that the new FEMA leaders ""have been actively engaged in making sure that we are pre-deploying resources, staff, equipment out in anticipation of hurricane season,"" and ""making sure that we are adequately prepared for this season ahead of us."""

Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit alleging a state law that regulates air-pollution monitoring violates their constitutional rights.
Private organizations have been using low-cost air sensors to detect toxic pollution from the state's refineries and chemical plants. The testing, some of which has been
funded by the Environmental Protection Agency
, serves as a critical line of defense, environmental and public health advocates say, especially for residents of an industrial corridor in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley. Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.
Sponsor Message
Last year, Louisiana lawmakers
put new requirements
on those community testing activities. The law says that for community groups to allege violations of environmental rules, they have to use federally-approved monitoring equipment, and it sets restrictions for analyzing and sharing the data.
Several community groups
said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court
on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.
""This is just an obvious attempt to keep citizen groups from doing any monitoring,"" says David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and the director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which helps frontline communities push for tough environmental standards.
""The impact has been muzzling — groups either stopping doing monitoring, not starting to do monitoring that they wanted to do or no longer publishing results,"" Bookbinder says.
The community groups' free-speech claims are based on Louisiana's alleged restrictions on ""publicly discussing, advocating for cleanup action, or warning people about potentially dangerous air pollution"" when it's detected using air monitors that don't meet federal standards, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.
Jo Banner, co-director of
The Descendants Project,
one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, says the new law has made it harder to take action against polluters.
Sponsor Message
""We are prepared to just keep moving forward with the work that we've been doing and trying our best to communicate that to the public,"" Banner says. She adds, ""If we have [data] that is alarming, our community needs to know for their own safety.""
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she'll fight the lawsuit. ""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.
The state's Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment on pending litigation. The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Eddie Lambert, didn't respond to messages seeking comment.
The air-monitoring law, which had bipartisan support, says the intent is to ensure the public gets ""accurate air quality information.""
David Cresson, chief executive of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement that the air-monitoring law doesn't prevent community groups from collecting or sharing data. ""What this law clarifies is that if air monitoring data is going to be used to trigger regulatory enforcement, penalties, or as the sole source for a lawsuit, it must meet the same EPA-approved standards already required of industry and government agencies,"" Cresson said.
Critics say ambiguities in the law are part of the problem
George Wyeth, a visiting scholar at the Environmental Law Institute, says the law is still concerning. For example, if community groups detect high levels of certain pollutants in their area and suggest there's been an environmental violation, it's unclear if that would break the new law. It's also unclear, Wyeth says, what groups have to do when they analyze and communicate air-pollution data to comply with the law.
""If I were a community member, I wouldn't know what some of these [requirements] meant, and I would probably just stay away from it,"" says Wyeth, a former EPA lawyer who isn't involved in the lawsuit.

Kentucky
recently enacted
a law that's similar to Louisiana's.
Those laws were passed following several years during which community groups conducted more air monitoring as lower-cost testing equipment became widely available, says Jay Benforado, board chair of the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, which isn't involved in the Louisiana lawsuit.
However, Benforado says it's unclear if there's an actual problem that needs solving by passing laws like those in Louisiana and Kentucky. ""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case? And we haven't come across any examples,"" he says.
Banner of The Descendants Project says the Louisiana law effectively labels groups like hers as ""troublemakers.""
""If you want to see bipartisan cooperation, you should look to Louisiana and the way that we invite industry to come in, and the dangers that communities face,"" Banner says. ""And both sides, all sides, support this.""
Democratic state lawmakers who represent Banner's district didn't respond to a message seeking comment.
""It is the job of our regulatory agencies to protect us, to protect our air, to protect our health. And if that standard is not being met and people are going out to do it by themselves, that seems to be indicating that there's a problem at that first step,"" says Peter DeCarlo, an atmospheric chemist at Johns Hopkins University who has studied air pollution in Louisiana.
DeCarlo was part of a team of researchers that
found the toxic gas ethylene oxide
in parts of Louisiana at levels that were significantly higher than EPA estimates for the region. That suggests residents there face much greater cancer risks than previously thought, DeCarlo says.
""Now, there's retaliation against community groups for going out and trying to figure out what's going on in their air,"" DeCarlo says, ""and if they're being impacted, and how they're being impacted."""

The Senate has overruled the guidance of the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets the Senate's rules, and voted 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards for cars that are stricter than national regulations. The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian
a handful of times
in the 90-year history of the role.
The Senate also voted to revoke two waivers related to heavy-duty trucks. One allowed California to mandate zero-emission trucks, and the other permitted stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks.
Congress is using a law called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, as a mechanism to revoke the federal waivers that allowed California to set these rules. The House previously
approved
three resolutions to revoke the waivers.
Sponsor Message
But there are significant questions about whether this use of the CRA is legal; the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, who serve as referees within the federal government,
both determined
that it
is not
.
The GAO's opinion is merely
advisory
. The parliamentarian's guidance is also non-binding, but the Senate has traditionally followed it. While disregarding this advice is not
unprecedented
, it's extremely rare. Historically, leaders of both parties have feared that if they act unilaterally to change the Senate's norms, the other party will do the same when they're in power. That's
exactly what happened
in 2013 and 2017, when first Democrats and then Republicans
deployed the ""nuclear option""
to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees.
Politics
Senate Pulls 'Nuclear' Trigger To Ease Gorsuch Confirmation
""Today it's all about California emission waivers. But tomorrow, the CRA could now be used to erase any policy from an agency that the Trump administration doesn't like at a simple majority threshold,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday evening as he tried unsuccessfully to derail the vote. He argued that the CRA could subsequently be used to repeal any policies the White House — including future administrations — doesn't support, including waivers related to Medicaid or reproductive health care. ""Republicans should tread carefully today,"" he said. ""What goes around comes around.""
Sponsor Message
Republicans have embraced a legal argument that the CRA
can be used in this case
. Speaking Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that Republicans were not changing the Senate's broader rules or norms, and suggested other reasons for Democratic opposition. ""I think a lot of Democrats support an electric vehicle mandate,"" he said. ""In fact I think they're somewhat frantic at the prospect of losing this 'Green New Deal' policy.""
California Attorney General Rob Bonta says this use of the CRA is unlawful
,
and that California will challenge it in court. ""The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California's waivers is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California's efforts to protect the public and the planet from harmful pollution,"" Bonta wrote in a statement.
Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom framed the vote as a national economic issue, arguing that rolling back the standards risks
ceding the global EV market to China
, where EVs make up a much higher share of production than in the U.S. ""The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for. Will you side with China or America?"" he wrote in a
statement
.
A unique ability
Because of its long history of regulating vehicle emissions, California has the unique ability to establish rules that are more ambitious than the federal ones. Each rule requires a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other states can choose to follow California's stricter standards if they want.
California has used this ability to push the auto industry toward zero-emission vehicles for many years, both to protect human health and to reduce the transportation industry's contributions to climate change.

In the first Trump administration, the
EPA withdrew a waiver
that allowed California to set vehicle standards. A legal battle ensued. Some carmakers sided with the White House and others with Sacramento in the fight over whether that was legal. But the battle became moot after the Biden administration reinstated the waiver.
Environment
Trump Says California's Ability To Set Its Own Emissions Standards Will Be Revoked
Since then, California's mandates have become more aggressive, requiring a rapid acceleration in electric vehicle production, starting with 35% of new sales within the state in model year 2026 and reaching 100% of new sales by 2035.
Critics have called that goal unrealistic, given that currently EVs make up about a quarter of new car sales in California, and about 10% of sales nationally. Supporters say that the rules are flexible enough to make them more achievable than they seem.
Supporters also say that the state's standards are more important, the weaker federal rules get — especially with the Trump administration now
poised to roll back federal environmental regulations
, including on emissions standards
.
Climate
EPA announces dozens of environmental regulations it plans to target
In April, more than 100 public health and environmental groups sent
a letter to Congress
saying that blocking the California standards would mean ""more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.""
The use of the CRA to revoke the waiver is new; last time, Congress wasn't involved and the executive branch withdrew the waiver on its own. But just like during the first Trump administration, expect this decision to trigger a legal battle. Bonta, the California attorney general, has vowed to sue.
Industry allied against the regulations
President Trump campaigned against ""EV mandates"" and ""gas car bans"" that would require gas cars to be replaced with electric ones. And while federal EV rules are
not technically mandates
, California's
more aggressive rules
do
directly require companies to stop selling new gas vehicles (unless they can also run on electricity, like plug-in hybrids do).
Sponsor Message
The Trump administration has powerful allies in its fight against these rules. The oil industry has repeatedly sued to challenge California's stricter rules. The agriculture lobby, which favors biofuels over batteries, also opposes the California waiver. A group of more than 100 energy, agriculture and transportation trade groups issued
a letter
in mid-March urging Congress to disapprove the California waivers, arguing the three California rules would ""harm American economic and national security"" by increasing reliance on
battery supply chains that are dominated by China
.
U.S. vs. China: Inside a great power rivalry
The great battery race: China and the U.S. compete over the future of EVs
The American Petroleum Institute has argued that electric vehicle mandates reduce consumer choice and raise the up-front costs of vehicles. In legal filings and public comments, the group also emphasizes it would cost the oil industry enormously.
""[An EV] mandate would produce widespread effects on the national economy, such as the reduced need for oil and gas production and gas processing, and changes to petroleum refining and distribution,"" the group wrote in one set of
comments
in 2024, describing the changes required to meet California's rules as ""extraordinary.""
Automakers have also opposed the rule, although the issue is more complicated for the auto industry than for the oil industry. Carmakers would like some regulatory stability, since they need to plan vehicle production years in advance. In the name of stability, some automakers
previously volunteered
to keep following some California regulations during the first Trump administration, when they were disputed.
On the other hand, many traditional automakers think that California's current rules are unrealistic, particularly for the dozen or so states that have opted in to follow those standards. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the major automaker trade group,
says it would take a ""miracle""
to meet the rules, because demand for EVs is not as strong as California had hoped.
The auto industry has been lobbying California, and each of the states following its rules, to slow down, pause or soften their strict EV requirements, with
some success
. But carmakers have simultaneously been lobbying for the use of the CRA to eliminate the California rule altogether, and knock out all those state requirements at once — precisely what's happening now.

The Zero Emission Transportation Association, which represents electric automakers, called the waiver repeal ""an extraordinary action that sets a dangerous precedent.""
Industry groups are celebrating. The American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers dubbed the repeal of that waiver ""a massive win for consumers and working families all across the country.""
""The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,"" the automaker trade group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement, saying Congress deserves ""enormous credit"" for repealing California's rules."

There have been a lot of tornadoes so far this year. Recent tornadoes
killed dozens of people
in Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia. Earlier this spring, deadly tornadoes tore across eight midwestern states.
An above-average number of tornadoes in the Midwest have occurred so far this year, according to
data collected by the National Weather Service
. Usually, by this time in May, a little over 600 tornadoes have been reported in the U.S. This year, it's more than 850 tornadoes.
But that isn't evidence of a long-term trend. ""There's not really an increase or a decrease in the overall number of tornadoes that we see,"" says Melissa Widhalm, the associate director of the Midwestern Regional Climate Center at Purdue University. ""That number's been pretty stable,"" going back to the 1950s or so.
Sponsor Message
However, tornado patterns in the U.S. are changing in other ways. Big outbreaks of tornadoes, like the ones in Kentucky and Missouri over the weekend when lots of storms move across a large area in a short period of time, are getting more common.
""In the past we didn't see the kind of large outbreak days that we do now,"" Widhalm explains. ""It used to be kind of unusual to see dozens of them in a day. And now we get that year after year.""
She points out that warning people about large tornado outbreaks is labor-intensive, because it requires lots of highly skilled weather forecasters who can use radar data to track storms as they move across entire states and regions. Publishing warnings for one tornado is already complex, and publishing warnings for multiple tornadoes at once over a large area is even more challenging because it requires coordination between forecasters in multiple locations and data from multiple radar instruments.
The increase in large tornado outbreaks is particularly notable as the
Trump administration is moving to dramatically cut the budget
of the National Weather Service, and weather service offices have many vacant positions that are going unfilled because of a federal hiring freeze.
Sponsor Message
During the recent deadly tornado outbreak in Kentucky, the
local weather service office in Jackson, Ky
., had to borrow forecasters from other offices in the region, because they didn't have enough staff, according to a statement from the National Weather Service.
""As planned in advance, neighboring offices provided staffing support to the office in Jackson, KY.,"" the statement says. ""Additionally, the Jackson office remained fully staffed through the duration of the event using surge staffing.""
Tornado researchers are still trying to understand why some tornado patterns are changing in the U.S., and what the future could hold.
It's
unclear how climate change
might affect tornadoes. There's some evidence that the timing of tornadoes in the U.S. might shift, so there are more tornadoes in the fall and winter months. One reason that might happen as the Earth heats up is that moist, warm air is one necessary ingredient for tornadoes to form, and those conditions are getting more likely during times of year that used to be colder and drier.
But, so far, scientists can't say for sure whether that trend will play out, or whether climate change might affect tornadoes in the U.S. in other ways."

You're about to walk your dog, but the sky looks ominous. You pull out your phone, open your favorite weather app, and see that it's about to pour. You wait for the rain to pass.
Or maybe you planned a summer vacation at the beach. A week before you're supposed to leave, you hear a weather alert on the radio in your car. There's a hurricane headed toward the coast. You have plenty of time to make new plans — and spend your vacation out of harm's way.
Millions of Americans rely on weather forecasts every day. And accurate weather forecasts have never been easier to access. Hourly outlooks and severe weather warnings are available on smartphone apps and weather websites, TV and radio broadcasts and in newspapers.
Sponsor Message
But how are these forecasts made? Where does the underlying information come from?
We break it down, and explain how some of that weather information might be interrupted this year.
Weather forecast Step 1: Make lots of measurements
Basic measurements about the weather are the fuel for accurate forecasts. That includes information about how fast and in what direction the wind is blowing, where it is raining or snowing and how much precipitation is falling, what the barometric pressure is and whether there are clouds.
And accurate weather forecasts require data from all over the world, says Alex Lamers, Forecast Operations Branch chief for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center. ""Weather happens in the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is connected globally. It doesn't happen in isolation over one specific location,"" he explains.
One of the most powerful ways to collect global data about the weather is through satellites and Doppler radar towers.

Satellites offer big-picture information. For example, weather satellites can track hurricanes as they move across the ocean, and wildfire smoke as it spreads across large swaths of land. Weather satellites also measure lightning activity, cloud cover, the temperature of the ocean surface and humidity in the atmosphere.
Sponsor Message
The U.S. government, through NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), operates multiple weather satellites and makes all the data they collect available to the public for free. Private weather forecasting companies, like the ones that operate weather websites and smartphone weather apps, use that data to inform their weather forecasts.
""Whatever weather app you might have on your phone, the view of clouds and precipitation from Doppler radar, that's probably NOAA data,"" Lamers says.
A NOAA weather satellite known as GOES-17 is prepared for launch in 2018. The satellite continuously measures weather conditions for an area that includes the West Coast of the United States.

The National Weather Service also operates more than 150 Doppler radar towers across the country and shares the data with the public for free. Like satellites, Doppler radar collects big-picture information about rain, snow, sleet and hail, wind speed and direction and the clouds associated with thunderstorms. It can also detect debris in the air from tornadoes, which is very helpful for tracking where a tornado is and where it's going.
Having continuous information from radar and satellites is crucial during storms, including severe thunderstorms, tornado outbreaks and atmospheric rivers, Lamers explains. ""That's really important for us to monitor storms as they develop,"" he says, ""[to] be able to monitor the current state of the storm, where the most intense parts are, and be able to monitor that around the clock.""
In
an open letter in May
, all five living former weather service directors expressed concern that those radar installations could be impacted by the Trump administration's federal hiring freeze and budget cuts, because radar instruments require maintenance by highly skilled technicians and there are many vacant positions.
The proposed White House budget would
slash funding for NOAA
by about a third and virtually eliminate weather research, ocean observations and work on new satellites.
A truck-mounted radar instrument called the Doppler On Wheels near Amanda Park, Wash. Scientists at NASA and the University of Washington used the radar instrument to validate satellite measurements of rain and snow. Permanent Doppler radar installations across the country, operated by NOAA, provide crucial real-time measurements about precipitation, tornado debris and hail.

Many of those measurements happen at automated weather stations. NOAA runs about 900 weather stations all over the country. You might have seen one at an airport or next to a government building. One of the most obvious instruments is a rotating wheel with little cups on the end that measures wind speed.
Sponsor Message
Ocean information is also important because a lot of dangerous weather systems, including hurricanes and atmospheric rivers, form over the ocean before they affect the U.S.
But operating weather-monitoring instruments in the ocean takes a lot of work, because the conditions on the open sea are so harsh. The federal government maintains
about 200 ocean buoys
, as well as gliders and other instruments that can measure what's happening below the surface of the ocean. Research ships, military vessels and some cargo ships also contribute weather data for the public.
""Obviously we cannot cover the entire globe, the entire surface of the Earth, with all these instruments, so we have to be smart,"" says Vijay Tallapragada, a weather modeling expert for NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center. For example, weather sensors are strategically located in parts of the ocean where severe weather is more likely to form.
A NOAA ocean buoy is deployed in the Pacific Ocean in 2022. Ocean buoys measure wind, water temperature and other conditions on the open ocean. Because many weather systems form over the water, such data is important for accurate weather forecasts for the U.S.

The last, and arguably most crucial, piece of the puzzle is information about the atmosphere. Every day, employees at the National Weather Service launch weather balloons with sensors attached to them. Until recently, that was happening at least twice a day at 90 locations across the country, and more often in places that were expecting severe weather such as tornadoes.
But multiple National Weather Service offices have
cut back on balloon launches
this spring because of staffing shortages. The Trump administration has moved to lay off hundreds of weather workers and left hundreds of other critical forecasting positions vacant after workers retired.
The weather service addressed such disruptions in a written statement. ""The National Weather Service is adjusting some services due to temporary staffing changes at our local forecast offices throughout the country in order to best meet the needs of the public, our partners and stakeholders in each office's local area,"" the statement says. ""These adjustments are also temporary and we will continue to fulfill our core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warnings, and decision support services.""
Sponsor Message
Tallapragada says balloon data, and other aerial measurements from planes, are the single most impactful source of data for weather forecasting computer models. In addition to providing real-time information about what's happening in the atmosphere, forecasters rely on balloon measurements to calibrate satellite data. So, without balloon measurements, satellite measurements are less useful.
""We definitely know that aircraft measurements and balloon data have the largest impact on the forecasts,"" Tallapragada explains.
A National Weather Service weather balloon launches in Bismarck, N.D., in June 2017. Weather balloons go up more than 5 miles into the atmosphere and transmit measurements back to the ground continuously as they fly.

Weather forecast Step 2: Put all the data into a weather supercomputer
A weather forecast is
basically the solution to a really complicated math problem
. Supercomputers can solve that problem. They take all the information about what's going on in the atmosphere and oceans and use it to predict and track weather that will happen in the coming weeks.
The supercomputers doing this task for the U.S. are run by NOAA.
Those computers run multiple weather models, tailored to different types of weather. For example, hurricane models to predict when and where hurricanes will hit land, and how damaging they will be when they arrive.
Developing and running the computer models is quite labor-intensive, Tallapragada explains. ""Each of these models require continuous improvement and maintenance,"" he says.
The incoming weather information changes all the time. Instruments on buoys and planes are replaced or recalibrated. Old satellites are decommissioned and new ones are launched. Private companies and weather services for other nations agree to share data, or change which data they're providing. Every little change must be accounted for in the computer models.
""So we need people to process, understand, calibrate and characterize those datasets so they can be assembled and used in a meaningful way,"" Tallapragada says.

Weather forecast Step 3: Translate the forecast from computer-speak to human-speak
The supercomputer is great at math, but it's not great at communicating with humans. When it is done crunching the numbers, it spits out a forecast result that's still mostly math.
Sponsor Message
Human forecasters then have to interpret the result and translate it into an actual weather forecast. For example, a string of numbers and probabilities becomes a map showing how much rain is expected to fall over a certain area in the next three days, and what the temperature will be each hour.
That work is done by professional weather forecasters, including meteorologists at more than 100
National Weather Service offices
around the country. Local National Weather Service offices provide free, detailed local forecasts every few hours.
Meteorologists at private companies, including those who work for TV, radio and newspaper outlets, also rely on public weather model information to inform their local weather forecasts.
And if there's severe weather headed your way, like a hurricane, heavy rainstorm or tornado, the local National Weather Service office will put out a warning. That warning automatically shows up and makes an alarm sound on all the smartphones in the area. Warnings also play on the radio and on local television news stations, and they show up on weather apps and websites.
In their
open letter
this spring, former weather service directors warned that severe staffing shortages at local weather service offices could lead to less accurate and detailed forecasts this summer.
""Work is underway to restore services at local forecast offices around the country,"" according to a statement from the National Weather Service.
The summer and fall months are a busy time of year for severe weather in the U.S., from heat waves and hurricanes to heavy downpours and hailstorms. And climate change is causing dangerous weather to get more common."

VIENNA – Vienna's city hall, with its stone towers and gargoyles, often reminds visitors of another neo-gothic building, says city council member Nina Abrahamczik.

Vienna takes its job as a climate role model seriously. In addition to mandating solar panels and energy-efficient buildings, Vienna is now heating thousands of homes with geothermal energy instead of
planet-heating natural gas
. It's building massive heat pumps. It's investing in new infrastructure to help adapt to heat waves and floods. And this spring Vienna passed a historic climate law, outlining a plan to get its climate pollution down to zero by 2040.

Gernot Wagner
, Columbia University climate economist and an advisor for Vienna's Mayoral Advisory council. Austria's newly elected federal government is deprioritizing climate action, Wagner says. In the new coalition government, the ecological Green Party is out, and conservatives, who are less interested in climate action, have gained power. ""At the federal level things are taking a step back, climate is taking a back seat,"" he says.
Meanwhile Vienna is forging ahead, and its experience as a climate leader holds lessons and inspiration for cities around the world.

Cities play a big role in cutting fossil fuels
At the edge of an old airfield in eastern Vienna there's a 15-story tall drilling rig where men in hardhats move seven-inch metal pipes. The clangs of the pipes echo as they fall to the ground.

Bernhard Novotny
, project director for the site, says the pipes are for geothermal wells. The wells stretch miles underground to extract boiling water that lies under the earth's subsurface. That hot water will heat 20,000 Viennese homes by 2028, Novotny says.
Vienna has a goal of getting its buildings completely off gas by 2040. The city got off Russian gas in January, Wien Energie spokesman Alexander Hoor, says. Getting off gas ties into the city's climate goals because gas infrastructure leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and gas also releases carbon dioxide when burned. To get off gas, Vienna plans to heat buildings using heat pumps, capturing gases from waste, burning waste, and geothermal wells.
These geothermal wells are a joint-venture between Vienna-based energy company, OMV, and Vienna's municipal heating and electrical utility, Wien Energie. Being a municipal utility means the company has a stable climate strategy linked to Vienna's, says
Rusbeh Rezania
, Wien Energie's head of decarbonized heating. That consistency has given Wien Energie flexibility to experiment with new combinations of energy sources, Resania says. ""We are not like a private company in which the strategy is changing every year or every two years,"" Rezania says. "" We have time to learn, and we can have time to use the right technology.""

Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
A coach to help you decarbonize
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.
Nearly a third
of the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's why
electrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution
. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from an
increasingly cleaner grid
.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,
according to the energy transition group RMI
. And Consumer Reports found in a
2022 survey
that while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""

As LA rebuilds after wildfires, climate activists want people to go all-electric
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""

States and nonprofits offer coaching too
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency the
Efficiency Maine Trust
.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
Climate
Switching from gas to electric? Here are 3 appliances that are easy to install
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.

The acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Cameron Hamilton, has been replaced, according to a statement from the agency. The move comes at a time of turmoil for FEMA, after President Trump has said repeatedly that the country's primary disaster response agency should be eliminated.
Just a day prior, Hamilton testified at a Congressional hearing that while FEMA needs efficiency and ""meaningful reform,"" its core goal is to ""focus on survivors.""

The Trump Administration is seeking to shrink the role of FEMA by
shifting responsibility for disaster response
to the states. Local and state governments are already responsible for responding to disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, but they request the federal government's help when the emergency exceeds local capacity.
Trump
signed an executive order
stating that a focus on state responsibility would reduce ""taxpayer burdens through efficiency"" and at Wednesday's Congressional hearing, Hamilton said the threshold for federal involvement should be raised. Trump has also

Many states say they currently don't have the staff or resources to take on more disaster response. Major disasters, like Hurricane Helene last year, require thousands of employees to find survivors, set up shelters and process requests for disaster assistance. The country is also seeing an increasing number of disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage, as storms, hurricanes and wildfires get more intense as the climate gets hotter.
Democratic congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who asked Hamilton the question about eliminating FEMA at Wednesday's hearing, demanded answers about his departure.
""President Trump fires anyone who is not blindly loyal to him,"" DeLauro said in a statement. ""Integrity and morality should not cost you your job, and if it does, it says more about your employer than it does you."""

Preparing an emergency go bag can be overwhelming.
It can be hard to know exactly what to pack. Buying food and supplies or opting for a premade survival kit can be expensive. And the task of gathering dozens of random items can feel like a big to-do.
It's no wonder that only about half of Americans say they've assembled or updated their stash of emergency supplies, according to a

Go bag essentials: Tips to save money and effort
Between the
American Red Cross
and

, a lot of go bag checklists are out there with helpful ideas about what to pack. If you're concerned about the cost and effort to gather the recommended items, remember that ""something is better than nothing,"" Provencio says.
Provencio and
Jonathan Sury
, a senior staff associate at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia Climate School, share a list of items to prioritize, along with tips on how to make packing effortless and budget friendly.
🎒
A good bag.
It should be sturdy enough to hold your food and emergency supplies, as well as light enough to carry with you in case you have to evacuate on foot, Provencio says. Bonus points if the bag has wheels and straps for easy transport, Sury says.
Life Kit
Hurricane preparedness: Expert guidance on flooding, power outages and more
Money-saving tip:
No need to buy a tactical, state-of-the-art backpack. An old duffel bag or even a heavy-duty, oversize tote bag will do, Provencio says.
💧
At least a gallon of water.
You should ideally pack a gallon of water per person a day for three days, but you may find that three jugs of water will make a bag too heavy. Pack at least 1 gallon of water, Sury says, or as much as you can carry, Provencio says.
🍫
Three days of food.
Choose lightweight, calorie-dense foods, like granola bars, peanut butter and tuna in pouches, Provencio says.

Money-saving tip:
Break up the task of buying food into small chunks. It'll make the process ""more manageable financially, and it's just as effective,"" Provencio says. Pick up one or two items, like a couple of energy bars or some beef jerky, each paycheck. Or buy in bulk, Sury says.
💉
Items vital to your personal situation.
For some people, that might mean lifesaving prescription medicines, a cane for walking or a favorite toy to comfort your little one.
Effort-saving tip:
It can be hard to narrow down a list of personal items. So if it helps, pretend like you're packing for a weekend trip rather than ""a Hollywood-style disaster,"" Provencio says. ""Most likely, you'll be spending a couple of days at a friend's house away from the immediate hazard. So ask yourself: What would you need if you had to leave your house suddenly for a few days?""

.
Money-saving tip:
Premade first-aid kits are convenient, but it will be cheaper to make your own kit, Sury says. Consider buying items like bandages and hydrogen peroxide in bulk and assemble your own kits.
📜
Important documents.
These include photocopies of insurance paperwork, your birth certificate and the deed to your house. Put them in a zip-close bag to protect them from water damage. You could also save digital copies on a flash drive or the cloud too, Provencio says.
Effort-saving tip:
Gathering all the paperwork to photocopy or scan can be a big task, so save this job for when you've got spare time on your hands. ""It's daunting, but once you have those copies backed up, your work is done,"" Sury says.
Sponsor Message
🔪 Emergency supplies.
As you look through different go bag checklists, you'll see a wide range of supplies like work gloves or plastic sheeting. At the very least, Provencio says, your bag should contain the following items: a multi-tool or knife; paracord or rope for, say, pitching a tent; duct tape for making repairs; a flashlight or headlamp with extra batteries; and something with which to start a fire. Sury says it's also a good idea to pack an emergency blanket.
Money-saving tip:
Shop your junk drawer or garage,
Provencio says. You'll be surprised how many batteries, candles and lighters you'll find. While rummaging through discount bins or yard sales, look out for flashlights and multipurpose tools. Buy used items, like a headlamp, online.
🪥 Personal hygiene supplies.
If you had to live off the land for a few days, what would you need? Provencio suggests wet wipes, a toothbrush, toothpaste and sanitary products.
📲 A power bank
with which to charge your phone so you can make emergency calls. Don't forget to keep it charged, Sury says.
💵 Some cash.
Don't assume you'll be able to use your credit cards or get cash from an ATM in an emergency, Provencio says. You should have enough money to buy a full tank of gas and a day's worth of food, Sury says. ""For those low on resources, it's always tough to set aside some cash, but a little here and there will add up.""
My go bag is packed. Now what?
""Once you have your bag together, all you need to do is maintain it and make sure it's in good condition a couple times a year,"" Sury says. Swap out the expired food and replenish any bandages you may have swiped from the first-aid kit.
Don't forget to create a basic emergency plan. ""Knowing your evacuation routes, identifying a meeting place for your family and writing down key phone numbers costs nothing but can make a huge difference,"" Provencio says. ""Even simply being mentally prepared and thinking through [disaster] scenarios can help you act more quickly and confidently under stress.""

Most people in the United States rely on federal science in their daily lives but don't realize it, a new nationwide poll of U.S. adults shows.
The poll was conducted in early April by the Association of Science and Technology Centers, the association for science museums and other educational science centers in the U.S.
The poll found that on a weekly basis more than 90% of people use weather forecasts, job market reports, food safety warnings and other information that is based on federal science. But only 10% of respondents are concerned that cuts to federal support for science might impact their access to such information.
Sponsor Message
The Trump administration has made deep budget and personnel cuts to federal agencies that
collect weather data
and do safety inspections at factories that make
food and prescription drugs
, among many science-related functions.
The association conducted the poll to understand current attitudes about science in the U.S. and inform how their member institutions, which include science museums, aquariums and zoos, can better serve the public.
""I think there is a gap between what people use and their understanding of where that information comes from,"" says Erica Kimmerling, a senior adviser for the Association of Science and Technology Centers who was involved in the poll. She says that gap isn't particularly surprising because everyday information that is based on federal data, such as weather forecasts, ""doesn't have a label that says 'brought to you by the federal government'.""
Americans rely on federal data about the weather, economy and food supply
Weather forecasts are one of the most ubiquitous federal science products in American life, the poll found. The vast majority of those polled said they use weather forecasts on a day-to-day basis. All U.S. weather forecasts, including those on nightly TV broadcasts, in the newspaper and on phone apps, rely on a host of federally supported data.

That includes weather data compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from ocean buoys, balloons, aircraft and ships, as well as data from satellites that are built, launched and maintained by NASA. The data is then pulled together into local extreme weather warnings that are written and distributed by National Weather Service local offices across the country.
About half of respondents said they rely on economic data from the government, including job market reports and information about inflation. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve compile and publish those reports.
And Americans also rely on the federal government for food safety and public health information, the poll found. About a third of respondents said they use food safety information, influenza updates and other public health information to make day-to-day decisions. The Department of Health and Human Services makes such information available to the public.
""The poll showed how frequently Americans count on federally provided data in their everyday lives. Everything from weather data to information about food safety to economic data,"" says Arati Prabhakar, a retired federal science official and venture capitalist who has run multiple federal science programs in her career including the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Prabhakar was not involved in the poll.
People of both parties think science is important for prosperity
Political polarization around trust in science has grown in the last 25 years, and today Republicans
trust scientists at much lower rates
than Democrats.
But the new poll suggests there is some agreement across party affiliation. It found 90% of respondents think federal investment in STEM education is important for future economic prosperity, and the majority of respondents from both parties are concerned about policy changes that might make it harder for the U.S. to attract and retain top scientists.
""This is a point of some ideological alignment,"" says Eve Klein, a senior adviser for the Association of Science and Technology Centers who was involved in the poll.

President Trump's rapid-fire spending cuts have affected communities all over the country — including strongholds of his supporters.
One of them is Rising Sun, Maryland. The town had won two FEMA grants designed to mitigate the effects of catastrophic flooding. And though the area voted overwhelmingly to support Trump's re-election, his administration has now cancelled the program that funded those grants.
Across the state in the Trump-voting town of Emmitsburg, Maryland, a similar scenario is playing out. The town is home to the National Fire Academy — a sort of national war college for training firefighters in America. In March, the Trump administration abruptly cancelled classes at the academy, and locals are concerned about how that will affect the town's economy — and emergency preparedness across the country.

could see the critically endangered species stage a comeback in its native Mexico City, as researchers announced their findings that captive-bred axolotls can survive in the wild.
Researchers at the Autonomous University of Baja California this week said that they tracked a total of 18 captive-bred axolotls — nine male and nine female — which were released across two aquatic locations in southern Mexico City in 2017 and 2018.
""What we learned is if we can reintroduce these axolotls that have been in captivity to the restored wetland where the water conditions are ideal for the axolotls, they can survive,"" said Alejandra Ramos, lead researcher on the study published in the scientific journal
PLOS One
.

Animals
To save axolotls, a campaign in Mexico asks people to virtually adopt them
""This is pretty big news because when you have animals in captivity, they lose a lot of their behaviors. Like, they don't know how to recognize a predator, they don't know how to catch prey, and so we were a bit nervous when we released them because we didn't know if they were going to be able to survive,"" she continued.
But the charmingly cartoonish salamanders, also known as Mexican walking fish, didn't just survive in their new wild homes, they thrived.
""The ones that we recaptured, they had gained weight. So that means they were doing really, really well,"" Ramos said.
""They were hunting, they were eating, and they were avoiding predators. So this was really big,"" she said.
Axolotls — named for the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl — are native to the lakes of Mexico's capital. But their colorful, whimsical looks have won them admirers the world over.

It seems like everyone wants an axolotl since the salamander was added to Minecraft
The exotic aquatic critters are also a favorite among
medical researchers
, who hope that the amphibians' extreme regenerative abilities — down to the ability to restore their own brain, heart and lungs — could eventually help doctors better treat catastrophic injuries in people.
Despite their popularity, axolotls are critically endangered in the wild due to human interference and pollution in their habitats, with estimates of just
50 to 1,000 adults left
in the wild.
The axolotls studied by Ramos and her team were released in both artificial and restored wetlands.
Short Wave
A Lotl Love For The Axolotl
The animals' ability to survive in both environments was an additional layer of success. The study notes that if axolotls could survive in man-made habitats, it could help scale back the damaging effects of habitat degradation and climate change.
For Ramos, who has been working on this research since 2017, the ability to help save the axolotl goes beyond just science.
""For Mexicans, they're part of our culture, they're part of our history. And that makes them really special to us,"" she said."

EPA announces dozens of environmental regulations it plans to target
The agency plans major changes in the Office of Research and Development, the wing of EPA that provides scientific analysis on the risks of air pollution, chemicals, and other environmental hazards. It plans to move some scientific staff from ORD into existing policy-making offices, which write regulations, and send others to newly created offices.
In a meeting on Friday, EPA leadership told ORD staff to expect cuts in the coming weeks.
Former EPA official Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta says the reorganization could undermine research at the EPA, and its ability to protect human health.
""By splitting things up or eliminating that expertise, we put people at greater risk and we put this country at greater risk,"" Orme-Zavaleta says.
The ORD has historically provided independent scientific assessments about the risks of environmental contaminants, from lead in drinking water to air pollution. Its scientists have provided foundational research into some of the country's most challenging environmental problems.
ORD researchers were some of the first to identify sources of PFAS as health hazards over a decade ago, for example. Before that, research from a
North Carolina laboratory
established direct links between breathing in different amounts of ozone – the primary component of smog – and health problems like asthma. Policymakers within the agency rely on ORD science to design rules to protect Americans from pollution.

""The magnitude of these kinds of cuts would really affect the entire research enterprise of the EPA,"" says Chris Frey, a dean of research at North Carolina State University who led ORD during the Biden Administration.
In an op-ed published Friday in

He says the proposed changes will save an estimated $300 million by 2026 – a roughly 3% savings compared to the agency's 2024 budget of more than
$9 billion

Scientific staff worry about ""musical chairs""
In a meeting Friday, EPA leaders encouraged ORD's 1500 staff to apply for the roughly 500 new positions created in the reorganization.
""I feel like they're playing musical chairs, but taking out half the chairs, and everyone else is going to get cut,"" says an EPA staff scientist who attended the meeting. NPR is not using their name because they fear retribution for speaking publicly.

The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to undo three federal waivers that let California set strict vehicle pollution standards. On Wednesday, the House voted against two waivers involving heavy trucking, and on Thursday, it voted to reverse a state rule that would require all new vehicles in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.
Two nonpartisan government entities have advised Congress that it can't actually reverse those waivers through the mechanism it's using. The Senate now needs to decide whether to follow that guidance — or follow the House.

'We are not California': New Jersey dealers push back on electric truck rules
California's standards have been described by supporters as ambitious, and by critics as unrealistic. Beginning with model year 2026, the state requires 35% of new cars sold by any given automaker to be zero-emission. Currently, about 25% of new cars sold in California are electric; the national average is closer to 10%.
These rules are not something automakers can brush off or overlook. California is a huge state and a major auto market. Other states can't set their own standards, but they can opt to follow California's, and about a dozen have adopted its zero-emission rule. The result is that more than 30% of the U.S. auto market is governed by California's policies.
""California's waiver has a massive impact,"" Stephanie Brinley, the associate director of AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility, wrote in a report in January 2025.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, had pushed hard for Congress to step in and overrule California because they argue that consumer demand for EVs is not strong enough to support California's targets. John Bozzella, the trade group's president, has warned that meeting the requirements
would ""take a miracle""
and said in a statement Wednesday that ""thousands of American auto jobs and millions of units of U.S. auto production are at stake.""

Environmental groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists argue that flexibilities built into the rules make them

Here's how we got here, and what's next.
What is a ""California waiver""?
Picture Los Angeles in the 1940s and '50s. Beautiful beaches, palm trees and picturesque homes — that were impossible to see behind a thick haze. That choking smog was fueled by air pollution from cars and industry, which became trapped mid-air by mountains and wind patterns.
Facing this unusually severe problem, the state began regulating air pollution well before the federal government did. As a result, California has a unique privilege: It, alone among U.S. states, can impose its own emissions standards that are stricter than the nation's.
Each time California wants to add a new, stricter rule, it has to obtain a waiver from the EPA. It's done that more than 75 times.
Environment
Biden administration approves California plans to ban sale of gas-only vehicles
Today, the House voted to rescind the waiver that let California issue its zero-emission rule for passenger cars, along with two more that allow California to set rules for heavy trucks. One rule would require more heavy trucks to be electric, while the other would require new diesel vehicles to become cleaner.
Those three California rules aren't
just
about reducing smog. Cars and trucks are a major source of the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet. Increasingly, California has become a
global leader
in reducing the carbon emissions that fuel climate change, and zero-emission vehicles are a key part of those climate policies.
Climate
EPA announces dozens of environmental regulations it plans to target
California's climate-minded vehicle regulations, far more aggressive than the federal standards and explicitly designed to fight climate change, have long
outraged
President Trump and his
allies
. Trump has dismissed climate concerns and
prioritized the domestic fossil fuel industry
, and
opposes regulations
that he describes as limiting consumer choice.
The Trump administration is working to eliminate a number of the Biden administration's pro-EV policies, from
freezing EV charger funding
to
reconsidering federal vehicle standards
.
But even if the administration eases federal standards, California's tougher rules still push the auto industry to move aggressively toward EVs. That's why reversing these waivers is a key part of the Trump administration's broader deregulation plan.
Sponsor Message
Wait, didn't this happen before?
Yes. During the first Trump presidency, the federal government revoked a waiver that allowed California to set its own vehicle standards. That had never been done before, and triggered years of litigation.
It also split the auto industry. Some companies that had already made costly investments based on existing rules, and that were looking for some consistency among flip-flopping policies, sided with California. They agreed to follow the state's rules regardless of whether they were legally required to. Others sided with the Trump administration. The whole situation was messy, chaotic and, ultimately, temporary.
When Biden took office, the waiver was reinstated. Over the next few years California made its rules even stricter, requiring a new waiver to be granted — the one on passenger vehicles that the House just voted to nix.
What's different this time?
The new Trump administration is now trying a different tactic to eliminate these waivers.
The EPA grants them. In the first Trump term, it was also the EPA that revoked the passenger vehicle waiver. As soon as Biden was in office, the EPA just issued the waiver again. That flip-flopping could, hypothetically, continue with each new administration, unless something changes.
This time, Congress is attempting to use the Congressional Review Act to reverse the EPA's decision to grant these waivers in the first place. It's a little bit like pressing an ""undo"" button, wiping the waivers out of existence.
It's only an option within a narrow window of time — and it only works if the president's party controls Congress. (Trump used this tool heavily in his
first administration
.) Significantly, rules that are reversed under the CRA
may not be reissued
in ""substantially the same form"" unless Congress passes a new law authorizing that specific rule.
The Congressional Review Act also states that actions taken under it are not subject to judicial review, meaning that courts can't overturn Congress' decision. But if the California waiver is in fact revoked under the CRA, expect legal challenges anyway.

""It's guaranteed,"" says Christopher ""Smitty"" Smith, an environmental lawyer in California. ""And that's something I'm willing to state: It's

What's next?
Now, the Senate has a decision to make.
The Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, believes the waiver is
not actually eligible
for this kind of reversal. So does the Senate parliamentarian, a sort of referee over what Congress can and can't do according to its own rules.
Three Democratic senators
say the parliamentarian ""reaffirmed"" in early April that the waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act.
The parliamentarian is not elected, and while her rulings hold significant weight in the Senate, they are not binding.
But overruling the parliamentarian violates long-held Senate norms — the same norms that keep the filibuster in place.
Reports
indicate
that some Republican senators have been weighing whether eliminating the California rules justifies breaking that norm.
Lobbying on this issue has been intense, with traditional automakers and the oil industry pushing hard for Congress to eliminate the rules, and public health groups like the American Lung Association joining environmental and EV groups to defend California's policies."

These rural communities were awarded grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fix long-standing infrastructure problems, and they expected funding to be delivered this year. But last month, the Trump administration canceled their grants and hundreds of others, including ones that had already been promised but not yet paid out.

Since 2020, FEMA has awarded about $4.6 billion to communities across the U.S. through a program known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC). The goal was to help local, state and tribal governments protect residents from future disasters such as floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes.

Those disasters are becoming costlier, with the country experiencing increasing numbers of events with
billion-dollar price tags
as climate change drives more extreme weather. Research shows that improving buildings and infrastructure before disasters happen can reduce the overall damage and cost when they hit.
""Programs like BRIC really help us avoid these ballooning disaster costs that we've seen, by simply being more proactive,"" says Kristin Smith, a researcher who studies disaster funding at Headwaters Economics, a think tank that studies development and land management decisions. ""We pay a little now or a lot tomorrow.""

Rural communities are hit particularly hard by the lost funds
Many small, rural communities applied for federal money because they have no other option. For many, federal funding is the only source large enough to update the aging infrastructure that's vulnerable to increasingly intense disasters.

The town of Rising Sun has about 2,800 residents. It's just upstream from the Chesapeake Bay and is crisscrossed by creeks that have repeatedly flooded, endangering residents in a mobile home park and causing the sewage treatment plant to release contaminated water.
But moving residents to higher ground and upgrading the sewage plant costs tens of millions of dollars that the town doesn't have. ""You know, not everyone is wealthy,"" says Calvin Bonenberger Jr., the longtime town administrator in Rising Sun. The local government collects only about $1 million in property tax revenue each year, he says.

Exclusive: Trump administration drops work on stronger building codes for disasters
The solution was to apply for federal money, even though Bonenberger says federal involvement in local projects isn't always popular in the heavily conservative area. And Rising Sun was well positioned to win money, despite steep competition from other towns across the country. That's because FEMA developed equity policies to prioritize helping places that had no alternative source of funding, such as rural towns and communities with lower average incomes.
Last year, FEMA awarded Rising Sun two grants for a total of about $5 million.

With the money promised, Bonenberger was making concrete plans to move residents out of the flood zone and start fixing the wastewater plant. Now, with the grants canceled, the town is back to square one.
Bonenberger is frustrated. ""This is dangerous,"" he says. When it rains, volunteer firefighters in town have to rescue people from the low-lying mobile homes. ""We are sitting here with the possibility of 10 to 15 trailers being negatively impacted. And volunteer firefighters who give up their lives for the community. What, becoming electrocuted? Drowning?"" he argues. ""So why can't we put the horse in front of the cart? It's avoidable.""
In Rising Sun, trailers that were damaged by floodwaters years ago sit empty. Many people have left the neighborhood. Others stay, despite the risk of a future flood that could trap them in their homes.

Trump wants states to handle disasters. States aren't prepared
""There's no way that any small community could afford to do anything without some government aid to help them,"" says Hoffert, of DePue. ""There's just too much expense.""
FEMA's BRIC program was designed to fill the gap that small communities face. When a disaster hits, the federal government pays for the majority of the damage, including rebuilding public infrastructure like roads and schools, as well as helping individuals who lost their homes. In the face of those escalating costs, BRIC was established during Trump's first term to help communities prepare their infrastructure and lessen the damage.
""FEMA is excited about BRIC's potential to help communities proactively reduce their vulnerability to natural hazard events, and in turn, make the nation more resilient,""
read a FEMA statement
when the Trump administration announced the program in 2020.
Studies show preparing for disasters ahead of time can mean significant savings. For every $1 invested in preparation, between $4 and $11 is avoided in losses,
according to a report
from the National Institute of Building Sciences, a nonprofit research group.
More than
$4.6 billion in BRIC grants
have been awarded since 2020, including to schools seeking to build tornado shelters and to tribal nations for emergency management plans. Only 1.3% of that funding has been paid out to communities so far, according to an analysis by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It can take years for communities to do the planning, engineering and paperwork required by FEMA to receive funds.

The Trump administration is
pushing states to take on more
of the nation's disaster preparedness, though many states say they're unprepared to do so. Disaster experts say underinvesting in improving the country's infrastructure will simply lead to bigger costs in the long run, especially as storms, hurricanes and wildfires get more intense as the climate gets hotter.
""Disasters strike every community,"" Smith says. ""There's risk everywhere, and without these federal investments in prevention, we're stuck in this cycle of really expensive disaster bill-outs. And those costs fall on all of us as taxpayers.""

Years of planning comes to a halt
Hoffert spent years looking for a way to fix the DePue sewage treatment plant. It was built in a low-lying area, so heavy rainstorms inundate the facility with floodwater, shutting it down. This causes sewage to back up in the pipes, which means residents in town aren't able to flush their toilets. Hoffert says a recent storm caused flooding in more than 100 homes, some with sewage in their basements.
The village is hoping to build a new wastewater treatment plant on higher ground, costing around $25 million. But for the community of around 1,500 residents, the price tag is out of reach.
""That's more tax money than we'll get in 25 years, maybe 50 years,"" Hoffert says.
DePue's FEMA BRIC grant of $23 million required that the village match it with $2 million in local funds, which was already going to be a stretch. Hoffert says they've already spent tens of thousands of dollars designing and planning the new treatment plant, believing that the FEMA grant was on its way.

""It was probably within a month or two of being OK, so that's really harsh,"" he says of the grant money that DePue awaited. ""If you don't do anything for small communities in this country, they're just going to get washed away.""

Searching for new sources of funding
Now, many small, rural communities are starting an urgent search for other sources of funding. In Kamiah, Idaho, deputy city clerk Mike Tornatore says he'd already told residents that the grant was on its way. With Kamiah having seen destructive wildfires in the past, its BRIC grant focused on fire protection.
""This community, due to the age of it, the building materials that were used at that time, we are ripe for a fire to sweep through this community and burn it to the ground,"" Tornatore says.
Since Kamiah is a lower-income area, Tornatore says many residents can't afford to prepare their homes for wildfires. That includes cutting down trees and brush around structures, which can spread a wildfire if they ignite, as well as installing fire-resistant roofs and siding, which reduce the chances a house will burn. The FEMA funding would have provided grants for residents who need it, and Tornatore says there were already more requests than he could fund.
""I have 30 people waiting to receive these grants,"" he says. ""But I'll find another way for them. I will. It's what I have to do.""
Like many small communities, Kamiah has a limited capacity to do disaster planning and apply for grants. Tornatore already does several jobs for the town but was able to spearhead the wildfire project with help from
FEMA's BRIC Direct Technical Assistance program
, which provided training on infrastructure planning, risk assessment and community engagement.
Now, he's trying to remain optimistic that the project won't be lost, if he can find funding from the state of Idaho or another source. He's hoping small communities that lost FEMA grants will find ways to strategize together, given limited options without the federal government's help.

He's also hoping to get a meeting with Trump about the impact of what the administration has canceled. Residents in Kamiah's county, like the counties that include DePue and Rising Sun, voted overwhelmingly for Trump.
""I'd just want to educate him about what this means to a rural community,"" Tornatore says."

A judge in the United Kingdom has recommended the extradition of a private investigator to the United States whom the Justice Department accuses of leading a hacking operation that targeted American climate activists.
The
hacking was allegedly commissioned
by a Washington, D.C., lobbying and consulting firm that worked for a major oil and gas company in Texas, according to an indictment the Justice Department filed in the UK as part of its extradition request. A federal prosecutor said in an affidavit that the goal was to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate-change litigation in the U.S.

The Justice Department has charged the private investigator, an Israeli named Amit Forlit, with conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Forlit has previously denied ordering or paying for hacking.
Forlit has two weeks to appeal the ruling. ""The score is one-nil to the U.S.,"" Forlit's lawyer, Edward Grange, said Wednesday outside of court in London. He added, ""This is the beginning of a long road.""
Climate and environmental activists who were targeted by hackers say the attacks were intended to silence critics of the fossil fuel industry. But the attacks also represent a broad assault on American civil society, says Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund and a target of the hacking.
""It's a very big issue that transcends, really, the most basic aspects of freedom and citizens' ability to participate in their governmental processes,"" Wasserman says.
The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
""This is an important step toward accountability and to bring into the light the evidence that the U.S. government has,"" says Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The continuation of legal proceedings through this extradition could help to confirm who hired [Forlit] and hold those people accountable.""

U.S. prosecutor named the D.C. lobbying firm that allegedly commissioned the hacking
In the indictment against Forlit, the names of the oil and gas company and the lobbying firm Forlit allegedly worked for are anonymized. However, the prosecutor's affidavit fails to anonymize the ""D.C. lobbying firm"" in one part of the document. About halfway through the 30-page affidavit, the prosecutor cites emails in which ""DCI Group"" employees allegedly shared versions of a stolen memo belonging to an environmental lawyer, as well as information about people who received the memo.
NPR couldn't confirm that the Justice Department is referring to DCI every time the affidavit mentions the ""D.C. lobbying firm."" However, the Justice Department only cites one lobbying firm in the affidavit.
DCI was a longtime lobbyist for ExxonMobil and has deep ties to the U.S. fossil fuel industry. A lawyer for Forlit
said in a court filing
earlier this year that the hacking operation her client is accused of leading ""is alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies.""
Forlit's lawyer
claimed the U.S. is trying to prosecute Forlit
, in part, ""to advance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.""
A DCI executive, Craig Stevens, didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Stevens previously told NPR that no one at the firm has been questioned by the U.S. government as part of the hacking investigation. ""Allegations of DCI's involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false and unsubstantiated. We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law,"" Stevens said. ""Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities.""
ExxonMobil referred to a previous statement in which the company told NPR it has not been ""involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" The company has said it has repeatedly acknowledged ""climate change is real, and we have an entire business dedicated to reducing emissions.""

ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies face dozens of climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. The lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The U.S. government is not part of the litigation. The fossil fuel industry says the lawsuits are meritless and politicized, and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.
Climate activists protest on the first day of an ExxonMobil trial outside the New York State Supreme Court building in 2019 in New York City. Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court ultimately found that the New York Attorney General's Office failed to prove that ExxonMobil broke the law.

Victims say the hacking was aimed at silencing fossil-fuel critics
As part of the Justice Department investigation, one of Forlit's business associates, another Israeli private investigator named Aviram Azari,
was sentenced to prison
in the U.S. in late 2023 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Azari hired hackers who targeted American climate activists, as well as government officials in Africa, members of a Mexican political party and critics of a German company called Wirecard, according to federal prosecutors.
In a
sentencing memo for Azari
, prosecutors singled out ExxonMobil, saying the company used news stories based on information stolen from activists as part of its defense against state climate investigations. Prosecutors didn't accuse ExxonMobil or DCI of wrongdoing in that case.
Months after Azari's sentencing, Forlit was arrested under an Interpol Red Notice at London's Heathrow airport on his way to Tel Aviv.
The affidavit filed in Forlit's extradition case details how the Justice Department alleges the hacking operation worked:
The D.C. lobbying firm allegedly identified people and organizations it wanted to discredit as part of its work for the Texas oil company;
Forlit or a co-conspirator allegedly gave Azari lists of people or accounts that were of interest to the D.C. lobbying firm;
Azari then allegedly hired hackers to target the climate activists;
Later, the lobbying firm allegedly shared with the oil company private documents — or versions of documents —  that were ""likely obtained through the successful hacking,"" according to the prosecutor's affidavit.

HONOLULU — In a first-of-its kind move, Hawaii lawmakers are ready to hike a tax imposed on travelers staying in hotels, vacation rentals and other short-term accommodations and earmark the new money for programs to cope with a warming planet.
State leaders say they'll use the funds for projects like replenishing sand on eroding beaches, helping homeowners install hurricane clips on their roofs and removing invasive grasses like those that fueled the deadly wildfire that destroyed Lahaina two years ago.
A bill scheduled for House and Senate votes on Wednesday would add an additional 0.75% to the daily room rate tax starting Jan. 1. It's all but certain to pass given Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers and party leaders have agreed on the measure. Gov. Josh Green has said he would sign it into law.

Officials estimate the increase would generate $100 million in new revenue annually.
""We had a $13 billion tragedy in Maui and we lost 102 people. These kind of dollars will help us prevent that next disaster,"" Green said in an interview.
Green said Hawaii was the first state in the nation to do something along these lines. Andrey Yushkov, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization, said he was unaware of any other state that has set aside lodging tax revenue for the purposes of environmental protection or climate change.
Adding to an already hefty taxThe increase will add to what is already a relatively large duty on short-term stays. The state's existing 10.25% tax on daily room rates would climb to 11%. In addition, Hawaii's counties each add their own 3% surcharge and the state and counties impose a combined 4.712% general excise tax on goods and services including hotel rooms. Together, that will make for a tax rate of nearly 19%.
The only large U.S. cities that have higher cumulative state and local lodging tax rates are Omaha, Nebraska, at 20.5%, and Cincinnati, at 19.3%, according to
a 2024 report by HVS
, a global hospitality consulting firm.
The governor has long said the 10 million visitors who come to Hawaii each year should help the state's 1.4 million residents protect the environment.
Climate
The role climate change played in Hawaii's devastating wildfires
Green believes travelers will be willing to pay the increased tax because doing so will enable Hawaii to ""keep the beaches perfect"" and preserve favorite spots like Maui's road to Hana and the coastline along Oahu's North Shore. After the Maui wildfire, Green said he heard from thousands of people across the country asking how they could help. This is a significant way they can, he said.
Hotel industry has mixed feelingsJerry Gibson, president of the Hawaii Hotel Alliance, which represents the state's hotel operators, said the industry was pleased lawmakers didn't adopt a higher increase that was initially proposed.
Sponsor Message
""I don't think that there's anybody in the tourism industry that says, 'Well, let's go out and tax more.' No one wants to see that,"" Gibson said. ""But our state, at the same time, needs money.""
The silver lining, Gibson said, is that the money is supposed to beautify Hawaii's environment. It will be worth it if that's the case, he said.
Hawaii has long struggled to pay for the vast environmental and conservation needs of the islands, ranging from
protecting coral reefs
to weeding invasive plants to making sure tourists don't harass wildlife, such as Hawaiian monk seals. The state must also maintain a large network of trails, many of which have heavier foot traffic as more travelers choose to hike on vacation.
Two years ago, lawmakers considered requiring tourists to pay for a yearlong license or pass to visit state parks and trails. Green wanted to have all visitors pay a $50 fee to enter the state, an idea lawmakers said would violate U.S. constitutional protections for free travel.
Climate
Hawaii reaches landmark climate settlement
Boosting the lodging tax is their compromise solution, one made more urgent by the Maui wildfires.
A large funding gapAn advocacy group, Care for Aina Now, calculated a $561 million gap between Hawaii's conservation funding needs and money spent each year.
Green acknowledged the revenue from the tax increase falls short of this, but said the state would issue bonds to leverage the money it raises. Most of the $100 million would go toward measures that can be handled in a one-to-two year time frame, while $10 to $15 million of it would pay for bonds supporting long-term infrastructure projects.
Kāwika Riley, a member of the governor's Climate Advisory Team, pointed to the Hawaiian saying, ""A stranger only for a day,"" to explain the new tax. The adage means that a visitor should help with the work after the first day of being a guest.

The Trump Administration has dismissed the scientists working on the country's flagship climate report, a move that threatens to curtail climate science and make information about global warming less available to the public.
The
National Climate Assessment
is the most trustworthy and comprehensive source of information about how global warming affects the United States. It
answers common questions
about how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities, how much rain is normal for different regions and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure.
The assessment is mandated by Congress, and its sixth edition was supposed to be released in late 2027. About 400 volunteer authors had already started work. They included top scientists as well as economists, tribal leaders and climate experts from non-profit groups and corporations.
Sponsor Message
On Tuesday, the authors received an email releasing them from their roles, and saying ""the scope of the [National Climate Assessment] is currently being reevaluated.""
The White House did not respond to questions about why the authors were dismissed or what elements of the report's scope are being reassessed.
""I think the reason that Americans should be upset, and should be concerned about this decision, is because it's more than just a report,"" says Dave White, a sustainability researcher at Arizona State University who has worked on two previous editions of the National Climate Assessment.
The assessment is widely used by everyone from city planners to farmers to judges. ""For example, city water utilities [use it] as they prepare to address the impacts of sustained drought,"" White says. And ""it informs elementary schools as they develop heat mitigation plans to reduce the risks of extreme heat on children.""
The last edition of the climate assessment, which was released in late 2023, also included an online atlas that allowed anyone to zoom in and see how climate change will affect their local community.
""It's important to understand what and who is at risk,"" explains Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists, one of the authors who was dismissed. ""Not just in a general sense, but in a very localized sense. Without that information, we'd be flying blind.""
Sponsor Message
For example, Cleetus was supposed to work on the assessment chapter about sea level rise and other coastal effects of a warmer planet. Sea level rise is accelerating overall, but the water is rising radically different amounts in different cities around the U.S.
Congress requires that the National Climate Assessment come out every four years, although it has not always been published on time under previous Republican administrations. In 2008, the George W. Bush administration released an edition of the assessment four years late, and only after it was compelled to do so by a lawsuit.
And there were signs even before President Trump took office that his administration might seek to undermine the latest edition of the assessment. Russell Vought, who now leads the White House Office of Management and Budget, previously advocated for major changes to the office that oversees the National Climate Assessment."

President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at making it easier for companies to mine the deep seafloor, saying it would create ""a robust domestic supply for critical minerals.""
There is currently no commercial-scale deep-sea mining anywhere in the world. But companies have long eyed the ocean floor as a potential source of metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese and copper, which are used in batteries for electric vehicles and other technologies.
Climate
The world has no rulebook for deep-sea mining. One company is pushing forward anyway
These metals can be found in potato-sized nodules lying on the ocean floor. Many of the nodules are in the middle of the Pacific ocean, beyond the legal territory of individual countries.
Thursday's order might circumvent
ongoing international negotiations
to regulate deep-sea mining.
Those regions have traditionally been overseen by an international organization, the International Seabed Authority (ISA). The ISA has hosted talks for years to try to hammer out a rulebook to govern a potential seabed mining industry. The U.S. did not ratify the treaty that governs the seabed, and is not a voting member of the ISA, though in the past under previous administrations it has respected the ISA process.

In his
executive order,
Trump instructed federal agencies to expedite the process for reviewing and issuing permits for mining on the seafloor in both U.S. and international territory. It will use a U.S. law from 1980, the ""Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act.""
Scientists and environmental groups condemned the order, arguing that opening the deep seabed for mining could disrupt important marine ecosystems, and damage the fishing industry.
""This is being planned on some of the least resilient ecosystems on the planet,"" says
Douglas McCauley
, professor of ocean science at the University of California Santa Barbara. ""It would have catastrophic biological consequences.""
Underwater mining can create plumes of sediment that could suffocate marine life, and degrade the food webs that fish depend on, McCauley says.
There are also important questions about whether we actually need to be mining the seabed to get enough of these minerals for technologies like batteries, says
Micah Ziegler
, assistant professor of energy and chemical systems at Georgia Institute of Technology.
While a couple of years ago researchers were concerned about the limitations of land-based mining for metals like cobalt and nickel, a variety of alternative battery chemistries have been developed that might reduce the need for those elements, Ziegler says.

""People said we were going to be cobalt-limited and then we found a bunch of alternative chemistries that use less [or no] cobalt,"" Ziegler says. ""The technologies are changing so rapidly and alternatives are being explored.""
At least one company has expressed interest in applying for a permit to mine the seafloor through the U.S. The Metals Company, a Canadian mining company,
said this spring
it would seek a permit from the Trump administration.

Altadena, CALIF — More than three months after 16,251 homes and other buildings were destroyed in the
Eaton
and
Palisades
fires, rebuilding has begun. Now that burned debris has been removed from lots, both Los Angeles city and county have started issuing building permits.
Among the many decisions homeowners face is whether to rebuild with all-electric appliances or re-install gas ones. California's policy is to
transition away from burning climate-warming natural gas in buildings and switching to electric
. Climate activists hope to convince homeowners to make that choice, but requiring all-electric homes of people who just had their lives upended by a wildfire is proving challenging.

Switching from gas to electric? Here are 3 appliances that are easy to install
Maestretti has questions before deciding to rebuild all-electric. He wonders where electricity powering the grid comes from and how climate-friendly it is —
federal data for 2023 show
about 60% of the state's electricity came from zero-carbon sources. He also wants more information about the benefits of switching to electricity and what it's like to adapt to that change.
""I have questions, naturally, and it's too soon for me to be making decisions about this right now,"" Maestretti says. He's working with a building contractor, still needs to clear burned debris from his lot, all while continuing to run his business. The question of whether he'll install gas in his new home is just one of many issues he'll need to decide in the coming months.
Electricity mandate or choice?
Almost a third
of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from buildings — much of it from burning natural gas in appliances. That's why
electrification is a key climate solution
. The idea is to switch from climate-warming methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, to electric appliances and heaters powered by an
increasingly cleaner grid
.
Organizations concerned about climate change are pushing Los Angeles policy-makers to rebuild without gas. A few of them created a coalition called
Rebuild LA S.A.F.E.

speed permits for people who choose all electric
in their rebuilt homes.
A sign that reads ""Altadena is not for sale"" is seen in a burned down lot. According to Altadena resident Lupe Sanchez signs like this are up ""Because in the beginning — like the second, third day that we were up here — there were all kinds of investors and real estate people coming in and telling us that they were going to give us that money for ours — our area, our property.

His family also lost their home in the Palisades wildfire. ""Our house was a total loss.

Instead, the groups hope to convince as many as possible to choose only electricity. Bradley says this is an easier argument to make if homeowners had already been thinking about getting rid of gas before the fires.
Switching from gas to electric requires planning
Jaime Rodriguez lived in his Altadena home for two-and-a-half years before the Eaton Fire destroyed it.

an air-tight building style
with plenty of insulation that reduces the home's energy consumption.
Rodriguez started converting gas appliances to electric ones before the fire. He replaced a gas furnace with a more efficient heat pump and says that's saved him money. He looks forward to cooking with an electric induction stove, which uses magnetism to heat food, and
avoids some of the health concerns

""Many of these homeowners have never built a house — never intended to build a house. And now they find themselves having to make thousands of individual decisions that they never thought they would have to make,"" says Beckie Menten, California director for the coalition.
One of their more compelling arguments is that electrification can save money.
""We estimate that you can save somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000 [in construction and appliance costs], by building an all electric home as opposed to a dual-fuel home,"" she says. That argument was recently bolstered by
a report from the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment
at University of California Berkeley.
Among the potential savings, a house rebuilt with only electric appliances doesn't need new gas pipes installed throughout the home. That can save on construction costs, Menten says.
The local gas utility, SoCalGas, did not respond to NPR's interview request. Instead, it offered a statement of support for its customers who are rebuilding. The utility says on its
fire website
that about half the 30,300 customers initially affected by the fires have had their service restored.
Climate groups hope to convince the remaining customers to give up gas and choose electric appliances instead.

Air in the U.S. has gotten cleaner for decades, adding years to people's lives and preventing millions of asthma attacks, but nearly half of Americans still live with unhealthy air pollution, a new report finds.
The report comes as the Trump administration is considering rolling back some key air quality regulations.
Air quality across the country has improved dramatically since regulations like the Clean Air Act were put in place in the 1970s to govern sources of pollution like coal-fired power plants and emissions from diesel trucks. Despite that progress, the air is still unhealthy and polluted in many parts of the country. In 2023, nearly half of the country's inhabitants — 156 million people — lived in places heavy in smog or soot pollution that harms their lungs, hearts, and brains, according to the newest edition of the American Lung Association's
State of the Air report
.

The Undercount: The invisible death toll from climate change
Wildfire smoke contributes to thousands of deaths each year in the U.S.
""Both these types of pollution cause people to die. They shorten life expectancy and drive increases in asthma rates,"" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist at Harvard University.
Pollution levels vary widely across the country, the report finds, with the worst soot pollution, averaged over the whole year, centered on California cities like Fresno and Bakersfield. Ozone pollution is highest in the Los Angeles region. Phoenix, Arizona, and Dallas, Texas, also rank in the top 10 most smog-heavy cities. Nationwide, people of color are about twice as likely to live somewhere with high soot and ozone pollution as white Americans.
The report, now in its 26th year, comes as the Trump administration pushes federal agencies to reconsider many of the regulations that have resulted in cleaner air in recent decades.  Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin has announced his intention to re-evaluate
limits on soot pollution
, which were last tightened in 2024, claiming the tighter rules restrict
business activity
. The EPA has granted
exemption
s on emissions reduction requirements to dozens of coal-fired power plants, which produce some of the most health-harming particle pollution.
Doctors and health experts have expressed alarm at the proposed changes.

Air pollution used to be much worse
In October of 1948, a thick, choking smog settled over the small Pennsylvania town of Donora.
The town was home to two steel plants. Pollution from those plants, like
hydrogen fluoride
and
sulfur dioxide
, lingered near ground level for five days. The pollution morphed into a thick, acidic mix that sickened nearly half the town's residents.
In the months and years after the smog lifted, scientists figured out that breathing in pollutants from the smog worsened people's respiratory problems and contributed to 20 deaths. Air pollution, they concluded, was far more dangerous than previously thought.
Heavy smog blanketed Piccadilly Circus in London, in December 1952. The smog, driven by air pollution from burning coal and unlucky weather conditions, caused thousands of deaths and catalyzed action toward cleaning up sources of pollution. A similar event in the U.S. a few years earlier highlighted the dangers of air pollution on human health.

The incident, along with smog that regularly blanketed cities like Los Angeles, pushed the federal government to develop the
Clean Air Act
, which was first implemented in 1963 and then updated significantly in 1970 and several times since. The law focused on lowering levels of several pollutants known to harm human health: particulate matter (also known as particle pollution), ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.
In the years since, study after study has found profound health improvements linked to better air quality.
""The Clean Air Act is one of the greatest success stories in our country,"" says Rice.
The law requires that the EPA revisit the science every five years, reassessing what health researchers have learned about the risks of breathing in poor air and adjusting the regulations accordingly.
""So the air quality standards have kept pace with the science over time, and levels of fine particulate matter have declined over the last 50-plus years,"" Rice says. ""As a result, life expectancy is longer, and asthma rates have gone down.""

EPA's newly tightened air pollution rules are welcome news in polluted places
One landmark study informing the regulations spanned 20 years. The
Six Cities study
, led by researchers from Harvard University, followed about 8,000 people who lived in six different U.S. cities—some heavily polluted, like Steubenville, Ohio, and others where air pollution was mild, like Portage, Wisconsin.
The scientists measured people's lung physiology at the start of the study and checked in with the participants every year.
""We were not just going into a community, but going into people's homes,"" says Douglas Dockery, one of the leaders of the study and an emeritus professor at Harvard. ""It was real shoe-leather epidemiology."" They kept track of those who died and of what causes over 20 years.

The results, which they published in 1993, were unambiguous.
""People in dirtier communities died sooner than people in clean places,"" says C. Arden Pope, a researcher at Brigham Young University and another author of the study — about two years earlier than a similar person in the cleaner cities.
The magnitude of the impact was so large that ""we almost didn't believe it,"" Pope says. In fact, a study published around the same time had investigated the impact on life expectancy from a much more familiar killer: cancer.
""And here we were, saying that the effects of air pollution in the six communities we studied was about that big,"" Pope says.
To check the results, Pope led a follow-up study that analyzed health outcomes for more than 500,000 people across the country, in more than 150 cities.
That analysis
came to the same conclusion: air pollution shortened people's lives significantly.
What Pope found particularly striking was that pollution levels in all six of the original cities studied didn't exceed the pollution limits that existed at the time — yet even at those allegedly ""safe"" levels, people's lives were being prematurely shortened. The outcomes showed that the rules weren't yet tight enough to protect people's health, Pope says.
The new research kicked off an effort to strengthen pollution rules. After the two studies were published, the American Lung Association pushed the EPA to tighten the
standard for particle pollution
.
Now scientists also know
how
air pollution harms the body
Scientists have also explored how and why different types of air pollution harm health.
Some particles, for example, are so small they can be inhaled deep into people's lungs, where they irritate the organ's delicate lining and trigger respiratory problems, from asthma to COPD.
But the problems don't stop in the lungs. The tiniest particles can pass through the lungs' barriers and slip into the bloodstream — ""and from there, anywhere,"" says Tummula. ""They contribute to a lot of inflammation within the bloodstream—but can also disrupt plaque within the arteries,"" she says.

Recent research has also found that air pollution directly impacts the brain. Higher exposure to particle pollution is linked to ""problems with cognition and brain function,"" says Wilson. Exposure to high pollution can disrupt children's learning and hasten the onset of
brain problems like dementia
.
Pollution dropped for decades — but progress is slowing
Since the Clean Air Act first passed, air pollution has dropped by nearly 80% across the country, according to this year's State of the Air report.
Cleaner air keeps 2.4 million asthma attacks from happening every year, says Tummula.
""These are each a person we're talking about,"" she says — 2.4 million people every year who can go to school or a full day of work without being interrupted by a health problem.

The improvements progressed steadily for years, with soot pollution levels dropping about 40% since 2000, when the SoTA report began its annual roundup.
But recently, some of those improvements have plateaued.
One major factor, the report says, are climate change-intensified wildfires, which have started burning bigger areas and more intensely. The smoke they produce now impacts parts of the county that historically had little experience with it, like the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Fine particle pollution from wildfire smoke has now eroded about a quarter of air quality improvements since 2000, according to a study
published in 2023
.
Climate change is complicating the fight against air pollution in other ways, too, says Rice. For example, ozone, the primary component in smog, forms more readily in hot, sunny weather, and climate change is bringing more hot days to the U.S.
A more immediate concern, Rice says, may come from changes in the federal government as the Trump administration makes efforts to cut staffing and spending. Scientists and technicians at the EPA monitor the air and study the health effects of different pollutants. Their work contributes to how regulations on pollution are updated. EPA leaders have proposed eliminating the agency office that performs that research. That would be a ""terrible mistake,"" Rice says.

where
incomes are well below

Then President Trump took office, and the aid disappeared.
At the end of March, the Environmental Protection Agency told Vlaun that a grant to his organization had been terminated. ""The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,"" the agency said in a letter that was shared with NPR.
It's one of scores of funding agreements Congress earlier approved for climate and environmental initiatives that have been

. Environmental justice projects like Vlaun's, which are aimed at helping low-income and disadvantaged communities, have been hit especially hard.
Federal judges have intervened, ordering the Trump administration to release promised funds. A lot of the legal arguments so far have revolved around whether the administration violated federal regulations and the Constitution's separation of powers when it withheld money that Congress appropriated.
But a
lawsuit filed recently in federal court in South Carolina
goes further. A group of nonprofits and municipalities alleges the Trump administration violated their free-speech rights by targeting them over language in their grant documents, including words like ""equity"" and ""socioeconomic,"" and trying to force them to use different language. They're not alone: Harvard University

""You can't use government funding to coerce speech,"" says Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represents nonprofits in the South Carolina lawsuit.
Vlaun says he's talked to some national organizations about potentially joining litigation against the Trump administration. His nonprofit is trying to push ahead with its work in Maine at the same time it looks for ways to make up an $85,000 budget deficit that was created when the EPA grant disappeared.
""We're working to support the most vulnerable people in our communities,"" Vlaun says. ""And when you use words like equity, energy equity or something, all of a sudden you're on a blacklist. That just seems bizarre to me.""
The EPA said in a statement that it doesn't comment on pending litigation. The agency has previously said it is ""reviewing its grant funding to ensure it is appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities.""
The departments of Agriculture, Energy and Transportation, which are also named as defendants in the South Carolina lawsuit, didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

'People got their hopes up, and then it went away.'
Trump has vowed to shrink the federal bureaucracy and slash government spending. One focus is initiatives to deal with climate change and environmental threats. As federal funding ground to a halt in recent months, projects ranging from removing lead paint and pipes to cleaning up contaminated land and monitoring pollution were jeopardized.
Grant recipients and activists say the sweeping move to withhold funding threatens the government's reputation as a reliable partner, whether it's to protect human health and the environment or to build big infrastructure projects.
""The market despises uncertainty,"" says Beth Bafford, chief executive of Climate United, an investment fund that's
suing to stop the EPA
from revoking grant funding the agency awarded under the Biden administration. ""And so, the instability and uncertainty is not only going to impact what we can do today, but it's certainly going to impact the types of investments our country can make, what we can build, over the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.""

As part of its rollback of Biden-era initiatives, the Trump administration is targeting programs aimed at helping poor communities like
Louisiana's Cancer Alley
that have been disproportionately exposed to pollution from things like refineries and chemical plants.
On his first day in office, Trump
revoked an executive order issued by former President Biden
that directed agencies to consider the effects of federal policies and programs on ""communities with environmental justice concerns."" Weeks later, the
Office of the Attorney General said
that to ensure the ""even-handed administration of justice,"" it was rescinding a 2022 memo that prioritized the enforcement of environmental laws in ""overburdened and underserved communities."" And in March, the
EPA said it was eliminating
part of the agency that focused on environmental justice, which Administrator Lee Zeldin called ""an excuse to fund left-wing activists.""
The effort to purge environmental justice programs has extended to grant funding that Congress authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which were signed by former President Biden.
The Sierra Club obtained a list of EPA grants marked as terminated as of early March. Many on the list, which was shared with NPR, were for environmental justice projects, including one grant that supported initiatives such as flood mitigation in southwest Virginia, a
deep red part of the commonwealth
where communities have been shaped by the coal industry's booms and busts.
""The projects that we were doing are deeply rooted in community support,"" says Emma Kelly, a new economy program coordinator at Appalachian Voices. She adds, ""People got their hopes up, and then it went away.""

EPA flagged a 'list of words to avoid' in grant documents
In South Carolina, a nonprofit called The Sustainability Institute received an EPA grant to build new energy-efficient homes, and to repair, weatherize and upgrade existing houses in a historically black community split decades ago by the construction of a highway. After Trump was elected,
the grant was repeatedly frozen and unfrozen
, throwing the project into disarray.
Sponsor Message
In late March, an EPA employee
emailed the head of The Sustainability Institute
about the project, according to a court filing in the federal lawsuit in South Carolina. Attached to the email was a document the EPA employee referred to as a ""list of words to avoid,"" and another the employee called a ""Sanitized Workplan.""
Included in the court filing is a list of words such as ""cultural differences,"" ""discrimination"" and ""marginalized."" The filing also includes a description of the project in which certain words and phrases are highlighted, such as ""disadvantaged,"" ""predominantly Black neighborhood,"" and ""sea level rise."" A third document titled ""Decision Tree"" appears to direct government employees to flag grant documents containing keywords that may conflict with Trump's executive orders.
Discussions that The Sustainability Institute has had with the EPA about its grant funding demonstrate that the government has tried to pressure the nonprofit into using language that's acceptable to the administration, says Meyer of the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represents The Sustainability Institute in the federal lawsuit.
""The administration might try to pretend like, oh, well, we just have different priorities, and that's why we're moving the money around. But the facts show that that's not true,"" Meyer says. ""Because what they're saying to this group is, 'Oh, it's probably fine for you to spend this money on this affordable housing in Charleston as planned, but we want you to talk about it differently.' And that isn't something that the government can do.""
Meyer adds: ""Congress has said this [funding] is for environmental justice work in disadvantaged communities. It doesn't matter if that's a priority for the Trump administration. That's how this money has to be spent.""
The power the executive branch can wield over federal spending is being debated in a number of lawsuits. In two separate orders last week, federal judges in
Rhode Island
and the
District of Columbia
said agencies do have some power to terminate individual grants, but that they still have to comply with the law and applicable regulations. In the case of the Trump administration's broad funding freeze, the judges said federal agencies appear to have acted arbitrarily and capriciously.

In the South Carolina lawsuit, lawyers for the nonprofits and municipalities suing the Trump administration filed with the court
a copy of a March email
in which an employee of the EPA's Office of General Counsel acknowledged that the decision to cancel environmental justice grants was made with the knowledge that some of the grants didn't contain terms and conditions ""about termination for agency priorities.""
""The courts want to be crystal clear: elections have consequences and the President is entitled to enact his agenda,"" Judge Mary McElroy of the federal court for the District of Rhode Island, whom Trump appointed during his first term, wrote in an April 15 order directing the administration to unfreeze grant funding while a lawsuit filed by a group of nonprofits plays out. However, McElroy said federal agencies don't have ""unlimited authority to further a President's agenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity"" laws that Congress passed during the previous administration.
In New Haven, Conn., another plaintiff in the South Carolina lawsuit, the EPA cancelled an environmental justice grant that would have helped city residents swap out old oil-burning heating systems for more efficient heat pumps.
""There's really no potential here for waste, fraud and abuse, and I struggle to see, in any sense, how helping struggling residents transition to cleaner, lower-cost heating systems conflicts with merit and fairness,"" Steven Winter, New Haven's executive director of climate and sustainability, says, citing rationales the EPA provided in the termination letter.
""We went into this project with a lens of focusing on neighborhoods with the highest rates of air pollution and associated health issues,"" Winter says, and on ""residents who are struggling the most with their utility bills.""
At stake in lawsuits like the one in South Carolina is the concept of ""viewpoint neutrality,"" which is a ""bedrock principle underlying our First Amendment,"" says Nadine Strossen, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression who is not involved in the lawsuit.

""Even though you do not have a right to receive federal funding,"" Strossen says, the government can't ""deny the funding or remove the funding because of disagreement with the viewpoint or the ideas or the perspectives of the grantee.""
Harvard raised a similar argument in
a lawsuit it filed

freezing billions in grants and contracts

""The freeze and the looming threat of additional funding cuts will chill Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights,"" the university

First Amendment scholars see evidence the government is trying to punish groups for their views
Genevieve Lakier, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, says it seems the Trump administration is trying to ""purify"" the federal government ideologically, in part by defunding initiatives that reflect views and beliefs that are at odds with the administration's.
""I think that that effort, because it is viewpoint-based, is inconsistent with large parts of the spirit of the First Amendment,"" Lakier says. She adds, however, that it could be tricky to prove the administration is violating people's free-speech rights by targeting things like climate and environmental grants.
For example, Lakier says the government could try to argue that grant-funded projects involving activities like replacing heating systems in low-income housing don't have anything to do with free speech.

But Lakier says the chart cited in the South Carolina lawsuit that appears to direct government employees to flag grant documents that contain certain language is ""good evidence that there's a viewpoint-based motive, that they're punishing these organizations because of their viewpoints.""
Previously, Lakier and Strossen both
argued in support
of the National Rifle Association when the group
claimed its free-speech rights had been violated
by a New York state official who allegedly pressured banks and insurance companies to blacklist the NRA following a deadly shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.
""No matter who you are and no matter what your most important beliefs are, there will be a time and a government official and perhaps a majority of people in your community who will strongly disapprove of your viewpoint,"" Strossen says. ""And you will be so grateful that the viewpoint neutrality principle will prevent that government official from directly or indirectly silencing, punishing or chilling your cherished expression of your favored beliefs.""
In Maine, Vlaun says actions the Trump administration has taken over the past few months have sent a chill through climate activists. Some are afraid they'll face retaliation if they speak out, he says.
""You wonder where it's all going to stop,"" Vlaun says. ""I mean, to talk about environmental justice and to talk about, you know, people that are vulnerable to climate change and trying to help them and being vilified for that, it's just kind of — I don't know, I can't think about it too much, because it just, it kind of makes you crazy."""

In addition to being the spiritual leader of about
1.4 billion Catholics
, Pope Francis advocated for taking action on climate change. That's not surprising for a pontiff who was the first to take the name of St. Francis of Assisi,
the patron saint of animals and ecology
.
Over his 12 years as the head of the Catholic Church, Francis repeatedly raised the problem of human-caused global heating from burning fossil fuels and he encouraged people—including world leaders—to do something about it.
His 2015 encyclical brought an influential voice into the global discussion, just as leaders were finalizing an important agreement in Paris, which aimed to address the problem. And as humans continued to heat the planet with pollution from fossil fuels, Francis' missives became progressively more urgent. Researchers felt these writings boosted Francis' prominence as a climate advocate, though they appear to have largely failed to change people's minds about climate change. Still supporters say he brought together science, morality and faith in new ways for his church.

""It was the first encyclical of its kind to look at the relationship between humans and God, as well as humans and the natural world, and to link these types of relationship as matters of faith,"" says Christiana Zenner, associate professor of theology, science and ethics at Fordham University.
And he did that in ways that prompted people across the globe to pay attention to what is happening as the planet continues to heat up.

'Laudato si' launches a global Catholic climate movement
Environmental protection was a consistent theme in Francis' papacy and he often combined that with calls to protect the most vulnerable people. In
his inaugural 2013 homily
he discussed what it meant to be a protector, ""It means respecting each of God's creatures and respecting the environment in which we live.""
In 2015 Pope Francis issued a
papal letter—or encyclical —titled Laudato Si'
. It recognized climate change as a global problem with significant consequences, especially for the poor. He criticized developed countries, like the United States and China, which have
contributed the most planet-heating pollution
. Francis reserved his most severe criticism for the ""wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels.""
Sponsor Message
In one particularly blunt section, he criticized accumulating pollution that is ""non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive"" and said, ""The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.""
Francis said poorer nations, which have contributed the least to climate pollution, should get help from developed countries ""to support policies and programmes of sustainable development.""
That echoes a major element of the
Paris Agreement
, which then-President Obama and other world leaders agreed to later that year. Under the climate accord, developed countries help developing countries pay the costs of building their economies with resources that won't heat up the planet even more.
Climate
Exclusive: Climate activists were hacked. There was a link between victims and an alleged attacker
Francis' climate encyclical inspired several Catholic climate groups to form, including The Global Catholic Climate Movement, which is now called the
Laudato Si' Movement
.
""All around the world, you saw all of these people reading the encyclical, writing letters to the editor, posting on social media, forming discussion groups in their parishes,"" says Rebecca Elliott, senior director for strategy and special projects at Laudato Si' Movement.
The nonprofit group says it has worked in 140 countries and trained about 20,000 community leaders it calls ""animators,"" people who put into practice the ideas Francis has advocated. ""They're educating the next generation in care for creation. They're planting trees. They're holding litter cleanups. They're doing mobilizations and marches to advocate for better policies,"" Elliott says.
Elliott says the pope's climate encyclical had ripple effects across the globe, including Latin America. Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina and is the first pope from the Americas and the southern hemisphere.
Elliott credits Francis' climate advocacy in getting Catholic bishops to campaign to pass a
2023 referendum in Ecuador that blocked oil drilling in Yasuní National Park
, an Amazon rainforest designated a
UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1989
.
""The Catholic Church stood alongside Indigenous leaders, young people and others to support the referendum to stop oil extraction in Yasuni National Park,"" Elliott says.

Francis' climate message became increasingly urgent
As
scientists warned that human-caused climate change is disrupting nature and hurting people
, Pope Francis matched that urgency in his own messages.
In a
2021 BBC broadcast
, before the U.N. climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, Francis mentioned climate change in a list of crises that included the COVID-19 pandemic and economic difficulties. As
NPR reported
, ""the pope called on the U.N. to take 'radical decisions' to safeguard the environment and to place global concerns over the interests of individual nations.""
In 2023 he also revisited the topic of climate change with another major papal document
Laudate Deum
, which is about one-fifth the length of his more than 38,000-word Laudato Si', and it focused directly on climate change.
""He is evidently annoyed that much of humanity seems to have missed the message,"" Zenner, the Fordham professor, says.
Francis addresses this ""climate crisis"" message to ""my brothers and sisters of our suffering planet"" and says ""with the passage of time, I have realized that our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.""
""He does seem crankier,"" Zenner says, comparing the 2023 missive to Francis' first climate encyclical. ""I think that's something that people respond to in Pope Francis as well — is that he's emotional in a very humanly relatable way.""

Zenner says Francis' climate advocacy will likely endure because he was focused on changing hearts, as well as minds.
""I think that the Catholic Church now has to be seen as an entity that is concerned about care for creation and people's faith lives together. I don't think that can be erased,"" says Zenner.

Preaching to the converted
In the wake of Francis' 2015 encyclical, researchers wondered if there would be a ""Francis effect"" on Americans' views on climate change.
Early research showed
more Americans said they were worried about climate change than before the pope's letter, but
later research
found that change was short lived and affected by a person's political views.
There also were expectations that Pope Francis expressing his views on climate change could be a ""
turning point
"" and might encourage skeptics to reconsider their positions. In 2017
Francis gave a copy of his 2015 climate encyclical
to President Trump, who visited him at the Vatican during his first term. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,
expressed hope that if Trump read the document
, it would change his mind on withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.

once again withdrawing the U.S.
After Francis' 2015 encyclical, researchers examined a broad range of views, well beyond the President.
""What we found was that the pope did not change people's minds about climate change. The pope changed people's minds about himself,"" says Asheley Landrum, associate professor of science communication and media psychology at Arizona State University.
Landrum's
research shows
that political conservatives responded less favorably than liberals to the pope's message. She says the problem may be that Francis was
preaching to the converted
and ignoring the kinds of messages a conservative audience would be more likely to accept.
Sponsor Message
""You have to think about the values and the beliefs and the concerns that your audience has and tell them why your message is consistent with those values and concerns,"" Landrum says. Instead, the pope mixed discussion of climate change with his criticism of wealthy countries and people ""making himself look like an outgroup member to people like Donald Trump and to Rick Santorum and to Jeb Bush and other politically conservative Catholics who really did just reject his message at the time.""
Landrum says Francis likely will be remembered as an ""advocate for climate change"" and as ""an environmental pope."" While he may not have changed many conservative minds, she says, ""I think that he did plant a flag, and to say that climate change mitigation is consistent with socially conservative values and with Catholic values."""

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has ordered a halt to an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Today, Equinor, the Norwegian energy company that owns and operates the project,
announced it is complying with the order and suspending all construction
.
President Trump, a longtime critic of wind energy, issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects, one of his first
executive orders
upon returning to the White House.
Sponsor Message
Climate
Here's how Trump's pause on wind projects could threaten jobs and climate goals
But Burgum's decision escalates the Administration's opposition to offshore wind because the multi-billion dollar project in New York already had its federal permits and had broken ground, says
Robert Freudenberg
,  a vice president at the Regional Plan Association, an energy nonprofit in the New York metropolitan area.
""This really is next level offshore wind aggression,"" Freudenberg says.
The offshore wind project, called Empire Wind 1, was supposed to supply power to
500,000 homes in New York
. The federal lease for the project was signed during the first Trump administration in 2017. Much of the
federal permitting
for this project happened during the Biden administration.
In
a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
(BOEM), the lead federal agency for permitting offshore wind projects, Burgum wrote that ""approval for the project was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""
The letter did not give details about the alleged rush. The Interior Department did not respond to NPR's request for comment. The idea that the review of this wind project was rushed is not supported by evidence, says
Matthew Eisenson
, senior fellow at Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
""BOEM spent two and a half years conducting an environmental review. The final product of that environmental review is an environmental impact statement that's over 3000 pages long, with all of its appendices, and it's very thorough,"" Eisenson says. "" This rationale, it's very suspect.""

""So there's no universe in which the GAO report would be used to substantiate the stop work order for Empire Wind 1,"" says
Kris Ohleth
, executive director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a wind policy think tank.
The U.S. clean-energy industry is on pace for
record growth this year
. Wind energy makes up
about 10%
of the U.S. electricity mix — the largest single source of renewable energy.
But while the offshore wind industry was expecting to see important new projects this year like the
Vineyard Wind 1
project in Massachusetts and the
Revolution Wind
project in Rhode Island, Ohleth says all offshore wind projects are now in jeopardy.
""It should send alarm bells, not just to the offshore wind industry, but to industries beyond offshore wind,"" Freudenberg says, ""that the federal government could choose to stop projects that had been approved and are underway at their whim.""
The halting of Empire Wind 1 disrupts a much-needed electricity supply to a region with growing power demands for things like data centers, says Kit Kennedy,  managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "" This is the kind of energy dominance that the U.S. needs. That the Trump administration should be supporting,"" she says.
New York has a goal of developing
9,000 megawatts in offshore wind energy

For years, the U.S. Justice Department has worked to unravel
a global hacking campaign
that targeted prominent American climate activists. Now, public tax filings reviewed by NPR reveal an unexpected link between the company that allegedly commissioned the attacks and some of the victims.
The connection emerges as another element in the complex story of how hackers were allegedly hired to attack parts of American civil society. The Justice Department investigation has focused recently on an Israeli private investigator named Amit Forlit whom federal prosecutors are trying to extradite from the United Kingdom for allegedly orchestrating the hacking. Prosecutors say the operation was aimed at gathering information to foil lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry over damage communities have faced from climate change.
Sponsor Message
Buried in the investigation's court filings are the names of one of the world's biggest publicly-traded oil companies and one of its longtime lobbyists: ExxonMobil and DCI Group. In an affidavit filed in the UK, a federal prosecutor identifies DCI as the firm that allegedly commissioned the hacking.
DCI was working for ExxonMobil when the attacks allegedly started around early 2016, according to federal lobbying records and Justice Department legal filings. At the same time, DCI was also consulting for New Venture Fund, a nonprofit known for working on progressive causes, including reducing the use of fossil fuels,
according to tax filings
NPR reviewed. During that period when DCI worked for both ExxonMobil and New Venture Fund, a senior advisor at the nonprofit was working with climate activists targeted by the alleged hacking operation.
Legal experts and researchers who track Washington's influence industry told NPR the relationship between DCI and New Venture Fund raises questions about what role that connection might have played in the alleged targeting of climate activists. Analysts at The Citizen Lab, a cyber watchdog at the University of Toronto,
said in a report about the attacks
that they were carefully tailored, suggesting hackers had a ""highly detailed and accurate understanding"" of the climate activists and their relationships.
Sponsor Message
""What you have unearthed is certainly a step investigators would want to look at,"" Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former federal prosecutor, told NPR about the link between DCI and New Venture Fund.
In criminal cases, investigators map out relationships between individuals and organizations using things like financial transactions, phone records and tax filings, McQuade says. ""When you layer them along with dates, sometimes you can find interesting patterns,"" she says.
The Justice Department didn't respond to a message seeking comment.
A DCI executive, Craig Stevens, declined to comment. Stevens previously told NPR that no one at the firm has been questioned by the U.S. government as part of the hacking investigation. ""Allegations of DCI's involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false and unsubstantiated. We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law,"" Stevens said. ""Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities.""
ExxonMobil referred to a previous statement in which the company told NPR it has not been ""involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" The company
has said it has repeatedly acknowledged
""climate change is real, and we have an entire business dedicated to reducing emissions.""
New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner told NPR that DCI worked on a project housed at the nonprofit that promoted education reform and
Common Core
state education standards with Republicans. Bodner says DCI wouldn't have had access to New Venture Fund's internal computer systems.
Climate activists protest on the first day of an ExxonMobil trial outside the New York State Supreme Court building in 2019 in New York City. Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court ultimately found that the New York Attorney General's Office failed to prove that ExxonMobil broke the law.

Hacking victim says the attacks felt like 'Big Brother had arrived'
The hacking operation against climate activists fits
a widespread pattern
in which companies and wealthy individuals use private investigators to conduct cyberespionage against opponents, often to discredit them in legal disputes.
Sponsor Message
As part of the Justice Department's long-running investigation into the hacking, an Israeli private investigator named Aviram Azari was
sentenced to prison in the U.S.
in late 2023 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Azari hired hackers who targeted American climate activists, as well as government officials in Africa, members of a Mexican political party and critics of a German company called Wirecard, according to federal prosecutors.
In a
sentencing memo
for Azari, prosecutors singled out ExxonMobil, saying the company used news stories based on information stolen from activists as part of its defense against state climate investigations. Prosecutors didn't accuse ExxonMobil or DCI of wrongdoing in that case.
""It felt like Big Brother had arrived,"" and ""citizens opposing powerful interests have their communications surveilled,"" Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund,
said at Azari's 2023 sentencing hearing
in Manhattan. Wasserman was among those targeted by the hacking.
Months later, in early 2024, Amit Forlit, a business associate of Azari's, was arrested under an Interpol Red Notice at London's Heathrow airport on his way to Tel Aviv. The Justice Department has charged Forlit with conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Forlit has previously denied ordering or paying for hacking.
A former officer in Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Forlit said in a sworn statement after his arrest that he owns a security and intelligence-gathering firm whose clients include law firms, lobbyists and hedge funds. Another hearing in Forlit's extradition case is scheduled for April 17 in London.
A lawyer for Forlit
said in a recent court filing
that the hacking operation her client is accused of leading ""is alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies.""

About halfway through the 30-page affidavit, the prosecutor cites emails in which ""DCI Group"" employees allegedly shared versions of a stolen memo belonging to an environmental lawyer, as well as information about people who received the memo.
NPR couldn't confirm that the Justice Department is referring to DCI every time the affidavit mentions the ""D.C. lobbying firm."" However, the Justice Department only cites one lobbying firm in the affidavit.
According to the affidavit, the ""D.C. lobbying firm"" started working with Forlit at least as far back as 2013.
In 2015, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly approached Forlit about targeting environmental and climate advocates, according to the affidavit. The affidavit details how the Justice Department alleges the hacking operation worked:
The D.C. lobbying firm allegedly identified people and organizations it wanted to discredit as part of its work for the Texas oil company;
Forlit or a co-conspirator allegedly gave Azari lists of people or accounts that were of interest to the D.C. lobbying firm;
Azari then allegedly hired hackers to target the climate activists;
Later, the lobbying firm allegedly shared with the oil company private documents — or versions of documents —  that were ""likely obtained through the successful hacking,"" according to the prosecutor's affidavit.
Soon after, the private documents appeared in media reports that were ""designed to undermine the integrity of the civil investigations"" into the oil company, the Justice Department alleges. The affidavit claims the oil company then ""relied on the published articles about the stolen and leaked documents"" in court filings to fight litigation.
DCI lobbied for ExxonMobil for about a decade,
according to federal lobbying records
. ExxonMobil
was based in Irving, Texas
, until mid-2023. Forlit's lawyer, Rachel Scott, said in a January court filing in London that the U.S. is trying to prosecute Forlit in part ""to advance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.""

ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies face dozens of climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. The lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The U.S. government is not part of the litigation. The fossil fuel industry says the lawsuits are meritless and politicized, and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

A private meeting among climate activists gets exposed in the press
In the affidavit, the Justice Department said the first example of alleged hacking of documents and leaking to the media came in 2016.
Early that year, Kenny Bruno, an environmental advocate, emailed an agenda for a closed-door strategy meeting to a group of climate activists. They planned to gather at the Manhattan office of the Rockefeller Family Fund, a philanthropy that supports initiatives to address climate change, inequality and threats to democracy. At the time, the fossil-fuel industry was under growing pressure as
Democratic politicians urged
the Justice Department to investigate
whether ExxonMobil had misled the public
about climate change. Climate activists were to meet at the Rockefeller office to hone their attacks on the company,
according to the meeting agenda
.
When Bruno emailed the agenda in January 2016, he and DCI were both working with the non-profit New Venture Fund, NPR has found in tax filings and documents related to the U.S. hacking investigation. The prosecutor's affidavit says that about a month after Bruno sent the email, around February 2016, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm gave copies of the email to the firm's client, the unnamed Texas oil company.
NPR hasn't been able to find any evidence of how the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly got copies of the email with the agenda. Forlit's team was also asked around that time to dig up information about the activists who received Bruno's email, according to the Justice Department affidavit.

The agenda for the Rockefeller meeting then
surfaced
in
media
reports in April 2016.
ExxonMobil
and
Republican lawmakers
cited the document as they battled state climate investigations, saying activists and state prosecutors colluded to advance a political agenda.
Bruno says he didn't know DCI was a consultant for New Venture Fund at the same time he was there. He says he was working on a project housed at the nonprofit to limit oil production from
Canadian tar sands
. ""I had no interaction with them,"" he says.
""If DCI was involved, they wouldn't have [had] access through their work with New Venture Fund,"" says Bodner, the nonprofit's president. Bodner adds: ""Our [computer] systems didn't house that kind of sensitive project communication that would have been of most interest to the hackers.""
As a so-called
fiscal sponsor
, New Venture Fund provides administrative, legal and accounting support for the projects that it hosts. New Venture Fund was the fiscal sponsor for the projects that Bruno and DCI, respectively, were working on when climate activists were targeted by hackers.
The leak of the Rockefeller agenda wasn't the only time private communications between environmental advocates appeared in the media in an apparent effort to shape public opinion.
In another example cited by the Justice Department, the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly obtained a private memo belonging to an environmental lawyer as early as March 2016. Around that time, an executive at the lobbying firm gave a copy of the document to the oil company, according to the prosecutor's affidavit.
It's in this portion of the affidavit where the anonymization of the D.C. lobbying firm lapses. The affidavit states that a version of the private memo was then emailed between ""DCI Group"" employees shortly before it was
published in a news report
in 2017. On the day the article was published, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm emailed it to colleagues, the prosecutor's affidavit against Forlit alleges. The subject line of the email was ""BOOM.""
Sponsor Message
When the FBI interviewed Forlit a few years later, in the U.S. Embassy in London in 2021, they discussed his ""connections with DCI,"" Forlit said in a sworn statement that was filed as part of his extradition case.
Kert Davies, director of special investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity and a target of the hacking, says DCI was instrumental in public relations work that helped ExxonMobil and others in the fossil-fuel industry fight efforts to cut heat-trapping emissions while politicizing the issue of climate change among voters.
The industry ""sought division and debate to slow the policy wheel from turning,"" Davies says.
Firefighters watch a helicopter drop water on the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon in Los Angeles in January 2025. California sued oil and gas companies in 2023 for allegedly misleading the public about the dangers of fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of climate change. The fossil fuel industry says lawsuits like California's are meritless and politicized.

DCI executive said the firm is hired 'when the stakes are the highest'
Analysts at The Citizen Lab, the cyber watchdog group,
said in a report several years ago that the attacks
on climate activists were ""well-informed."" Hackers targeted campaigners and their family members with what are known as ""phishing emails,"" which are used to gain access to sensitive information through impersonation or other deceptive means. Some of the messages seemed to refer to confidential documents related to ExxonMobil, The Citizen Lab said, while others impersonated people who were involved in lawsuits against the oil company.
That suggests hackers ""had a deep knowledge of informal organizational hierarchies"" among the climate activists, The Citizen Lab said. ""Some of this knowledge would likely have been hard to obtain from [publicly-available information] alone.""
The Citizen Lab report didn't mention Forlit or DCI, and it didn't draw conclusions about who may have commissioned the hacking. NPR hasn't been able to find evidence that DCI obtained any non-public information about climate activists through its work with New Venture Fund.
DCI has longstanding ties to the fossil fuel industry. In the early 2000s, ExxonMobil provided funding for a website DCI published called Tech Central Station, which the
Union of Concerned Scientists called
a ""hybrid of quasi-journalism and lobbying."" And from 2005 until early 2016, ExxonMobil paid DCI around $3 million to lobby the federal government, according to lobbying disclosures. DCI has also worked for
a nonprofit
that supports the U.S. coal industry, and
another
that
launched a campaign
in 2017 to push back on climate lawsuits targeting the fossil fuel industry.

The
Tebughna Foundation
threw a big celebration in February after the Environmental Protection Agency awarded the nonprofit $20 million to renovate or replace 20 homes contaminated with asbestos and lead for the Native Village of Tyonek in Alaska. The project, which would also connect the homes to solar panels, aimed to upgrade houses built in the 1960s.
"" We were all just so happy about this grant that's going to literally change some people's lives,"" says Vide Kroto, the foundation's executive director.
But within a matter of weeks, the Trump administration froze the funding. When Kroto logged onto the federal payment system on March 7, the status of her grant said ""suspended.""
Sponsor Message
She wasn't alone.
More than 22 tribes and nonprofits across the country from Alaska to the Midwest, have had around $350 million in federal funding for key infrastructure projects frozen, often without notice. NPR spoke with 11 of them who say some have found out their funds were suspended when they logged onto the federal payment system in early March. Others have had their grants disappear from that system entirely. Tyonek and other villages in Alaska received no notice whatsoever.
Now tribes don't know if or when they will have funds to address the growing threats of climate change, from thawing permafrost to riverbank erosion to wildfire prevention.
That funding uncertainty, explains Kroto, has thrown projects like renovating homes, ""in limbo, but the bills are still coming in.""
The Native Village of Tyonek's project, along with others across the country, were part of nearly $1.6 billion in
community change grants
distributed by the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights under the Biden administration. The funds were flowing through the administration's signature climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act. But in March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency would end the
""Biden-Harris Administration's Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms of the agency.""
In February, the EPA put
nearly 170 employees in the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights
on paid administrative leave.

Kroto says she's been fielding calls from tribal members asking if they are on the list to have their house renovated. "" We have to tell each and every [village member] because of the current administration … all the grants across the board … have been frozen or terminated or suspended,"" Kroto says. ""And we just don't have any answers.""
Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), the federal funding system, does not determine a grant's legal status, according to Zealan Hoover, a former senior advisor at the EPA under the Biden administration.
""The system was never designed to be used in this manner (constantly toggling thousands of grants on and off).""
EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in an emailed statement, ""As with any change in Administration, the agency is reviewing each grant program to ensure it is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities. Each individual grant in the Community Change Grant program is undergoing this review.""
So for now, the status of the Community Change Grants, including those going to tribal communities, is unknown.
Improving communities
Tyonek is 40 miles south of Anchorage, accessible only by plane or barge. Many people live in multi-generational homes. Between 165 to 190 people live in Tyonek, but there are close to 1,000 Tyonek tribal members in the country. Many who grow up in the village — like Kroto — move away to neighboring cities like Anchorage or leave the state.
The community is plagued with high energy costs; people pay anywhere from $300 to $800 monthly in electricity bills, according to Kroto. So they heat their homes with wood stoves.
But weather conditions can make getting firewood nearly impossible at times. Kroto says residents resort to grabbing coal from the beach to heat their wood stoves despite the health risks. Breathing coal fumes can cause lung damage and lead to long-term health impacts.

"" Growing up, that's all you would hear is, 'I'm going to live at home, I'm going to help my people, we're gonna help make change.'"" Kroto says.
So when people are ready to return to Tyonek, ""there's no place to live and the cost of living is too high,"" she says.
Community Change Grants were some of the most flexible dollars in the federal government, according to Matthew Tejada, the former deputy assistant administrator for the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights during the Biden administration.
"" You could work on housing, you could work on transportation, you could work on food, you could work on flooding,"" says Tejada, who's now the senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""You could work on basically anything affecting your community.""
The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in northwest Oregon discovered they couldn't access nearly $20 million on March 7. The community planned to use that money to build a community center that could function as an evacuation shelter during wildfires. The facility would also have solar panels to generate power during outages and grid failures.
The center is still in the design stage, but the Grand Ronde tribes say the delay could affect the construction timeline. ""These are all things we are still trying to work through,"" the tribes' spokesperson Sara Thompson wrote in an email.
Thompson says the funds from the EPA are meant to support community initiatives in Grand Ronde and across the country. She says, ""these communities deserve answers, and we pray the federal government stands behind their commitments to these programs.""
Gussie Lord is the managing attorney of tribal partnerships program at Earthjustice, an environmental law nonprofit. She says the funding freeze and federal cuts are ""really gonna impact the people that are most in need of assistance, especially in really rural areas where there's not a lot of economic development opportunity.""

River erosion
The Native Village of Kipnuk in western Alaska was counting on nearly $20 million dollars to stabilize parts of a riverbank that has been steadily eroding due to climate change which is causing flooding. The village is losing between 10 to 28 feet every year, bringing water closer to swallowing buildings and homes.
The grant was approved just weeks before President Biden left office.
Kivalina is one of the many villages home to Alaska Natives confronting coastal erosion and storm surges as the Arctic warms from climate change. The Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion in Community Change Grants to help communities address the growing threats of climate change, from thawing permafrost to riverbank erosion to wildfire prevention.

Hundreds of people call Kipnuk home, but the ground is sinking, as permafrost thaws and flooding regularly inundates the community.
"" We are starting to see increased impacts of climate change,"" says Rayna Paul, the environmental director for the Native Village of Kipnuk.
When Kipnuk floods, ""we see fuel tanks, containers [and] some smaller buildings are washed away,"" Paul says.
Like many remote villages in Alaska, Kipnuk is not connected to the state's road system and has no running water or sewer infrastructure. Residents use honey buckets — toilets that need to be emptied manually — and sewage can contaminate Kipnuk's water supply during flooding.
Time is of the essence in Kipnuk, according to Paul. She says the riverbank stabilization project needs to be completed in three years because the river is eroding so quickly, putting homes in danger.
There's also a short construction season because the river is frozen for nearly half the year, which prevents materials from being brought in.
If the riverbank stabilization project is delayed by a year, "" that would leave us like two years to build. I don't think it could happen in two years,"" Paul says. ""So that's one of my many worries.""
Paul and others in the village wrote a letter to Alaska's congressional delegation, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as well as GOP Rep. Nick Begich.
Sullivan's office said in an email that he is assisting groups in Alaska who have had funding for projects frozen.

""On behalf of the Native Village of Kipnuk, Senator Sullivan's office is advocating for the Kipnuk project, which the EPA is currently reviewing,"" said Sullivan's spokesperson Amanda Coyne.
Coyne said the office was not aware of the Tebughna's Foundation project in Tyonek.
Former EPA senior official Hoover says because relatively few termination letters have gone out, there is a window of opportunity now for grant recipients to engage with the EPA and elected officials to  try to unlock the funding, which would help communities such as the Native Village of Kipnuk where a river is threatening a village from being washed away.
""[This] is not some woke-crazy thing,"" Hoover says. ""That is government protecting vulnerable communities.  That is government upholding its treaty obligations to native communities."""

The Trump administration is proposing deep cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, according to a draft budget proposal viewed by NPR.
The agency's budget for 2026 would be slashed by more than 25% overall from its
current level
of roughly $6 billion under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Congress. The draft cuts to NOAA's research operations and fisheries services are particularly severe.
If enacted, the cuts would ""take us back to the 1950s in terms of our scientific footing and the American people,"" says Craig McLean, a former director of NOAA's office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's research arm, whose career spanned multiple administrations.
Sponsor Message
The budget aims to eliminate OAR, cutting the budget by close to 75% from previous levels and slashing all funding for research that focuses on climate and weather. A few groups from the office, like a team that works on tornado science, would be moved to other parts of the organization. The budget would also end funding for the
many cooperative research centers
scattered across the country that contribute to climate and weather research. The proposed budget comes as the administration has already fired hundreds of NOAA employees.
It also proposes slashing the operations and personnel budget of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which manages the country's ocean fisheries, by nearly 30%, and moving the rest of the office into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — another agency entirely. It also asks for the Fisheries Service staff still with the agency to prioritize ways within its purview to ""unleash American energy.""
The proposal also aims to slim down NOAA's investment in some of its premier satellite technology, called geostationary satellites, by 44% compared to current levels. The agency currently has five in orbit, which provide much of the data critical for weather forecasts, as well as weather and climate research and coastal security. The agency was in the process of developing the next generation of its satellites, which would have included several new instruments; the next was scheduled to go into orbit in 2032. The cuts to the program will jeopardize that plan and hamper the progression of key science, according to NOAA officials familiar with the program who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Sponsor Message
The budget for the National Weather Service would remain intact.
The overall impacts of the cuts would ripple into Americans' lives, says Rep, Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. ""What NOAA does is crucial to the lifesaving weather research and services that it provides to the American people,"" she says. ""This budget will leave NOAA hollowed out and unable to perform its life-saving work."" The budget draft has not yet been finalized and could change after review.
White House Office of Management and Budget spokesperson Alexandra McCandless wrote in an email that ""no final funding decisions have been made."" The U.S. Department of Commerce didn't immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.
Project 2025 provided a preview
Many of the proposed changes echo concepts outlined in Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint organized by the Washington, DC-based Heritage Foundation think tank, a document the Trump administration has followed closely in recent months.
Project 2025 calls for NOAA to ""
be broken up and downsized
,"" keeping the pieces that many Americans are familiar with, like the National Weather Service, and dismantling many of NOAA's other offices. The proposed moves follow that rubric, such as shifting the Fisheries Service to another agency.
It also called the agency part of ""the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry"" and laid out ways NOAA's climate science research could be curtailed, some of which have been proposed in the budget document.
Decades of research by thousands of scientists in the U.S. and internationally, have linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide with a warming Earth. Human activities, like burning coal, gas and other fossil fuels, are the primary cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
Other disruptions at the agency
Earlier this week, hundreds of NOAA employees who had been fired in February, then re-hired under a court order, were once again fired. The most recent firings occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could
move forward with firing
those probationary orders, at least for now.
Sponsor Message
Cuts to probationary staff, in tandem with the proposed slashing of the research and operations budgets, could hobble the agency's ability to keep Americans safe, says Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who was among those re-fired this week. ""NOAA was already stretched thin and understaffed,"" he says. ""It's going to go from stretched thin to decimated.""
NOAA provides most of the raw data and the models that predict hurricanes, and the hurricane forecasts many Americans see on their phones or TVs are created by the agency. Hazelton says reducing the research and observation capabilities of the agency could regress hurricane forecasting capability by the equivalent of decades.
The cuts to the research wing, OAR, says former NOAA Deputy Undersecretary Mary Glackin, who served over several administrations, would ""decimate the laboratory systems and the relationship that we have with universities,"" who work in partnership with the agency on many of its climate, weather, and other research projects. The proposed changes would be ""monumental,"" she says.
NOAA provides much of the raw data required for weather forecasts via a wide array of data-collection tools, from satellites to ocean buoys to weather balloons. And its scientists run models that turn that data into useful information, like those short-term weather forecasts, seasonal outlooks and long-term looks at how climate change is affecting Earth.
The agency also includes offices that manage the billions of dollars of U.S. fishery resources, like tuna, cod, scallops and crab. Its scientists figure out how many fish can be caught in order to sustain fish populations in the long term, a task legally required by law. Interruptions to fisheries operations have resulted in the past in delays in season opening or lower annual quotas fishermen are allowed to catch.
The agency also maintains coastal maps critical to safe maritime activities.

The cuts to the climate programs, Glackin says, are shortsighted. ""If you're cutting your research, you don't care about tomorrow,"" she says. It would ""take a very long time to recover from something like that."""

New London, Conn., is an old New England port city that had its heyday about 200 years ago, in a very different economy.
""Ever since the whaling industry, it's been downhill for the city of New London,"" jokes Mayor Michael Passero. ""We went from the richest city in Connecticut to one of the poorest.""
Passero, a Democrat who has been mayor since 2015, grew up in New London. He says people have always talked about the city as full of potential, always on the cusp of something big. And now, finally, in the last few years, it's happening. New London, he says, is starting to boom.

""Just in the last five or six years, we have put buildings on lots that have been empty for 50 years,"" he says.

From a dock near downtown, he points to the centerpiece of the local wind industry: a new $310 million pier where enormous turbines are partially assembled and loaded onto boats to be installed offshore.
Between redeveloping the pier and serving as the staging ground for two of the country's first big projects, offshore wind has created hundreds of jobs and generated millions for the city and local economy.
The question is whether it will last.
President Trump

Company cancels plans to build offshore wind industry factory in Massachusetts
The stakes are high — for cities like New London, but also for much of the Northeast, which is counting on the growth of offshore wind. States in the region have
poured
a lot
of money
into getting the industry off the ground because they see it as the best way to meet increasing electricity demands and drive economic growth, while also satisfying their climate goals.
Under the Biden administration, this approach had a lot of support: Biden
viewed investments in offshore wind
as a key strategy for tackling climate change, creating jobs and boosting domestic manufacturing. The administration worked to make the permitting process for projects in federal waters
faster and more efficient
, and it supported
lucrative tax credits
in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to help wind developers build projects and entice manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S.

Trump wants states to handle disasters. States aren't prepared
Despite some significant
economic headwinds

11 large-scale projects
off the East Coast had full federal approval, several had started construction and the country's first utility-scale project was
fully up and running
. Meanwhile, a supply chain for manufacturing turbine parts, underwater cables and specialized ships had started to take root in the U.S.
The American Clean Power Association, a clean energy trade group, issued a report last summer finding that companies have announced about
$16 billion
worth of investment in offshore wind manufacturing, shipbuilding and port redevelopment projects — work that could support 56,000 jobs by the end of the decade.

""Those tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment are potentially at risk now,"" says Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a think tank that supports the industry.
Trump has railed against offshore wind for decades. He's described turbines as ""horrible"" and falsely claimed they can
cause cancer
. He's also said the industry is killing whales, though scientists say there's
no evidence of that
.
On his first day back in office, the president signed an
executive action
that paused all federal permitting for new offshore wind projects and set in motion a broad review of what he says are the industry's environmental and economic harms.
""This has had a tremendous chilling effect on the offshore wind sector,"" Ohleth says. ""There is a high degree of uncertainty and a high degree of chaos that is leading to real challenges and backsliding for the sector.""

Furchtgott-Roth calls wind turbines ""unsightly"" and says they make the country ""less competitive,"" arguing the electricity they generate is intermittent and too expensive. She believes the Northeast should meet its growing electricity needs by building more pipelines to bring in natural gas from other parts of the country.
"" We have so much natural gas. We have so much oil,"" she says.
Politics
Trump has declared a 'national energy emergency.' What does that mean?
But many energy experts say this is unlikely.
"" We're not going to be building new pipelines into New England,"" says Dennis Wamsted, a Boston-based analyst with the non-partisan Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. ""I mean, nothing's impossible, but it would be very controversial.""
Many Northeast states have imposed regulations that
make it hard
to build new pipelines precisely because they want more renewable energy instead, Wamsted says. Even without those restrictions, building pipelines in the region would still be challenging and costly because the Northeast is so densely populated.
Plus, he says, the region has some of the best conditions for offshore wind in the world.
""You have this offshore resource, which you can pull in through a transmission line,"" he says. ""You haven't disturbed a whole bunch of people and you have that power coming right into the demand center.""
New England, alone, expects to
need
at least 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2050; that's about equal to the entire capacity of the current regional grid.
Back in New London, Mayor Passero stands at the edge of a dock near the downtown; the giant turbine components at State Pier are clearly visible across the water. Despite the current uncertainty, he believes offshore wind will eventually supply a significant amount of energy to the Northeast, simply because states want to tap this giant source of renewable power right off the coast.
Construction is still advancing on a handful of large-scale wind farms along the East Coast. One of those projects, Revolution Wind, is being staged from the new pier in New London. When it's completed, another project is set to begin.

Whether that happens, and whether more projects come up behind it, remains to be seen. But Passero has his fingers crossed.
""I'm optimistic that this is just a hiccup,"" he says. ""I also don't believe that we have an energy future in this country unless we harness the offshore wind."""

In the past, NOAA contracts would be reviewed when end dates neared, or during prescheduled interim reviews. Rarely did contracts lapse. It is out of the ordinary for the commerce secretary to personally review them, current and former NOAA officials told NPR.
""Decisions are being made with little or no regard for the technical merit of the value of the contracts,"" says Rick Spinrad, who led NOAA during the Biden administration.
The Commerce Department did not return NPR's request for comment.
NOAA studies Earth's oceans and atmospheres, researches and manages the United States' oceanic fisheries, and is home to the National Weather Service. If you get your weather from an app on your phone, the data that feeds that forecast is collected and processed by NOAA. The agency has
shed hundreds of employees
in recent weeks through firings and retirements, the outcome of the Trump administration's efforts to slash the size of the federal government. Further cuts to staff and programs are expected at the agency in the coming weeks.

Websites nearly went down
Some contracts have come under review because they are set to expire. Others, like a contract with Amazon Web Services, are being reviewed early.
The AWS contract served NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research branch, the main research arm of the organization. Science from OAR helps improve weather forecasts, understand Earth's changing climate, and track hazards like tornadoes and hurricanes.
It runs sites that make NOAA data and information accessible to the general public, like the websites for the Climate Program Office, the Sea Grant program, and drought.gov. Those sites are hosted by Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud platform.
Cancellation of the contract would have led to those sites going dark overnight on April 4, a source inside the agency told NPR. It is unclear whether the sites and the data and information they host would be recoverable. But an internal analysis, viewed by NPR, suggests ""100% unrecoverable data loss"" was possible.
Staff members at OAR were informed that the contracts were under review and likely to be canceled on April 3, according to three staff members within the agency who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution. The news set off an overnight scramble to figure out ways to back up the sites or find other ways to host them because there was no plan for how to preserve the sites or the critical information they contain.
Last-minute negotiations led to a reprieve — the AWS contract must be renegotiated by the end of July. But the near lapse sent NOAA staff into triage mode.
If the sites had gone down, or go down in the future, farmers looking for seasonal drought forecasts would encounter a dead link. Coastal managers looking for ways to protect their communities from high-tide flooding wouldn't find
mapping tools
to help them figure out where to focus their efforts.

The dropout would also have affected work at the National Severe Storms Laboratory, the group that works on severe weather research. NSSL uses Amazon Web Services to help ingest radar information that feeds into weather forecasting. Catastrophic
rain, storms and tornadoes
ripped across the U.S. last week.
Other projects under threat
NOAA relies heavily on contractors for both personnel and services. For some of its offices, contractors make up about half of all personnel.
That reliance on contracts has put much of the agency's work in limbo.
Some 50% of the personnel who work with NOAA's Office for Coastal Management are contractors,
for example
. OCM operates tools like the
Digital Coast
, which coastal managers use to help plan for coastal flooding or future infrastructure placement. Those staff members have been furloughed until later in the year, the state of their future contracts unclear, according to a NOAA staffer speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
Other contracts under review are for services. Last week,
Axios reported
that another major contract that supported a key National Weather Service program came within hours of lapsing. The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System is used to process meteorological data and communicate it across the agency and to the public.
Another contract that nearly lapsed last week could have resulted in communications failures during the extreme weather that swept across the Midwest and East in recent days, according to a NOAA staffer who was not authorized to speak publicly. And the contract with an AI company that provides translations of National Weather Service emergency alerts into other languages lapsed April 1.
Contracts for routine services to the National Marine Fisheries Service are also in play, jeopardizing the office's ability to update fish catch limits.
NOAA staff members fear ongoing disruptions to their work if contracts continue to be canceled or allowed to lapse.

The marble office building near Capitol Hill is a world away from Tom Atkinson's home above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. The boss of an electric company in Kotzebue, Atkinson would rather be there, on the freezing edge of the Chukchi Sea. But he's in Washington, D.C., waiting for a meeting with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, to plead for help.
Kotzebue is one of scores of communities
caught up in a funding freeze
as the Trump administration
looks to boost the fossil fuel industry
while
rolling back climate and environmental initiatives
that started under former President Biden. The Energy Department had promised to pay for batteries that can store electricity from wind and solar plants in northwest Alaska, Atkinson says, reducing how much diesel fuel has to be shipped in to run generators. But once President Trump took office, he says the funding Congress approved was cut off.

""It's extremely frustrating,"" Atkinson, who runs the Kotzebue Electric Association, says before he's ushered into Murkowski's office. ""As far as we're concerned, energy shouldn't really have a political stripe attached to it. It's just for the benefit of all of our members and our cooperative,"" he adds.
""They just want the lights to go on. They want the rates to be affordable. And we can't continue to do that without continued support.""
Atkinson was part of a group of about 50 leaders from rural communities in eight states — mainly in the western U.S. and Alaska — who travelled to Washington last week to urge lawmakers to preserve funding for climate and environmental projects that is threatened by the Trump administration.
Organized by a nonpartisan group called United Today, Stronger Tomorrow, the trip was part of a larger effort by cities, states and civil society groups to stop the administration from withholding investments Congress authorized under the country's first major climate policy, the
Inflation Reduction Act
, and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
. There's also
a push to dissuade Republican lawmakers
from getting rid of tax credits that support clean energy projects.
""This unsteadiness, uncertainty is impacting the ability to move important projects, everything from agriculture projects, clean-energy projects, building roads, building bridges,"" says Paul Getsos, project director at United Today, Stronger Tomorrow. Those disruptions are having an outsized impact in rural communities, Getsos says, which have struggled for years to attract investment and retain jobs.

Rural leaders say climate, environmental funding shouldn't be political
Lenise Peterman huddled in a crowded hallway with a staffer for Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican. Peterman, the Republican mayor of Helper, Utah, a couple hours south of Salt Lake City, came to Washington to try to pry loose money from the EPA that's supposed to support job training and to weatherize homes on the Navajo Nation.
""It's not Republican, it's not Democrat — it's about helping those people who are most disadvantaged in our communities,"" Peterman says.
Without government funding, ""projects can't happen,"" Peterman adds. ""We can't stand up job-training programs, and those are so meaningful, especially in rural areas.""
Curtis Yanito, who's part of the southeastern Utah Navajo and a delegate on the Navajo Nation Council, puts his arm around Peterman as he describes the benefits that federal investments could deliver in his community, which suffers from high unemployment and poor infrastructure.
""If you come and visit our nation, we're like a third world country there,"" Yanito says. On the Navajo Nation's reservation, which is spread across parts of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, the

A spokesperson for Curtis, Adam Cloch, pointed to a previous statement in which the senator expressed support for clean-energy tax credits.

A few years ago, Hyundai Motor Group triumphantly
announced
it would be opening a new plant near Savannah, Ga. — a plant that would
exclusively
make electric vehicles.
""We heard the clarion call of [the Biden] administration to hasten the adoption of new electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions,"" José Muñoz, then the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America,
said in 2022.
But at the plant's grand opening last week, as executives and politicians praised Hyundai's multibillion-dollar investment in the region, the thousands of jobs that come with it, and the plant's advanced manufacturing technology, something was conspicuously missing from all the speeches.
Sponsor Message
The word ""electric"" wasn't mentioned once.
That's not just a shift in rhetoric. Over the last few years, Hyundai has changed its plans: Instead of being a dedicated EV plant, it will also make hybrids.
""When we started this project, originally, everybody thought, 'OK, the world is going to be fully electric,"" Muñoz told reporters after the grand opening ceremony. (He's now the CEO of the entire global company.) ""We were also thinking that way. But soon we realized that the pace of electrification was not going to be as fast as everybody thought.""
EV sales
grew slower
than companies had anticipated.
Hybrids
, meanwhile, took off.
""So then very quickly, we decided we're going to produce also hybrid vehicles here,"" Muñoz said.
This trend is happening industrywide. Companies such as Ford, GM and Volvo have all slowed some EV plans and focused more on hybrids.
Business
Trump's pulling a U-turn on EVs, but not much has changed — yet
It's hard to ignore that this is happening as the government is
pulling a U-turn on EVs
. Under President Trump,
regulations
that would push automakers to make EVs are being rewritten, tax breaks helping consumers buy them
are at risk
, and funds for EV chargers
are frozen
.
Some EV advocates have been alarmed about what this could mean for sales. During a Zoom call with reporters on the day of the opening ceremony, Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, congratulated Hyundai but also warned: ""The Trump administration's war on EVs poses a serious threat to EV sales, to the electric vehicle industry and the EV market, and therefore to the state of Georgia.""
Sponsor Message
Hyundai executives, for their part, are adamant that government policy never drove their decisions in the first place.
""Building plants on the assumption of incentives is not a good decision,"" Muñoz says. If the government changes plans — as indeed it has — ""What am I going to say? 'Hey, we invested $12.6 billion, so I made a mistake, I'm sorry?' No.""
Still, it's undeniable that government policy can influence sales. Tax rebates and
abundant chargers
can change what people buy. So while Hyundai's shift toward hybrids started before Trump took office, it's fortuitous timing now.
Similarly, the expansion is not a response to tariffs; these plans were in place long before Trump announced a new
25% tariff on imported cars
. But as Kia COO Steve Center put it, the timing turned out to be ""convenient."" (Kia is part of Hyundai Motor Group and will also build vehicles at the new plant.)
To be clear, the auto industry isn't giving up on EVs. Hyundai's electrified vehicles have sold well, and automakers like to emphasize that EVs are quiet, fun to drive and cheap to maintain. And — less important to consumers, but top of mind for companies — automakers fear that if they don't invest in EVs, they'll cede an entire market segment to the
Chinese companies leaning into them
.
But automakers are pulling back, slowing down and talking about their EV plans in more measured tones.
Or, when they're onstage at a grand opening, not talking about them at all.

In the global race for critical minerals, one little-known international agency has long held the keys to a potential motherlode — vast quantities of metals located on the remote seafloor.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has worked for more than a decade to draw up regulations for a future deep-sea mining industry. Those efforts continued this week as negotiators from around the world convened at ISA headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica.
Now, though, one mining firm says it plans to move forward — with or without that rulebook in place.

Your Next Car May Be Built With Ocean Rocks. Scientists Can't Agree If That's Good
The Metals Company
, a Canadian startup, says it will seek approval this year to launch the world's first deep-sea mine in the eastern Pacific Ocean,
by working with
one of the few countries that never joined the ISA: the United States.
Some delegates and observers at the ISA meeting in Kingston condemned the move, saying it could lead to poorly regulated mining and harm ocean health.
""This is a desperate, very dangerous announcement,"" said Louisa Casson, an activist with Greenpeace International. ""It's a slap in the face to international cooperation.""
Gerard Barron, CEO of The Metals Company, said he made the controversial decision after the ISA
missed deadlines
for finalizing its regulations. He hopes the Trump administration can provide a quicker path to mining approval.
""The U.S. is showing very strong leadership at a time when industrialization and jobs have left the U.S.,"" Barron said. ""They need to rebuild. They need metals to do that.""
Why mine the ocean floor?
Scientists
know little
about the deep seabed. Most of the ocean floor
hasn't been mapped
. Researchers believe most species living there remain
unidentified
. But one thing is certain: There's a lot of metal down there, including key materials used in technology like electric car batteries.

The U.S. Geological Survey
has estimated
that a single swath of the Eastern Pacific, known as the
Clarion Clipperton Zone
, contains more nickel, cobalt and manganese than all combined terrestrial reserves. These metals (plus copper) are bound up in potato-shaped deposits called
polymetallic nodules
, which form over millions of years as minerals in the seawater accrete around bits of organic matter. Those nodules are scattered across the sandy seabed of the Clarion Clipperton Zone, an area about half the size of the contiguous U.S. that sits between Hawaii and Mexico.
Those nodules have tempted would-be miners for decades. Mining firms
claim
the deep seabed could provide a major new source of minerals independent of China, which
controls the supply
of many critical minerals.
A Vancouver-based startup, The Metals Company, says it's ready to launch the world's first deep-sea mine in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Here, researcher Andrew K. Sweetman explains how samples are obtained during a 2021 study on mining's potential environmental impacts.

How would deep-sea mining work?
To retrieve the nodules, mining firms plan to send uncrewed collector vehicles down to the bottom of the ocean. The Metals Company vehicle, which is about the size of a school bus, would crawl along the seabed, hoovering up nodules and sending them through a miles-long vertical tube to a ship waiting on the surface. (Some observers describe this system as the world's
longest vacuum cleaner
— but for critical minerals instead of dust bunnies.)

The global race for rare earth materials is on, and the U.S. is losing it
In 2022, The Metals Company completed a
field test
of this system in the Clarion Clipperton Zone, which the firm deemed successful. Next, the company wants permission to begin commercial production in the region.
After working through the ISA for years, The Metals Company now says it will apply for ""exploration licenses and commercial recovery permits"" from the United States by the end of June.
Congress passed
a law
in 1980 to regulate seabed mining, but The Metals Company would be the first firm to apply for a commercial mining license under it.
What are the environmental impacts?
Nobody knows for sure, since deep-sea mining has never been done at commercial scale.
Sponsor Message
Supporters of seabed mining claim it will be less destructive than mining on land.
Barron, The Metals Company CEO, points to Indonesia, the world's
leading nickel producer
, where mining happens in biodiverse rainforest regions. In contrast, he argues, the vast, sandy plains of the deep seabed harbor far less life.
""For some reason, people think it's OK to go digging up rainforests to get the metals underneath them, yet we're debating whether we should be going to pick up these rocks that sit on the abyssal plain? Something has got screwed up here,"" Barron said in an interview with NPR earlier this month.
Many marine scientists and policymakers disagree.
Researchers say they've identified
more than a dozen
ways seabed mining could damage ocean ecosystems. Animals including sea sponges and anemones
grow on the nodules
, so removing nodules would destroy that habitat.
Sediment plumes
released from mining operations may harm creatures adapted to the clear waters of the deep ocean.
Noise pollution
from seabed mining could interfere with animal navigation and communication.
Polymetallic nodules containing certain critical minerals can be found scattered across the seabed in some parts of the ocean. Here, manganese nodules found off the Southeastern U.S. in 2019.

""Ecosystems will be deeply harmed,"" said Gina Guillén-Grillo, an ISA delegate from Costa Rica. ""Species that we don't even know will be eliminated, because we don't even know what's down there.""
Costa Rica is one of about three dozen ISA countries that have called for a precautionary pause on mining activity, at least until regulations are complete. Hundreds of researchers have also
called for a pause
on deep-sea mining until scientists learn more, which could take years. Some companies —  including automakers and tech firms like BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo, Google and Samsung — have
pledged not to use
seabed minerals.
Some mining companies say damage could be mitigated with new technology. One startup,
Impossible Metals
, is developing a fleet of underwater robots that would hover above the seabed, instead of crawling along it. The robots would use mechanical arms to pluck nodules that have no visible life on them. The company claims this method would eliminate sediment plumes and reduce noise pollution, though the technique hasn't been tested at the extreme depths where mining would occur.

Who decides if mining happens?
Individual countries regulate mining within their
Exclusive Economic Zones
, generally extending 200 miles from the coast. A handful have begun permitting the exploration for seafloor minerals, including Japan, the Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea and Norway (though Norway
paused
its permitting process late last year).
But most of the seabed lies beneath the High Seas, beyond the control of any country. That's where the ISA has traditionally had jurisdiction.
The ISA was launched in 1994 by the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea
, a treaty colloquially dubbed the
Constitution for the Oceans
. It includes every major economy with a coastline
except the United States
, which never ratified the treaty.
Polymetallic nodules, like this manganese nodule, form over millions of years as minerals in the seawater accrete around bits of organic matter.

The ISA has granted
31 contracts
allowing member countries (and partnered companies) to explore for seabed minerals, mostly in the Clarion Clipperton Zone. China has snapped up five of these exploration contracts — more than any other country.
But nobody has moved from exploration to exploitation. That's in part because the ISA hasn't finalized regulations for commercial-scale extraction. ISA negotiators have spent more than a decade
drafting
the mining rulebook, which will cover everything from environmental rules to royalty payments.
ISA countries
set a goal
of finalizing the regulations this year. But key issues in the draft rulebook remain unresolved, and negotiators appear unlikely to meet that deadline.
What could happen next?
It's unclear. The Metals Company previously said it would apply for a commercial mining license from the ISA on June 27. Thursday's announcement throws that application into jeopardy.
Some observers had questioned whether such a move would even be legal.
""I'm deeply concerned with the prospect of unsanctioned mining taking place in areas beyond national jurisdiction,"" said Liz Karan, director of ocean governance at The Pew Charitable Trusts, a research nonprofit, in an interview earlier this month. ""That would be contrary to international law.""

Guillén-Grillo, the delegate from Costa Rica, told NPR that the ISA has sole authority over mining on the international seabed: ""This belongs to us, and the decisions should be made by us.""
The United States has traditionally respected the ISA process as
customary international law
, and the State Department sends representatives to observe ISA meetings. Multiple U.S. government agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.
After The Metals Company's announcement on Thursday, Barron told NPR that the ISA's incomplete mining rulebook, after more than a decade of negotiations, was evidence that multilateralism had failed.
""The world needs strong leadership and the U.S. has that right now. What's happening in Kingston,"" said Barron, referring to the ongoing ISA meetings, ""is not working.""

Homeowners in Los Angeles have started the long process of rebuilding after the destructive wildfires in January. Some are constructing homes that are much less likely to burn when the next wildfire hits. That's because California
is one of the few states
with building codes that require using fire-resistant materials in places prone to wildfires.
Still, thousands of other homeowners in the urban center of Altadena are about to rebuild without wildfire-resistant materials, because they live outside a state-designated wildfire zone.
For some of those people, the rebuilding requirements are about to change in the coming months.
Sponsor Message
California fire officials just
released long-awaited maps
that expand the areas where wildfire building codes apply and that show fire risk is only increasing. Under the new maps, an
additional 1.4 million acres
statewide is now considered at high or very high risk on land for which local governments are responsible.
In the footprint of the Eaton Fire that hit Altadena, the expanded zone for wildfire building codes now includes more than 500 additional homes and buildings, according to an analysis by NPR. Los Angeles County must adopt the new zones by late July, which means those property owners have roughly four months before the more stringent rules take effect.
The move is a rare example of a community strengthening rebuilding rules after a disaster, in the hope of preventing similar destruction in the future. Governments often
loosen construction and permitting rules
after disasters, facing immense pressure to speed up the rebuilding process.
Patrick and Ruth Fong's home burned home still shows signs of the toys their kids used to play with. After late July, rebuilding it will require meeting wildfire building codes, based on new state regulations.

Research shows
fire-resistant construction can dramatically improve the chances that a house survives. Many of the building materials are commonly available, like fiber cement siding, and overall, construction costs
can be roughly the same as a standard house
.
Still, even with the newly expanded zones, more than 7,800 buildings in the area burned by the Eaton Fire fall outside those zones and won't have to follow the more protective wildfire building codes. Wildfire experts say with so many houses to rebuild, Los Angeles is facing a critical moment to ensure communities are better prepared for future disasters. Wildfires are getting more intense and are spreading faster as the climate gets hotter, and across the Western U.S., many homes rebuilt after fires
aren't constructed to withstand future ones
.

""This is the only house our kids remember,"" Ruth says. ""We were only able to recover some mugs and the kids' clay objects they made in art class at school.""
Now, two months after the disaster, they're also starting to envision what could be. They've met with a contractor to plan what they'll rebuild and are now finalizing the floorplan.
""There's been so much grief and sadness, but then you have some glimmers of hope,"" Ruth says.
Ruth and Patrick Fong debated whether to stay in Altadena after they lost their house in the Eaton Fire. It's the second time a wildfire has burned the property.

Just after the fire, the Fongs weren't sure they wanted to stay. Altadena sits next to the dry shrubland of the San Gabriel Mountains and this was the second wildfire to hit their property. Before the Fongs owned it, the Kinneloa Fire also destroyed the home in 1993.
""We had in our heads, we have to build it and sell it, because what if it happens again?"" Patrick says. ""You know, all these terrible things we're thinking about.""
But like many Altadena residents, the Fongs feel connected to their community and especially close to neighbors on their cul de sac. So, they've started talking to their contractor about ways to make the house better able to withstand a wildfire by using fire-resistant building materials. That cost has to be balanced with the other financial constraints of rebuilding, as the Fongs figure out how far their insurance settlement will go.

""With fireproof construction, how much more is that going to be and how much can we really afford?"" Patrick says. ""Because we're already maxing out our policy.""
Newly expanded fire zones show homes at risk
Like thousands of other Altadena residents, the Fongs so far are not required to rebuild with fire resistant materials. That's because California's wildfire building codes, known as ""chapter 7A,"" only apply in areas that are deemed to be at risk. Those
""wildfire hazard zones,""
as they're known, are mapped by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

California's
wildfire hazard maps
are the bedrock of the state's wildfire policies. In addition to determining where wildfire building codes apply for new construction, property owners in very high risk zones must clear flammable vegetation around buildings. Wildfire hazard zones must also be taken into consideration in land use planning by local governments, including ensuring there are enough evacuation routes.
The maps were first released in 2008, putting California on the forefront of wildfire planning. Many Western states
still lack statewide fire risk maps
. But as wildfires have become more extreme, fire experts pushed California to update the maps, since the original maps only forecast fires
under fairly weak wind speeds
and don't take into account high wind conditions that can drive bigger infernos. (Insurance companies typically have their own wildfire risk maps that they use to determine rates for customers.)
The newly released wildfire zones include properties that burned in the Eaton Fire. Pacific Palisades, where the other major fire burned in January, was already in a high risk wildfire zone, so wildfire building codes apply to the more than 6,800 buildings destroyed there.
Under state law, Los Angeles County must adopt the new wildfire hazard maps by July 22nd. According to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, that means if residents in the newly expanded zones get their building permits approved after the maps are adopted, the wildfire building codes will apply.
Sponsor Message
Beginning in 2026, the requirements will expand again to include any properties in the ""high"" hazard category of the wildfire maps. That will mean about 1,000 additional properties in the Eaton Fire area will be required to use wildfire building codes, if their permits are approved next year.
Still, even with the new wildfire maps, the majority of homes destroyed in the Eaton Fire won't be required to be built to resist future wildfires. California's maps calculate the hazard from fires spreading in wildland areas, but don't take into account what happens when fires spread from house to house.
""I thought the very high fire severity zones were really going to reach deep, deep down into Altadena, and they haven't,"" says Los Angeles County Fire Department deputy fire chief Albert Yanagisawa.
The costs and benefits of wildfire building codes
The change in the maps is causing some nervousness in Altadena.
""Some people I see rushing to decide what their rebuild is before that map comes out, which puts into question whether they're thinking about the community or their bottom line,"" says Nic Arnzen, a member of the Altadena Town Council.
California Wildfires
More houses are being built in wildfire-prone areas. Los Angeles has a plan to stop
Researchers have shown that using fire-resistant materials makes homes less likely to burn, especially since most homes are ignited by tiny embers carried by the wind. Even in an extreme wildfire, fire inspectors find some houses remain seemingly untouched, like
in the Los Angeles fires
as well
as the wildfire in Lahaina, Maui
.
One study found houses built with California's wildfire building codes
are 40% more likely to survive
.
An analysis by FEMA
found using California's building codes could save $24 billion in damages to single-family residences over a 75-year timeframe.
California's wildfire building code calls for
fire-resistant roofs and siding
, as well as using attic vents that don't allow embers to be blown inside a house. It also calls for enclosing roof eaves so the undersides are less prone to igniting. They only apply for new construction or when houses have a major renovation.
Altadena is likely to face more wildfires, experts say, so rebuilding after the Eaton Fire is a crucial time to make the community more resilient to fires.

""These are often materials commonly used on the market, widely available,"" Barrett says. ""Things like asphalt roofs. Things like Hardie plank fiber cement siding. Very, very common, very affordable.""

The additional cost of meeting the codes can be
a few thousands dollars
, according to a study from Headwater Economics and the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, a research group funded by the insurance industry. Adding even more fire-resistant features, or more costly options like metal roofing, can add up to 13% to the overall construction cost.
Some Los Angeles homeowners could find the additional costs will be paid by their insurance company, if the policy specifies it
covers bringing a house up to code
. Still, not all policies cover those costs.
Los Angeles County officials say they're looking for funding options for homeowners who might struggle with the costs.
""One of the commitments I've made is looking at grant opportunities to see where we can allow people to apply that may not be able to afford it, to harden or do things that would benefit in case of future fires, and see how we can offset the cost,"" says Los Angeles County supervisor Kathryn Barger.
Rebuilding Los Angeles with wildfires in mind
With a history of frequent wildfires, Los Angeles
has long understood how vulnerable
many neighborhoods are. Some homeowners rebuilding after the Eaton Fire aren't likely to follow wildfire building codes if they're not required to, especially given that some are underinsured.
California Wildfires
What LA did right before the fires — and why it wasn't enough
""Even if they're not going to have to comply, we're going to be strongly encouraging it for future resiliency,"" says Amy Bodek, director of regional planning for the County of Los Angeles. ""We've been on this trajectory to look at long range plans that will prevent future disasters from affecting so many people. We're certainly not going to prevent the disasters, but how can we minimize strategically the harm to individuals and properties?""
Los Angeles County recently
limited the amount of housing that can be built
in the foothills of Altadena, where wildfire risk is highest. The region is facing a massive housing shortage, but considering the fire risk, is directing development to denser urban corridors closer to public transit.

Altadena officials say they're hoping to rebuild a much safer community, including putting electric power lines underground so they pose less of a risk. Utility lines have started wildfires in high winds and are still being investigated as a cause of the Eaton Fire.
""We have an opportunity to show people how to create a community that can live in peace and harmony with the natural disasters around them,"" Arnzen says. ""I don't want to waste the opportunity.""

President Trump has signed an executive order directing
state and local governments
to ""play a more active and significant role"" in preparing for disasters. For months, Trump has said he's considering getting rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the country's disaster response arm.
""I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,"" Trump
said while visiting the Los Angeles fires
in January. ""FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.""
But emergency management experts say Trump's order technically wouldn't do much to shift responsibility. Currently, local and state governments are already in charge of disasters. The question is whether the Trump administration will begin withdrawing the
federal resources and funding that states rely on
.
Sponsor Message
When a major hurricane, flood or wildfire hits, FEMA starts working on a disaster only when requested by the state government. The agency organizes thousands of federal workers who help in disaster response and process claims for millions of dollars in aid. Even then, states and local governments still remain in charge.

Without FEMA, states would need to find thousands of additional personnel to inspect damage, distribute disaster aid and plan the rebuilding of public infrastructure. Without federal funding, states would face billions of dollars in recovery costs. After Hurricane Irma in 2017, Florida relied on
more than $5.5 billion dollars
from the federal government.
FEMA also helps states prepare for disasters, which can reduce the damage they cause and the number of lives that are lost.
One study
from the National Institute of Building Sciences, a non-profit research group, found that federal investment of $27 billion since 1995 to prepare infrastructure for flooding will ultimately save $160 billion. Many state emergency management offices also
rely on federal grants to pay their employees
.
While many states advocate for simplifying FEMA's process for distributing disaster aid, they say FEMA is still a vital partner. As the climate gets hotter, hurricanes, floods and wildfires are getting more intense. FEMA is now responding to
three to four times more disasters now
than it did in the 1980s.
Sponsor Message
""It seems counterintuitive to discuss, in a time when we have more and more severe events, when states need more and more help, that we would provide less and less federal resources to support those states,"" says Tim Manning, a former deputy administrator at FEMA under the Obama administration.
How states work with FEMA
As soon as Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina in 2024, emergency managers knew they had a monumental task ahead.
The storm left a broad swath of destruction in its wake. Heavy rainfall,
exceeding 30 inches
in some spots, washed out roads and flooded homes and buildings across many towns, some becoming almost impossible to reach.
Climate
What the firings at FEMA could mean for the next hurricane or wildfire
When disasters are larger than both local and state governments are able to handle, they can call in federal help by requesting a federal disaster declaration. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper
made that request
the day the storm hit, setting the stage for federal resources to come in, like FEMA. Still, FEMA doesn't take over the disaster responses.
""The locals are in charge of their county and their situation and the state of North Carolina advises FEMA on what we need,"" says Justin Graney, chief of external affairs for North Carolina Emergency Management.
FEMA is also responsible for marshalling resources from the entire federal government, including from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""FEMA doesn't have any helicopters,"" Manning says. ""It doesn't have any aircraft, doesn't have any ships. FEMA's role is to coordinate all those resources from the federal government in support of the states. They are just the organizers.""
More than 8,000 federal workers arrive
As North Carolina residents began taking in the damage from the storm, the immediate needs were for shelter, hot food and medical help, as well as search and rescue for missing people.
Sponsor Message
""Pretty much everything we had to throw at the storm, we threw at the storm,"" Graney says. ""And then 39 other states sent us resources and teams. So it was a massive response to what turned out to be a massive, catastrophic storm.""
That response included
8,500 federal workers
for both Hurricanes Helene and Milton, a storm that hit Florida two weeks later. FEMA brought in its own staff from all over the country, but had to call in personnel
from other federal agencies
to fill the need.
During major disasters, FEMA sends thousands of staff, as well as organizing personnel from throughout the federal government, to help with disaster aid and search and rescue.

One of FEMA's primary roles is getting aid to disaster victims, what's known as ""individual assistance."" That includes funds for finding temporary housing and funding repairs on homes, when it's not covered by the owner's insurance policy. Some assistance is designed to reach disaster victims within days, allowing them to replace food, pay for temporary hotel stays and replace vital items like medications and clothing.
To process those claims, FEMA's call centers for Hurricane Helene got
more than half a million calls per week
, a volume so high that many went unanswered.
Without FEMA, states would need to find and train a similar staffing effort, able to process disaster aid in a very short time. Many states share resources, sending teams to other states in times of need. But as disasters get more intense and frequent with climate change, states have fewer resources to share.
""Those resources become taxed,"" says Claire Connolly Knox, a professor of emergency and crisis management at the University of Central Florida. ""That's where having a federal entity come in and be able to assist and backfill those resources, whether that's people, goods, services, is important.""
FEMA also gives funding to local governments and tribes to rebuild public infrastructure after disasters, including schools, roads, bridges and parks, known as ""
public assistance
."" Ahead of disasters,
FEMA offers grants
so communities can make their infrastructure less likely to be destroyed.
Sponsor Message
How FEMA could be reformed
Trump has ordered the creation of a
new council to do a ""full-scale review""
of FEMA, including recommendations for how to reform the agency. Their report is due within six months of their first meeting, which has yet to take place.
Trump's latest executive order mandates that a new ""National Resilience Strategy"" be drafted, with the goal of ""reducing taxpayer burdens through efficiency."" Project 2025, the conservative policy agenda organized by the Heritage Foundation, says the majority of disaster costs
should be shouldered by the states
.
""For far too long, state and local governments have neglected investing in resilience, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness because they can count on an unlimited backstop from the federal government — an unsustainable and irresponsible strategy that has resulted in needless destruction and deaths of everyday Americans,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an emailed statement.
Climate
Exclusive: Trump administration drops work on stronger building codes for disasters
Still, many states don't want to see FEMA go away. The
Trump administration's recent firings of more than 200 employees at FEMA
are already likely to make the agency less able to handle future disasters.
""Our relationship with our federal partners is critical,"" North Carolina's Graney says. ""That relationship remains important and one we rely on.""
If the bulk of disaster response falls to states, some could struggle to keep up. While larger states like Florida and California have well-established emergency management offices, smaller states have
few resources
and staff, especially to prepare for disasters ahead of time. Infrastructure and landscape-scale projects that help protect communities from wildfires and floods are largely out of reach for local government budgets.
""Not every state had the capacity to do all the phases of emergency management, including preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation,"" says Knox. ""This is especially true in local counties in which there might be one person designated to do emergency management, especially in rural areas.""
Sponsor Message
Emergency management experts say there are areas where FEMA's disaster response efforts could be improved, especially in the
complex and sometimes lengthy process
for local governments to get funding for rebuilding. FEMA walks a difficult line, balancing distributing aid quickly with taking enough time to ensure there's no fraud or abuse.
""That is probably where we should be focusing most of our efforts is understanding the complexities that have developed in the way the federal government oversees money going to recovery efforts and making that simpler,"" Manning says.
At a
recent congressional hearing
about FEMA, the director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, Jeffrey Smitherman,
testified
that it would be best for FEMA to handle giving out individual assistance. But he suggested that public assistance for local governments be given directly to states as a ""block grant,"" instead of being managed by FEMA. That could give states leeway to spend the money without federal oversight.
Giving states funding directly also could mean that infrastructure is rebuilt with a patchwork of regulations. Under the Biden administration, projects getting federal funding were
required to be built to a higher standard
, constructed to withstand future flooding. The Trump administration had previously repealed that rule during its first term.
Without federal guidelines to build with climate change in mind, experts say many states have little incentive to build projects better, since the financial responsibility for rebuilding after the next disaster largely falls on the federal government.
""It's malpractice as emergency managers, as government officials, to not plan for what might impact their citizens,"" Manny says. ""That's at the fundamental core of planning for disaster response."""

Johnson's organization was helping plant some 1,600 trees in the neighborhood when the funding was suddenly canceled. The project was managed by the New Orleans nonprofit
Sustaining Our Urban Landscape
, or SOUL, which had been awarded a $1 million grant from the Forest Service.
SOUL's executive director, Susannah Burley, said she found it absurd to cancel the funding as an equity program.
""That has nothing to do with this grant funding. The word 'equity' is pervasive in the grants that were funded by this, but in a totally different context,"" Burley said, adding that in this context, equity meant planting trees in neighborhoods without them.
""Funding would have allowed us to finish planting the Lower 9th Ward, which is a really big deal,"" Burley said. ""That'll be the third neighborhood that we've planted every street.""
That would have made significant progress towards a citywide goal to reach 10% tree canopy coverage in every neighborhood, as part of an effort to combat

Peterson said he's looking for other funding, and working with local organizations to get a few trees removed for free.
In New Orleans, Arthur Johnson said the loss of federal grant money might slow down the work, but won't stop it. His organization will work with SOUL to find other sources of funding and plant just a few trees at a time.

A jury in North Dakota has found Greenpeace liable for defamation, trespassing and a suite of other infractions in a case that pitted the environmental advocacy group against Energy Transfer, the company that built the Dakota Access oil pipeline.
On Wednesday, the jury awarded the pipeline company hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Greenpeace says the total judgment, approximately $660 million, could significantly damage the organization and represents an attack on free speech within the country.
""I think Energy Transfer, and this is probably true of many big oil companies, is trying to send a message to other organizations that if you try and hold power to account, we will try to silence you. We will try to bankrupt you,"" says Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. Raman said Greenpeace will appeal the decision.
Sponsor Message
The case focused on Greenpeace's participation in protests at the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota
during its construction nearly a decade ago
. It raised key issues around the limits of free speech and whether private companies can claim restitution from protesters who block or delay a project.
The jury decision ""should be cause of concern to people who participate in peaceful protest, who organize advocacy efforts, who show up in solidarity,"" says  Raman.
But the oil company praised the verdict. Energy Transfer's counsel for the trial, Trey Cox, wrote in a statement: ""Peaceful protest is an inherent American right; however, violent and destructive protest is unlawful and unacceptable."" The decision, he writes, represents ""reckoning and accountability for Greenpeace.""
In 2016, the pipeline began to face opposition from the
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
, whose reservation sits near the route. They argued the pipeline posed a threat to their water supply where it passed near their reservation — a claim Energy Transfer has denied.
Thousands of demonstrators, including many from Greenpeace,
joined the tribe
in their protests, citing concerns with tribal sovereignty alongside environmental and climate concerns. Demonstrators camped out for months to try to block the project, drawing worldwide media attention.
Greenpeace had a significant presence at the protests and used its global reach to draw attention to the opposition. In the lawsuit, Energy Transfer says Greenpeace participated in a publicity campaign that hurt the project and the firm's bottom line — allegedly raising the cost of construction by at least $300 million.
Sponsor Message
Greenpeace denies the allegations, saying it played a limited, supporting role in the protests, which were led by Native American groups. The organization said the lawsuit was an attempt to quell their First Amendment rights and have a chilling effect on future protests, especially those related to climate change and environmental activism.
Organizers of protests against the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline spoke at a news conference near the building site in 2016. The company that built the pipeline, Energy Transfer, says the protests delayed its efforts and cost it millions in lost revenue, amongst other costs.

Jennifer Safstrom
, a First Amendment legal expert at Vanderbilt University, says the lawsuit had a chilling effect on protest even before the verdict. ""This jury verdict is obviously a huge and monumental milestone in the case because of what the implications are, not just for Greenpeace, but for other advocates,"" she says. ""Advocacy defendants will now potentially face huge liability in possibly similar litigation,"" even in fields outside the realm of environmental advocacy.
Oil executive says, ""They're going to pay""
The Dakota Access Pipeline moves crude oil 1,172 miles from the booming oil fields of North Dakota to a pipeline hub in Patoka, Ill. The $3.8 billion project was completed and placed into service in 2017.
Most of the protests focused on a small section south of Bismarck, N.D., that crosses under a reservoir on the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation.
The tribe argues it wasn't adequately consulted in the federal planning process, that construction crosses sacred sites and that the pipeline poses a pollution risk to its water supply. Energy Transfer
disputes all those assertions
.
The tribe's demonstrations gained worldwide attention, and thousands of protesters traveled to and camped out in the area along the proposed pipeline route in 2016 and 2017. Police and protesters clashed, with
officers using pepper spray and ""nonlethal ammunition""
to remove demonstrators from federal land. Police said protestors set fires and threw rocks at officers. At one point,
police sprayed water on the crowd
as temperatures dropped below freezing.
The protests ultimately delayed the pipeline's completion by several months. Oil began flowing through the infrastructure in 2017. In the lawsuit, Energy Transfer said the delay, damaged property and public relations costs resulted in demonstrable financial harm to the company.
Sponsor Message
In a 2017 interview with CNBC, Energy Transfer co-founder Kelcy Warren explained why his company was taking the unusual step of suing protesters.
""What happened to us was tragic,"" Warren said. ""They knew that the things that they were saying about us were inaccurate — things like we were on Indian property, that we didn't communicate with the Standing Rock Sioux … I mean, it was just crazy stuff that they were saying, and we were greatly harmed by that.""
In the lawsuit, Energy Transfer claimed Greenpeace lied about the company's work to solicit donations, which the company says it used to organize and fund protests, including ""violent attacks on Energy Transfer employees and property.""
""Everybody is afraid of these environmental groups and the fear that it may look wrong if you fight back with these people. But what they did to us is wrong, and they're going to pay for it,"" Warren said.
Warren has been a vigorous defender of his company and the oil and gas industry. Energy Transfer
launched a website
specifically about the benefits of oil and gas and to counter Greenpeace's claims.
""You can't sue a movement""
Greenpeace USA
said before the trial that a loss in the North Dakota case
could drive the group toward ""financial ruin, ending over 50 years of environmental activism.""
Greenpeace argued that Energy Transfer was being disingenuous about the purpose of the lawsuit, which the company denies.
""This case is simple. Big Oil wants to silence its critics,"" said Raman during a call with reporters in February. Raman claims Energy Transfer is ""abusing the legal system to silence critics"" by filing a ""Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation"" (SLAPP) case.
Such cases are usually designed to cost opponents money and force them to spend time defending against the case, according to the
Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute

North Dakota is

that does not have anti-SLAPP laws, which makes it easier to get such cases dismissed and recover costs from plaintiffs who file them.
Josh Galperin, an associate law professor at Pace University who has been following the case, told NPR earlier this year that the $300 million in damages Energy Transfer sought represented a lot of money for Greenpeace but was not as significant to Energy Transfer. The company generated more than $82 billion in revenue last year.
""I tend to think that their real concern isn't the financial loss,"" Galperin said. ""Their real concern is the persistence of the protest — the way it is capable of turning public opinion.""
The jury's decision was even higher. ""The number is just astounding,"" says Michael Burger, the executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. ""One way or another, the effect of a verdict like this, without question, could be to chill speech, to make opponents more reluctant to be vocal in their in their opposition to major projects,"" he says.
Before the ruling, Greenpeace USA said such a large financial award to Energy Transfer could threaten to bankrupt the organization. But the group says the message that fossil fuels are heating the climate and hurting people will continue.
""You can't sue a movement,"" Raman says.
More than 400 environmental and other groups signed an

The Trump administration has sparked confusion over the future of two national monuments in California that President Biden designated before he left office. Biden established Chuckwalla National Monument and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument on Jan. 14, protecting land considered sacred by area tribes.
The confusion started on March 14 when President Trump issued an executive order rescinding several Biden-era actions. That order did not mention the monuments, but on the same day, the White House issued a
fact sheet
that called for terminating nearly a million acres that ""constitute new national monuments that lock up vast amounts of land from economic development and energy production."" That language
was later removed
.

When asked to clarify the monuments' status, the White House pointed to the president's
executive order from March 14
, which makes no mention of changes to the monuments.

Presidents do not have the authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act to revoke national monument designations, although they have modified boundaries in the past. Trump significantly reduced the boundaries of two national monuments in Utah during his first term in office. Conservationists and tribes worry something similar could happen in California.
For now, Chuckwalla — named after a wide-bellied lizard — remains protected from new development and critical mineral mining as a national monument.
Ancestral land
Chuckwalla National Monument spans roughly 710,000 acres where the Mojave and the Sonoran desert meet. It's home to chollas and saguaros cacti, and the endangered desert tortoise. At least six tribes  have a cultural tie to the land, including the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.
Gary Resvaloso, who is a Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla tribal member, drives his truck down a sandy road in Chuckwalla, pointing out red rock canyons. The color, he explains, comes from the story of coyote, who grabbed the heart of Mukat, one of the Cahuilla Tribe's creators, from a burning funeral pyre. ""As he ran with it, the blood dripped on the mountains out here and on the area,"" Resvaloso says. ""It's called
Quawish-Ulish
— that means red rock.""

Those artifacts, he says, are what the tribe hopes to safeguard now that Chuckwalla is a national monument. The monument doesn't have a visitor center yet and a makeshift dirt lot now serves as a parking area. Now comes the task of tribes working with the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees much of the land, to figure out how to co-steward the monument.

Nada Wolff Culver signed the interim management plan for the monument before she left the BLM in January. She says a future plan involves co-stewardship through a possible tribal commission.
"" If one is established by the tribes, it leaves it up to the tribes to decide how they would like to create that, not to tell them what to do as sovereign nations,"" Wolff Culver says.
The tribes are close to forming a tribal commission, according to Medart. Once that's established, he says, that will dictate how the tribes do business on these lands and how they will incorporate traditional and cultural knowledge into caring for Chuckwalla.
A shrinking town's worry
Not everybody's thrilled with the monument. Blythe, a town of around 18,000 people, is about an hour east of Chuckwalla. City officials have eyed some of the land for development and job opportunities.
Blythe's population has declined
nearly 20% in the past decade
and city leaders fear worst is to come after one of the city's main employer s— a state prison — closed last year.
Sponsor Message
Mayor Joey DeConinck has called Blythe home for more than 50 years, and Vice Mayor Johnny Rodriguez was born and raised in the area. They say the new monument takes up too much land.
They were hoping parts of what is now Chuckwalla National Monument could open the door for future energy production. They look to their neighbors near the Salton Sea, where lithium deposits could be developed to mine the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries. DeConinck and Rodriguez wonder if something similar could be discovered at Chuckwalla.
""It's all BLM land already. It's already all protected,"" Rodriguez says. ""Yet, if this monument status is not adjusted, at least on the eastern end of it [where Blythe is], all it's going to do is kill any future potential development that could help our area, our grandchildren.""
In February, Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum
issued an executive order
to look into removing obstacles for developers in areas filled with natural resources. That could make the exploration for critical minerals in places like Chuckwalla easier.
Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace denied that there's a plan to review national monuments.
""The Department of the Interior is currently conducting an internal review of the reports submitted to the Secretary,"" Peace said in an email. ""At this stage, we are assessing these reports to determine if any further action is warranted, and we remain dedicated to ensuring that all items are thoroughly evaluated as part of our internal management process.""
Rodriguez and DeConinck hope the Trump administration will adjust Chuckwalla's boundaries, to make way for any future energy production.
Concern for public lands
The confusion and speculation over public lands have left the tribes and conservationists worried about the fate of Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands National Monuments and other public lands.
In 2017, Trump shrunk the boundaries of Bears Ears in Utah from roughly 1.3 million acres to around 228,000. He then reduced Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half, taking the nearly 2 million acres designation to about 1 million. As
NPR reported at the time,
the reduction of both monuments marked the largest reversal of national monument protections in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
At that time, Trump called the original designation of the monuments ""abuses of the
Antiquities Act
,"" which allows presidents to establish legal protections on federal lands that are culturally, historically or scientifically significant. During a December 2017 press conference, Trump said the act gave ""enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of the people who actually live here, work here and make this place their home.""
The move was largely seen as a way to open up mining for uranium and coal, as well as oil and gas drilling. Biden restored both monuments to their original size in 2021. Now there's worry after recent communication from the White House that Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands in California could have boundaries reduced or even be eliminated.
Davina Smith is Diné (Navajo Nation) and the co-chair for the Bears Ears Intertribal Coalition. She says tribes are fearful that Bears Ears could be taken back once again.
"" But we continue to move forward — knowing of why we continue to advocate and do what we can to protect these lands,"" she says.
Public lands weren't always a contentious issue, according to Paul Sutter, who specializes in U.S. and global environmental history at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
He says the economic decline of the 1970s started to push people on the political right against laws like the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, ""as getting in the way of economic development, getting in the way of property rights.""
Ranchers, county commissioners and some of Utah's congressional leaders wanted to get rid of regulations on public lands as part of what became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion. They wanted
more control over grazing rights
, and state control over federal lands,
so they could ultimately drill for more oil and gas on public lands
. Sutter says by the 1980s, public land and environmental politics started to become intensely partisan.
Sponsor Message
The Wise Use Movement also developed in the 1980s. Farmers, miners and the timber industry called for more access to logging, mining and oil extraction on public lands.
But Sutter says public lands have become more popular than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic. That's why he's hopeful that, over time, the public will really come to see these lands as part of their history.
And he says seeing tribal interests increasingly reflected ""in those public lands is also a really hopeful thing.""
Medart shares that sentiment. He says the Quechan people have roamed the deserts since time immemorial.
"" We've not only survived within these deserts, but we've thrived within this region,"" he says. "" And we're going to continue to do that no matter what happens today or tomorrow or next week. We will always thrive within this region."""

NEW YORK — Retired pediatrician Max Van Gilder, 79, loves to cook and calls himself an ""early adopter"" of new technology. That's put him on the leading edge of a new segment of the appliance industry focused on climate-conscious consumers.
Van Gilder replaced a gas stove in his Manhattan apartment last year with an electric Copper induction stove. ""Its serial number is 72,"" Van Gilder says as he fries pork and boils water for spaghetti carbonara.
Induction stoves typically need special wiring or a larger plug, adding hundreds of dollars in electrical work to the cost of the appliance itself. But Van Gilder's stove plugs into a conventional outlet. A battery under the oven charges through the night and powers the stove when he cooks.

How gas utilities used tobacco tactics to avoid gas stove regulations
Changing from gas to more climate-friendly electric appliances often involves expensive retrofits, such as hiring an electrician or contractor and sometimes upgrading electricity service from the utility. But a growing list of companies have begun to offer appliances that make switching easier and cheaper, with designs that allow customers to plug them into a standard outlet.
""What you're seeing is the desire of consumers to start to move to all electric appliances and then manufacturers responding with products to overcome one of the key barriers to that,"" says Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition.
Three products dominate this emerging market segment now — battery induction stoves, window heat pumps and plug-in heat pump water heaters. And manufacturers have plans to offer more appliances.

Nearly one-third
of the greenhouse gases heating the planet come from buildings — much of it from burning natural gas in appliances. That's why one

increasingly cleaner grid

Van Gilder wanted to get rid of his gas stove for both climate and safety reasons. ""As I'm getting older, I was afraid that I would leave the gas on,"" he says. And he wanted an induction stove because it's more efficient, complies with
New York's plan to eliminate fossil fuels from large buildings
and he likes the control they offer a cook. Induction stoves heat pans with magnetism rather than flames or an electric coil.

""The only thing about an induction stove is it needs 220 volts of electricity,"" Van Gilder says. He asked his co-op apartment board if it was possible to install the wires needed, but it was too expensive. A friend told him about the Copper stove with a battery that plugs into a regular outlet.
After using it for a few months, Van Gilder says he likes the stove and has discovered a few extra benefits.

""The kitchen doesn't heat up like it used to,"" he says. Because the stove heats the pot directly, it doesn't send heat into the room like a gas or traditional electric stove. He says the smooth cooktop is easier to clean too. The Copper stoves do have a hefty price tag, though.
""The base price is $6,000. There's a tax credit that brings it down to about $4,000,"" says Sam Calisch, Copper founder and CEO. He says that can still be a bargain for older, multifamily buildings with gas pipes that sometimes leak climate-warming methane and need to be fixed or replaced.
""In these cases, we install for less than half of what it costs just to fix the gas system and then we allow that building to retire that old, aging infrastructure and decarbonize,"" Calisch says.
Window heat pump
Heat pumps
have become popular with consumers, even inspiring
a sultry R&B song
. They provide heating and cooling with less energy than traditional furnaces and air conditioners. But heat pumps usually require expensive modifications to a home by contractors, plumbers and electricians.
Now, manufacturers are making heat pumps that plug into a standard outlet and can be installed in a window. Joe Soto, 69, is testing one in his Woodside, N.Y., apartment.
""I call ourselves the guinea pigs,"" Soto says, chuckling. He says he's happy to be a part of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) test because he and his wife are comfortable year-round now. NYCHA used to heat Soto's home with steam radiators. ""It wasn't very reliable. There were times that we spent many winters freezing in the cold,"" he says.
Joe Soto says the window heat pumps installed in his New York City Housing Authority apartment are more reliable than the old steam radiators.

Soto's window heat pumps were made by the company

, which says its $3,800 appliance is designed to be easy to install. Most of the company's customers are building owners, who can save money by avoiding expensive retrofits.

""We can install our system without any building modification, without any electricians, without holes in the wall, without asbestos mitigation, without scaffolding,"" says Vince Romanin, Gradient's founder and chief technology officer. ""It is a 30-minute install.""
Eventually, Romanin says he'd like to sell the company's window heat pumps directly to tenants.
Plug-in heat pump water heater
Heat pump technology is showing up in water heaters, too, including some that
plug into a regular outlet and are designed to replace gas water heaters
.
""We knew we wanted to go green as much as possible and cut the gas cord if we could,"" says Laura Nakamura, who replaced her gas water heater with a plug-in heat pump water heater last year in the garage of her Concord, Calif., home.
""It was all done in one day. It wasn't a major overhaul,"" and she says the new model works as well as the old gas one. ""It's just as hot. And the water is still just as wet.""
She has noticed the new water heater is louder. She measured it at 60 decibels on a smartphone application — nearly as loud as her clothes dryer. That's not a problem for her, since the water heater is in her garage. And Nakamura noticed a benefit — because a heat pump takes heat from the garage to warm water, it leaves the garage cooler, something she looks forward to in the summer.
Sponsor Message
Plug-in heat pump water heaters also take longer to recover, once you've used the water in the tank.
""Because of the slower recovery, we do often recommend that those are installed in warmer states,"" says James Courtney, director of product management at water heater manufacturer Rheem. "" Really, the main thing is the incoming ground water temperature.""
Warmer water coming into a house requires less energy to make it hot. Courtney suggests talking with a plumber or contractor because there are ways to mitigate the slower recovery time.
Climate
Layoffs and potential closures of key facilities raise worries about NOAA's future
""A solution might be that you just upsize your tank if you have the space,"" he says. If your old gas water heater held 50 gallons of 120 degrees Fahrenheit water, you could get a 65 or 80 gallon version of the new climate-friendly model and heat the water to 140 degrees.
""We have a built-in mixing valve attached to the water heater,"" Courtney says, and the water heater will ""then mix that hot water with the incoming cold water down to the 120 degrees."" That mimics what the old gas water heater used to provide.
These new water heaters cost about $2,000 more than a comparable gas one. But government incentives can reduce some of the extra cost. Nakamura navigated that sometimes-confusing process through the company
Quit Carbon
, which also helped her find a plumber.
""In addition to not using plastic bags at the grocery store, it's one of those things that if people have the means and it's time to upgrade to a water heater, this is something that I think people should be looking into,"" Nakamura says. She's the vice mayor in Concord and also has been active with
a local clean energy group
.
Courtney says plug-in heat pump water heaters are still a small portion of the water heater market, but he says they're the fastest growing. And manufacturers are working on more products that are designed to easily replace gas appliances.

Phoenix heat is notorious for the harm it causes in the short-term, like heat stroke and heart problems. Just last year, temperatures there topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit for a record-breaking 188 days. More than 140 of those days surpassed 100 degrees.
A
new study
published in
Science Advances
shows that prolonged heat exposure of that magnitude can even modify how people's genes behave, speeding up aging at the molecular level and potentially impacting people's long-term health.
The impact is ""similar to the effect of smoking and drinking,"" says Eunyoung Choi, a gerontologist at the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the study's lead researcher.
Sponsor Message
The study looked at people over 56 living across the country with very different heat experiences. People from extremely hot parts of the country like Phoenix — where the heat index, a combination of temperature and humidity — topped 90 degrees for more than half the year, looked biologically about 14 months older, epigenetically, than similar people living in cooler places like Seattle, where fewer than 10 days of each year exceed that threshold.
That may not sound like an enormous difference, says Boston University gerontologist Deborah Carr, who wasn't involved in the study, but for the person affected, ""it's just a tremendous strain not only on their own lives and the lives of their families and caregivers, but also has a larger societal impact.""
Research links premature aging with an earlier onset of health issues like
dementia
,
diabetes
and
cardiovascular disease
. The sooner those symptoms begin, the more of a toll they take on people's well-being and productivity, Carr says.
""If that's something that takes you out of the workforce for a year, that makes you go to the doctors every day for a year, that increases your medication budget — it really can have tremendous impacts,"" she explains.
Epigenetic aging
The researchers tracked the biological age of people in their study by looking for subtle changes in their DNA after different periods of exposure to heat, from a few days of extreme temperatures to several years.
Sponsor Message
""We know that some people seem to age faster than others, and that's because biological aging doesn't always match chronological aging,"" Choi says.
Biological age is often correlated with chemical tags that accumulate and are shed from people's DNA over time, a process called methylation; it is often referred to as ""epigenetic aging."" ""DNA methylation acts like a light switch for genes — so it can turn them on and off,"" Choi says.
Methylation doesn't change the genes themselves, but modifies the way those genes work — sometimes for the better, but oftentimes not. Many studies in both animals and humans have shown that DNA methylation patterns change over time and can be used as a sort of molecular clock, ticking along as people age.
Epigenetic aging can accelerate because people don't eat well or don't get enough exercise. But it is also associated with emotional or physical stress, as well as exposure to environmental harms like air pollution ""and, in this case, heat,"" Choi says.
The researchers looked at blood samples from more than 3,600 older adults across the U.S. and assessed people's epigenetic age. They could figure out how much heat those people experienced over a few days, a few months, one year and six years prior to that sample collection using climate and weather models looking into the past, taking into account both temperature and humidity — factors that influence the danger of different heat conditions.
The outcomes were clear. People who experienced more heat over the long-term aged faster, biologically, than those living in cooler places. That's even after taking into account people's financial status, education, physical activity and whether they smoked.
Researchers have known for years that heat exposure correlates with long-term issues like worsened risk of cardiac problems. But ""the mechanisms for how that happens haven't been clear,"" says Tom Clanton, a physiologist and heat expert at the University of Florida's College of Health and Human Performance, who wasn't involved in the research. This work, he says, begins to explain how those delayed effects might happen. At the genome level, heat exposure makes ""you sort of accelerate your way towards an old heart, and an old vulnerable heart,"" he says.

Climate pressures
Heat causes plenty of shorter-term health problems for people of all ages. The number of emergency department visits rises during heat waves, as does the number of cardiovascular issues, kidney problems and even deaths not directly linked to the heat.
The risks rise as human-driven climate change accelerates, says Choi. The number of extreme heat days in the U.S. could rise by
20 to 30 days across much of the country
by the middle of the century, according to the country's National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive accounting of past and potential future changes to the country because of climate change.
At the same time, as heat risks grow because of climate change, Carr says, the
U.S. population is aging
. Older people's bodies generally
deal with heat less adeptly than younger people
.
Sweating capacity decreases
. Less blood flows to the skin where it can be cooled. Some medications interfere with people's ability to manage heat.
But heat makes life harder for everybody, not just older people, says Robert Meade, a heat physiology expert at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""It's basically like if you're trying to tread water and someone hands you a brick,"" he says. ""It's extra strain on all your physiological systems. It's just an extra weight that needs to be responded to in order to maintain homeostasis.""
The next step to connect heat exposure to specific health problems, Meade thinks, is to further personalize the analyses, because even within the hottest parts of the country, people experience very different heat exposures. ""What people actually experience in their homes, whether they're in an overheated mobile unit or they have air conditioning available, can be wildly different temperatures,"" he says.
Researchers indicate that the next frontier of this work should look at how heat exposure within people's homes shapes health outcomes. That kind of specific, personalized risk assessment could help scientists further pinpoint exactly how heat hurts people, Meade says — and maybe even how to prevent the damage or reverse it."

LIMA, Peru — A
landmark climate lawsuit
opens in a German court Monday, as a Peruvian farmer sues a German energy giant over the threat to his home
from a mountain lake overflowing with glacier meltwater.
Saul Luciano Lliuya, 45, lives in Huaraz, a city in Peru's central Ancash region, in the heart of the Peruvian Andes. It lies more than a mile below Palcacocha, a high altitude lake that is
brimming with 35 times more water than usual. Peru is home to
70% of the worlds tropical glaciers
— but they are disappearing rapidly.
Should it burst its banks, Palcacocha's waters would 'likely wipe away Lliuya's home, as well as the homes of an estimated 50,000 other people living in and around Huaraz, potentially with them inside.
Sponsor Message
In response, Lliuya is using a German property law more normally wielded against anti-social neighbors to target
RWE
, a power company whose coal-powered energy plants make it one of Europe's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.
With the support of
Germanwatch
, a local nonprofit, Lliuya has calculated that since it began operating in 1898, RWE has accounted for 0.47% of all human-generated carbon emissions. Lliuya is therefore asking for 0.47% of the cost, roughly $18,000, of building a dyke that would protect him and Huaraz from a catastrophic breaching of Palcacocha's banks.
The case is the culmination of a near 10-year legal battle for Lliuya, and is the first to be heard of nearly 50 similar climate civil claims in different nations around the world — including one brought by the city and county of Honolulu, Hawaii, against Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and other oil giants.
Although its verdict might not be binding on other jurisdictions, the case does provide a legal template with many other countries, including the United States, having similar property legislation.
RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility. It argues climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors. If found liable, they argue, then even ordinary motorists could potentially be sued for their vehicles' carbon footprint. The climate crisis should be resolved by government policy, the company says, not in court.

The risk of Palcacocha washing away thousands of lives is all too visceral for people in Huaraz. In 1970, an earthquake in the same precipitous valley triggered a landslide that killed an estimated 25,000 residents.
Sponsor Message
But avalanches, landslides and calamitous flash floods are just the most dramatic consequences of climate change in the Peruvian Andes.
Many communities are losing their water sources from glacier melt, while others are seeing local streams discolored and turned toxic by recently exposed rocks full of heavy metals and which were once covered by thick sheets of ice. The seasons are also changing, making agriculture more difficult, while pests, including moths, are thriving.
""It is scary, the risk from climate change. For example, it has been raining. Even the rivers that pass through the city have risen,"" Lliuya told NPR. ""There is a lot of fear and the lake's levels have risen. People are very worried.""
Germanwatch lawyer Francesca Mascha Klein, who is working on the case with Lliuya, added: ""We want Saul and the people of Huaraz to live in safety. No one should live in fear of losing their home due to the climate crisis. Polluters have to step up and pay the true price of their business model.""
The case is being held near RWE's head offices, in a district court in Hamm, northwestern Germany. It is expected to take several weeks."

The Environmental Protection Agency
just announced plans to reconsider 31 rules and policies that largely address climate change or aim to reduce pollution from burning fossil fuels.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described it as ""the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.""
But announcing big changes to environmental rules doesn't undo facts on the ground overnight.
EPA provided no details about whether it plans to weaken rules or get rid of them
, as NPR reported. Instead, EPA's announcement is the first step in what is likely to be a lengthy process to remake the rules and policies it targeted.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax and railed against wind turbines, energy efficiency standards and electric vehicles. He
signed an executive order
that halted billions of dollars to a vast range of climate and environmental projects under the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The impact of that move was felt immediately: community groups and corporations alike found their grant money frozen, leading to stalled projects and layoffs.
Climate
EPA announces dozens of environmental regulations it plans to target
Amending federal rules and regulations is different — changes are likely to be felt over a much longer time horizon.. That's because the foundational environmental laws of the country prescribe a process for making and unmaking rules. The EPA has to publish what its new rule will look like–a ""proposed rule. EPA then seeks public comment on the rule and responds to that feedback. It also must get input from other federal agencies that might be affected by the changes EPA proposes. Industry and advocates have an opportunity to weigh in. The process takes months, if not longer, before a final rule is issued.
If the Trump administration tries to short-circuit these processes, its critics will likely sue and the courts could rule against EPA on process grounds. In any event, environmental advocates are likely to sue the regulator on most, if not all, the announced changes. That could further slow things down.
Sponsor Message
Another variable is the administration's plan to slash EPA's staff and spending. Changing rules in a way that survives court challenges takes specialized staff. But cuts loom for EPA at a time when it has pledged to move simultaneously to redo 31 rules and policies, a huge lift regardless of staffing.
The impact of EPA's vision will play out in Washington, the courts and ultimately, in communities. NPR will continue to report on what all that means for human health, the climate and the broader environment."

the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""
The EPA didn't provide details about what it wants to do with the regulations — whether it will try to weaken them or eliminate them entirely. In most cases, the agency said it is reconsidering rules that apply to things like climate pollution from vehicles and power plants, wastewater from coal plants and air pollution from the energy and manufacturing sectors.

The Story Behind The Story
Editor's Note: EPA says it will roll back climate rules. That could prove complicated
The list the agency put out is a ""roadmap"" of the regulations it will try to roll back in the coming year, says Jason Rylander, legal director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group.
""This EPA is planning to take a wrecking ball to environmental law as we know it,"" he says. ""The intent appears to be to neuter EPA's ability to address climate change and to limit air pollution that affects public health.""
The EPA said in an email to NPR that it doesn't have additional information to share about its plans for changing or repealing environmental regulations.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin
said in a news release
.
Rylander says the agency didn't have to release a list of rules it plans to challenge. ""But they've made clear that they intend to start that process,"" he says.
Overhauling federal environmental regulations requires a so-called rulemaking process that usually takes a couple of years, Rylander says.
""But we've seen that this administration wants to move with a speed that we have not often seen,"" he adds. ""I suspect that you'll start seeing proposed rules coming out on each of these in the coming weeks.""

Any effort by the EPA to rollback environmental rules will almost certainly face legal challenges.
""EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin today announced plans for the greatest increase in pollution in decades,"" Amanda Leland, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. ""The result will be more toxic chemicals, more cancers, more asthma attacks, and more dangers for pregnant women and their children. Rather than helping our economy, it will create chaos.""
Leland said her group ""will vigorously oppose Administrator Zeldin's unlawful attack on the public health of the American people that seeks to tear down life-saving clean air standards – putting millions of people in harm's way.""
EPA says it's reconsidering rules for power plant emissions
The EPA says it will reconsider rules finalized under the Biden administration that
limit climate pollution from power plants
.
Power plants are the second biggest source of planet-heating greenhouse gasses behind transportation, according to the EPA. Under the regulations, existing coal and new natural gas-fired power plants that run more than 40% of the time would have to eliminate 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions, the main driver of global warming.
The rules followed a 2022
Supreme Court ruling that limited the EPA's options
for regulating power plant emissions. Justices said that without a specific law, the agency cannot force the entire power generation industry to move away from fossil fuels toward less-polluting energy sources. So, instead, the EPA under the Biden administration created regulations governing individual power plants.
When the new rules were finalized last year, Manish Bapna, chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council, predicted they would ""drive up investment, innovation, and good jobs in the clean energy economy of the future"" and give industry the certainty it ""needs to meet growing demand in the cleanest, cheapest, most reliable way possible.""
However, some in the utility industry warned the restrictions would threaten electric reliability.

""The path outlined by the EPA today is unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,"" Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in a statement at the time.
Zeldin said in a news release on Wednesday that the EPA is ""seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.""
Pollution from cars and trucks is also on EPA's list
President Trump has made it a priority to roll back the Biden administration's multi-pronged push supporting the transition to electric vehicles. Changing EPA standards limiting air pollution from vehicle tailpipes is a crucial part of that agenda.
Former president Barack Obama toughened fuel economy and EPA vehicle emission standards. During Trump's first term, automakers had lobbied for looser rules, but were
caught off guard
by how dramatically Trump rolled them back. The next few years were
chaotic
; some automakers struck a voluntary deal with California to
keep meeting their stricter rules
, even if it wasn't legally necessary.
Under the Biden administration, the standards grew
stricter over time
with rules designed to accelerate a transition to EVs. The current EPA standards do not mandate a certain number of EVs, but they set emissions rules so strict that automakers would essentially have to manufacture a large portion of vehicles without emissions — as much as two thirds of the vehicles sold by 2032 — in order to meet the rules.
With EV sales growth slowing, some automakers have wondered if that is still feasible and called for the rules to be adjusted. But the industry is also frustrated with the whipsawing of regulations back and forth, which makes it difficult to plan future products. In a statement Wednesday, the trade group representing automakers called for a ""balanced approach.""
Environmental and public health groups support the more aggressive standards, which reduce pollution that causes asthma and heart disease as well as fighting climate change. So do consumer advocacy groups: the EPA had also
estimated
the new rules could save drivers up to a trillion dollars in gasoline over the life of the rules. But many critics, including the oil industry, have said the rules undermine consumer choice by favoring EVs.

EPA says it's rethinking whether climate pollution endangers public health
Underlying a lot of the EPA's actions on climate change is a
2009 determination
that greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane threaten public health. The EPA now says it will reconsider that so-called endangerment finding, as well as actions the agency took that were based on the determination.
Daren Bakst, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in an email to NPR that the EPA has used the endangerment finding to try to ""control large portions of the economy.""
If the EPA determines that the endangerment finding is no longer applicable, Bakst says it ""would preclude future greenhouse gas regulations."" It could also pave the way to repeal some existing rules, he says.
However, environmental groups say it won't be easy for the EPA to scrap its determination that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. The science showing the warming impact of those emissions has only gotten stronger since the
Supreme Court authorized the agency in 2007
to regulate greenhouse gas emissions if it finds that they contribute to climate change.
""The state of climate science has evolved significantly since the endangerment finding first came out,"" says Rylander, legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""I can't imagine anyone being able to conclude, on the basis of current science, that greenhouse gas pollution does not affect climate and public health. So I'm somewhat baffled that they think they're going to be able to eliminate it and have that stand up in court.""
Rachel Cleetus, policy director with the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, agrees.
""We're seeing climate related disasters mount catastrophically,"" Cleetus says. ""We've seen loss of life from wildfires and extremely intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts. We're seeing so much economic damage from these kinds of extreme climate related disasters.""
Sponsor Message
The utility industry has also raised concerns about getting rid of the endangerment finding. In
a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court
, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a group that represents electric utilities, said allowing the EPA to regulate climate pollution creates an orderly system for cutting emissions while minimizing economic impacts on consumers and businesses. Rolling back the agency's authority could expose companies to a flurry of environmental lawsuits, the group said. ""This would be chaos.""
The EPA has repeatedly reaffirmed the endangerment finding, and in 2022, Congress included language in the Inflation Reduction Act that labels greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
Conrad Schneider, senior director for the U.S. at the Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement: ""This signal to deregulate air pollution is diametrically opposed to the obligation the EPA has to protect public health."""

Despite the Trump administration's wide-ranging attacks on renewables like wind and solar power, the clean-energy industry is on pace for record growth this year, according to government analysts.
The buildout of big solar and battery plants is expected to hit an all-time high in 2025, accounting for 81% of new power generation that companies will add to America's electric grids, the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
said in a recent report
. Including wind projects, the share of new power capacity that's expected to come online this year from renewables and batteries jumps to 93%, the EIA said.
The U.S. needs all the power it can get, because electricity demand is surging for the first time in decades, industry analysts and executives say. That means kickstarting development of
nuclear power
and
geothermal
projects,
burning more natural gas
and, in some cases,
delaying retirement of old coal plants
. But in the scramble for electricity, renewable-energy and battery plants are crucial, analysts and executives say, because they're quick to build and provide electricity that's relatively cheap.

""There is no doubt that the increased demand for electricity over the next decade, coming from data centers and advanced manufacturing, will continue to require vast amounts of renewable energy and batteries,"" Andrés Gluski, chief executive of The AES Corporation, a power company that owns both clean-energy and fossil-fuel plants, told Wall Street analysts recently.
Still, the renewables industry faces potential upheaval. The Trump administration
tried to withhold federal funding
Congress previously approved for climate and clean-energy projects.
Trump also
ordered
the government to temporarily stop issuing or renewing leases for offshore wind projects in federal waters. The
Department of the Interior limited
who at the agency can issue permits for renewable energy projects on public lands, which could slow permitting. And conservatives are pushing Congress to
wipe out tax incentives for clean energy
.
If the disruptions spread, companies could abandon plans to build new power plants. That could dampen economic growth and hamstring efforts to develop data centers for artificial intelligence,
a priority of the Trump administration
. In an interview that
aired Sunday on Fox News
, Trump declined to rule out the possibility of an economic recession this year.
""At a time when we're all very concerned about energy abundance and this administration's broad goal of re-establishing energy dominance, just the idea that we'd be constraining the build of new energy [infrastructure] really feels like it's rowing in the wrong direction,"" says Rich Powell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

Demand for clean energy 'is certainly not going away'
The clean-energy industry has
exploded over the past decade
. Solar, in particular, has accelerated. Meanwhile, growth in the wind industry has slowed because of problems ranging from inflation to pushback on siting projects.
The industry overall has boomed thanks to falling technology costs, federal tax incentives and
state renewable-energy mandates
. The market got another big boost in 2022, when President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which
provided hundreds of billions of dollars
in federal funding for clean-energy projects, among other climate investments.
Corporations like Amazon, Meta and Google have also played a role, signing contracts to buy ever-larger amounts of renewable energy.
""I expect that that will continue,"" says Powell of the Clean Energy Buyers Association. ""The demand is certainly not going away.""
Some big investors seem to take a similar view. Led by
Trump supporter Steve Schwarzman
, the investment firm Blackstone said in February that it
raised $5.6 billion
for its ""energy transition"" business, which in the past has invested in companies that work in the renewable energy industry. Also last month, Brookfield Asset Management
agreed to buy
a U.S. renewable energy business for more than $1.7 billion.
""Renewables will be the biggest beneficiary of growing electricity demand because they are the cheapest option, and [electricity buyers] will always absorb as much of the cheapest source of power before turning to more expensive forms of power,"" Brookfield's chief executive, Bruce Flatt,
told Wall Street analysts in February
.
Congressional Republicans have backed Trump's pro-fossil fuel agenda. But a group of 21 GOP lawmakers recently called for Congress to preserve tax credits that support the renewable energy industry. ""As energy demand continues to skyrocket, any modifications that inhibit our ability to deploy new energy production risk sparking an energy crisis in our country, resulting in drastically higher power bills for American families,"" the
lawmakers wrote
to the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri.

Key conservatives call for backing natural gas instead
Clean energy's draw could wear off as Trump's policies take effect, says Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The Heritage Foundation produced a governing agenda called
Project 2025
that
aligns with many actions
Trump has taken so far. Among its dozens of recommendations, the plan calls for Congress to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which could eliminate tax incentives that lower the price tag for clean-energy projects.
Sponsor Message
""I think that what you're seeing [right now] is people operating with the old prices"" in U.S. power markets, Furchtgott-Roth says. ""But I think that that might change.""
Rather than renewables and batteries, Furchtgott-Roth says natural gas is ""the wave of the future for the United States."" After all, she says, the country has ""an almost infinite supply."" The U.S. has huge reserves of natural gas, but its main component, methane, is a
big contributor to global warming
.
Natural gas fueled about 43% of America's electricity last year,
according to a report
from BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. The country
will almost certainly burn more gas
to meet growing power demand, industry analysts say. Gas plants can produce electricity when it's needed, which regulators say is becoming more important because large parts of the country are
expected to face a growing risk of blackouts
as coal plants retire.
""We are unabashedly pursuing a policy of more American energy production and infrastructure, not less,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Monday at an energy conference in Houston, where he touted the importance of natural gas, according to
a copy of his prepared remarks
. Wright downplayed the role of renewables and called climate change a ""side effect of building the modern world.""

Executives say it will take years to build a lot of new gas plants
A problem with gas plants, though, is that the cost to build them has risen, industry executives say. Gas turbines are also on backorder, and that means companies can't build plants fast enough to meet rising electricity demand in the next few years.
""Renewables and storage are ready now to meet that demand and will help lower power prices. Gas-fired generation is moving forward but won't be available at scale until 2030,"" John Ketchum, chief executive of NextEra Energy, told Wall Street analysts days after Trump's inauguration. NextEra runs one of the world's top renewable energy developers and also has a big natural gas business.

The EIA says solar will account for just over half of new power generation that will get built in the U.S. this year. So far, the Trump administration hasn't targeted solar like it has the wind industry, and developers are moving ahead with projects, says Paula Mints, chief analyst at SPV Market Research, which tracks the solar market. But she says companies are nervous.
Sweeping tariffs from the Trump administration could increase costs across the U.S. energy industry, making it more expensive to build new power plants of all kinds, says John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power, a trade group.
And if Congress gets rid of clean-energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, power prices for homeowners, renters and businesses would go up, and the country would build fewer clean energy projects,
according to a study
commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association.
The result is confusion in the market, leading some businesses to rethink U.S. investments. Days after Trump's inauguration, an Italian company called the Prysmian Group
cancelled plans to build a factory
in Massachusetts that would have supplied undersea cables for offshore wind projects. An Indian solar manufacturer, Premier Energies,
recently told investors
that it paused
plans for a U.S. plant
until it knows what will happen to federal tax incentives. And Aspen Aerogels, an American firm,
stopped construction
of a factory in Georgia where it planned to make components for electric vehicles, citing an ""evolving environment."" In a recent report, Climate Power, an advocacy group,
says more than 42,000 announced clean-energy jobs
have been ""threatened or eliminated"" since Trump took office.
In the face of rising power demand, the last thing the country needs is to slow down clean-energy development, Ketchum told analysts in January.

to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cars, SUVs and other light-duty vehicles account for 57% of transportation-related emissions, and the federal government's huge fleet has some
670,000 vehicles

There were more than 8,500 electric vehicles in the federal fleet as of 2023, according to federal data. That number is likely larger now: In 2024,
the GSA said
the federal government had begun installing more than 25,000 charging ports and had ordered more than 58,000 zero-emission vehicles.
The March 3 memo does not say how many GSA-owned charging stations are

The Trump administration is considering terminating leases for properties housing vital weather service operations and other fisheries operations, according to

, a former official of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
Andrew Rosenberg
, a former deputy director of NOAA's national marine fisheries services, as well as a current NOAA contractor who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing their job. One of the potential lease terminations includes a key weather forecasting center in
College Park, Md
.
NOAA has historically employed about 12,000 staff who work on a range of issues from climate change to managing the nation's multibillion-dollar commercial fisheries. The agency monitors and forecasts extreme weather, including hurricanes and floods, and provides the data that feeds local TV meteorologists' forecasts and the weather apps on your phone.

The agency is also terminating at least four expert advisory committees, according to an email that NPR obtained from the current NOAA contractor. The email details the termination of the Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space, Climate Services Advisory Committee, Marine and Coastal Area-based Management Advisory Committee and the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee.
That NOAA contractor also told NPR that the potential closure of the Maryland weather forecasting facility is especially concerning. ""Anything that is getting canceled with the weather program is a terrible idea,"" the contractor says. ""Loss of an entire facility would hamper our ability to do our jobs, predict the weather properly, help protect people and property.""
McLean says if lease terminations happen, that would be ""remarkably stupid,"" and that a closure in Maryland could mean the agency would have trouble providing accurate forecasts that serve a wide swath of people from mariners to pilots.  McLean says the products at the College Park facility ""are distributed to the weather forecast offices across the country.""
NOAA is part of the Department of Commerce. Neither agency responded to NPR's requests for comment. A White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record to the press said the administration is reevaluating the lease terms but is not closing the buildings.

The terminations included staff at the National Weather Service, which is tasked with generating weather forecasts that millions of people in the U.S. rely on.
As NPR previously reported,
the White House sent a memo to federal agency directors ordering them to prepare plans for ""large-scale reductions in force"" by March 13, though
the picture continues to be
muddled by the administration's frequent policy changes, as well as ongoing legal and administrative procedures.
""Tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hard-working American citizens,"" the memo from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Office of Personnel Management acting Director Charles Ezell states.
It calls the federal government ""bloated"" and ""corrupt.""
The memo orders agency directors to lay off large numbers of staff, save money, and get rid of real estate, all while increasing productivity and providing ""better service for the American people.""
As details on the cuts emerged at locations across the country, current and former workers at NOAA said the cuts threatened key public services, from weather forecasts to wildlife management.

reported that nearly two dozen scientists based at NOAA's Virginia Key offices in Miami were laid off last Thursday, according to a NOAA biologist and a source who worked closely with the agency. Both spoke on the condition of requested anonymity out of fear of losing their job or having funding cut.
They say the cuts are a direct hit to hurricane research and fisheries management vital to protecting U.S. shores.
They confirmed about 16 fired scientists worked in fisheries and a half dozen on hurricane modeling and forecasting.
One of those fired was Andy Hazelton, a meteorologist who worked on improving hurricane forecasts.
He flew repeated missions aboard NOAA's hurricane hunter planes and focused his research on one of the most pressing concerns: hurricanes that intensify suddenly, giving little warning to the public and emergency managers.
Hazelton, who has four young kids, said working for NOAA had been a lifelong goal.
He said he grew up in areas in Central Florida where he's experienced hurricanes, ""so doing modeling and working for NOAA was really a dream.""
At the Virginia Key lab, he helped develop a next-generation hurricane forecasting model as part of a partnership between NOAA and the University of Miami.
The research done by Hazelton and others has helped to dramatically improve hurricane forecasts in a short amount of time. The latest model Hazelton worked on improved track forecasts by 8% and intensity forecasts by 10%,
according to the National Hurricane Center
. That's allowing forecasters to better understand when
those short-fuse storms
might explode and make landfalls more lethal.

With the cuts to NOAA, that progress is threatened across the agency, says Rick Spinrad, the former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration.

Cali, Colombia – Under lush trees drooping with moss and vines, Carlos Hernando Molina whistles as he approaches a herd of brown cows.
This farm, called
El Hatico
, has been in Molina's family since the late 1700s. For centuries his family's cows would graze in open pastures under the hot sun. But in the last three decades, Molina and his family have transformed El Hatico into a radically new environment.
""This is the best hotel for a cow,"" Molina says in Spanish, smiling under his white straw hat. ""It's a hotel with controlled temperatures, very good quality food and the cows sleep placidly.""

The controlled temperatures come from the trees. In 1993, the Molinas planted trees and plants across the farm's 130 acres, which now provide shade to cool the cows. Seed pods from
mesquite trees
and leaves of
other trees
give the cows protein-rich nutrition.
Carlos Hernando Molina walks under the trees at El Hatico. The family has nearly doubled the number of cows per hectare.

This ""hotel for cows"" is something called silvopasture. That's the intentional integration of trees, grasses and livestock. Since adopting this system, Molina says they've almost doubled the number of cows they raise per hectare and
the dairy cattle
— which they also slaughter for beef — make more milk.
That increase in productivity is why some climate researchers see this approach to farming as a key solution for reducing deforestation in South America.
Clearing land for cattle and cows is the
single biggest driver of rainforest loss in the Amazon
. Destroyed forests shrink habitats for endangered species and release planet-heating carbon dioxide. The Amazon is specifically vulnerable because its trees create moist clouds that make rain. If too many trees are cut down
the system could break down
, drying the region and releasing
a dangerous amount of carbon dioxide
.
Environment
At the U.N.'s global biodiversity convention, nations pledge to reverse deforestation
Ultimately, reducing beef and dairy consumption has to be part of the solution for saving the Amazon and reducing climate pollution, says Tim Searchinger, senior research scholar at Princeton University. ""You're always going to benefit the climate more by eating less beef,"" he says.
Still, by increasing the productivity of cattle and dairy farms, silvopasture can decrease pressures to cut down rainforests.  ""The secret sauce in Latin America,"" Searchinger says,  ""is that there are ways to do silvopastoral systems that increase productivity – severalfold.""

More productive land
Across Latin America many dairy cows and beef cattle are raised in an ""unproductive way,"" Searchinger says. You'll often see a few cows, scattered across small farms, not eating particularly well, he says.
Sponsor Message
""It's not a very friendly thing to think about,"" Searchinger says, ""but the reality is that, depending on how well cows are fed, they reach their slaughter weight at different times.""
In carefully designed silvopasture systems, nutrient-rich collections of grasses, leaves, and tree seed pods mean cattle can get to their slaughter weight faster. A shorter lifespan for the cattle means farmers can use less land, says Julián Chára, a researcher at the
Center for Research in Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems
who studies El Hatico and other silvopasture systems like it. And better diets can mean dairy cows can make more milk. Chára and his colleagues studied
ten silvopasture systems in Colombia, Argentina and Mexico
and found milk and meat production increased per hectare on all those farms.
At the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, scientist Jacobo Arango studies two groups of beef cattle. One group of cattle is in a silvopasture system and the other group, pictured, are not.

Arango and his research team have found the group of silvopasture cattle produced significantly less methane
, a powerful planet-heating gas. ""Always the silvopastoral system was performing better,"" Arango says.

Healthier soils
As Molina walks he stoops down to pick up some soil. It's black and soft, like coffee grounds.
Much like peanuts and other legumes,
trees
at El Hatico support bacteria that ""fix"" nitrogen, creating fertile soil without added chemicals. Since creating a silvopasture system, Molina says El Hatico no longer needs nitrogen fertilizers. That saves money, and reduces climate pollution, he says. Manufacturing chemical fertilizers is very energy-intensive and creates about
5% of global greenhouse gas emissions
.
Environment

The trees create shade, which cools the area and helps retain moisture in the soil, Chára says. El Hatico now needs less irrigation, which has helped them get through recent regional droughts.

Improved soil moisture and health is one way silvopasture systems can be an important adaptation for a warming world, Chára says.
A solution with limits
While tropical silvopasture systems can have climate benefits, there are limits, says
Matthew Hayek
, assistant professor of environmental studies at New York University. Silvopasture systems can increase productivity in the tropics, he says, but those gains can be more constrained by the lack of sunlight in
more temperate regions

like parts of the U.S
..

And for silvopasture systems to fully protect rainforests they have to be accompanied by government regulations that penalize deforestation, as well as enforcement, Arango says. ""Deforestation is not a policy issue but a police issue,"" Arango says.

Brazil has

anti-deforestation legislation
, with more

. Colombian
deforestation increased last year
after a 23-year low, largely due to illegal activity, the government says.
And while silvopasture can increase trees, researchers caution about overpromising the rewards.
Working Trees
is a company that sells
carbon offsets
that promise to help farmers plant trees in silvopasture systems in Brazil and the U.S.. The idea is that by planting more trees, silvopasture systems can increase the amount of carbon stored on pastureland, says
Leif Gonzales-Kramer
, chief executive of Working Trees. So far the main purchaser of Working Trees' offsets is
Alpine Investors
, a private equity firm.
Climate
If you get an offer to buy a carbon offset, experts say this is what you should know
There's an inherent problem with the ""
permanence
"" of this kind of tree offsets, says
Danny Cullenward
, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for
thousands of years
,
even tens of thousands of years
. Gonzales-Kramer says their offsets promise to store carbon for 40 years.  ""Our contracts with farmers are 40 years, but we believe that our systems will be in the ground for way longer than 40 years,"" Gonzales-Kramer says.
Still, given the thousand-plus year heating potential of carbon dioxide, Cullenward says a belief in protecting trees for more than 40 years isn't enough. "" The atmosphere doesn't care about your intentions. It doesn't matter what your hopes or aspirations are. That equivalence is missing,"" he says.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began firing staff on Thursday, continuing a wave of government-wide layoffs ordered by the Trump administration. The terminations, which include staff at the National Weather Service, could impact weather forecasting used by many people and industries across the U.S. economy.
It wasn't immediately clear how many people were fired from NOAA. Neither the agency nor the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, responded to messages seeking comment. NPR has confirmed the firings at NOAA through multiple sources who asked for anonymity for fear of retribution.
Some fired employees were given less than two hours to leave the office, according to a source with direct knowledge who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. They said staff that manages NOAA's central weather forecasting models scrambled in that timeframe to transfer access to employees who remain at NOAA.

NPR has seen several copies of a termination letter for NOAA employees, all of whom were in a ""probationary"" period with the agency; the status is applied because they had either joined NOAA recently or been promoted. The letters informed the employees that they were ""not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.""
Impact of cuts to NOAA staff
The impacts of the cuts at NOAA, say experts and agency employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal by the Trump administration, could be profound. The agency has around 12,000 employees that work on a broad range of topics, from conditions in the upper atmosphere to fish in the depths of the ocean.
NOAA monitors and forecasts the
country's weather and hurricanes
, manages oceanic fisheries,
protects coastal resources
and creates and updates maritime maps critical to global shipping. TV meteorologists rely on NOAA data for local forecasting, as does the weather report many Americans read on their phones. Disruptions in NOAA's employee base could, among other outcomes, result in less accurate weather forecasts, experts warn, or delays in updating maritime maps key to safe passage within the U.S.'s oceanic waters.

""Breaking up, defunding, or reducing NOAA's highly integrated workforce will severely impact our nation's economy,"" five of NOAA's former administrators said in an open letter to Congress and the American public. ""It will also make it more difficult to receive weather forecasts, be assured of the safety of seafood, and ensure the timely delivery of purchases from overseas, which are delivered primarily through our nation's ports.""
Timothy Gallaudet
, a former Navy officer and oceanographer who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, warned that weakening NOAA could ""have national security and economic impacts that are really seemingly contradicting the administration's priorities now."" The risks include disruptions to weather operations, marine shipping safety, and military activities.
NOAA also houses and supports
cutting-edge climate science research
. NPR reported previously that several of Trump's January executive orders focused on cutting or
slashing climate programs specifically
. NOAA officials received a
list of terms related to those executive orders
and were instructed to review related grants and programs for potential cuts.
""We all earned our positions,"" says one former employee who worked in fisheries policy within the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of NOAA's offices. They asked to speak anonymously out of fear of retribution from the Trump administration. ""It's so disheartening. And it's really reducing the intellectual and regulatory capabilities of the agency.""
Another NOAA employee, who asked not to be named because of concerns about jeopardizing future employment opportunities, fretted that the move could stunt the agency's work for years to come. ""It's an absolute gutting of young talent,"" they say.
How could this affect NOAA operations?
NOAA's most widely known offices include the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center. NWS produces weather forecasts and relies on a vast network of data collected from locations across the country. That data is fed into the models that create the weather forecasts, which are used daily by millions of Americans, as well as a vast number of industries, including shipping and aviation. Those weather models need active care and monitoring by scientists.
Sponsor Message
Even a small reduction in the amount or quality of data coming in for the weather models can impact weather prediction accuracy. For example, some small percentage of weather observations are
provided by commercial aircraft
; during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when flight activity dropped precipitously, some scientists teased out a
decrease in weather model accuracy
(though others found a
smaller impact
).
NOAA scientists also monitor global climate patterns that have major impacts on the U.S., like the seasonal El Niño and La Niña, which can determine whether parts of the country see droughts or floods. The agency's
long-running rainfall records are used by engineers
around the country, who are required to design roads, bridges and other infrastructure to withstand flooding.
The agency also operates the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, which manages a fleet of scientific and survey ships, along with highly specialized research airplanes. Those ships and planes provide key data for climate, weather, fisheries, underwater mapping, and more.
An employee at NOAA, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said such cuts would have a direct impact on the capabilities of the office to carry out its crucial coastal mapping duties. Those include planned, upcoming projects like creating new ocean floor maps in the Arctic, where climate change is causing sea ice to retreat and opening up new areas for global maritime travel that are poorly charted.
The U.S. currently boasts some of the most sustainable oceanic fisheries in the world, says
Janet Coit
, who led NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, or NOAA Fisheries, under the Biden administration. The office's ability to refine that management could suffer, she says. Cuts, Coit says, could ""hollow the ability of NOAA Fisheries. It raises the question, she says: ""How do you support the growth of our seafood sector while simultaneously eviscerating the agency that's responsible for sustainable management and many other aspects of supporting our seafood sector?""

It will take years to understand the full scope of the impacts of such staff cuts, says Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator during the Biden administration. NOAA is currently one of the premier science agencies in the world, he says, and historically, leaders have been ""able to pick and choose the best and the brightest."" But ""if you lose the intellectual capital, it's going to take decades to get that back,"" Spinrad says."

ILULISSAT, Greenland — When Stella Davidsen Olsen was 12 years old, her father presented her and her twin sister with a choice. Her family owned sled dogs, which can be expensive and a lot of work. Her father asked the girls whether they'd like to take care of the dogs.
""If you don't want to take care of them, we have to put them down,"" Olsen, now 26, recalls him saying.
She and her sister immediately jumped into action, hunting and fishing to feed the dogs, and working to train them to pull sleds across Greenland's snow and ice.

For generations, Greenlanders have relied on sled dogs for transportation and hunting. It's a proud tradition. Today, dogsled rides are a popular activity for tourists who travel to the island. But it's also a part of Greenland's unique culture that is under threat.
The number of sled dogs has been

""One of the reasons is that simply, the traditional fishing and hunting culture is changing,"" Morten Meldgaard, a professor at the University of Greenland, said. Sled dogs are not as common in small settlements, and people are opting to use snowmobiles and other modes of transportation.
But those who have long relied on dogsledding are also having to adapt to a warming climate.
""This means that sea ice is not as common and as widespread as it was earlier on. And so, the use of the sled dogs on the ice is limited,"" he said. ""And so, in that way, the sled dog population is declining because of the warming of the Arctic.""

Olsen is fiercely committed to preserving this part of her homeland's heritage. For her, it's hard to put into words what it feels like to dogsled.

And putting all of this into words will be key to preserving many of Greenland's traditions.
""Our lifestyle is changing. We don't live the same traditional way that we used to. ... Climate change is happening,"" says Manumina Lund Jensen, a Ph.D. student at the University of Greenland. She's working to preserve knowledge about dogsledding through research and by collecting oral histories.
